-   Prince George is just a mascot and is not affiliated with the
    website (he is not my dog)
-   Please do not contact him directly regarding any website issues (see
    home page for contact information)

Some fun facts about Prince George include:

-   He is a loving and energetic Golden Retriever from Melbourne,
    Australia
-   He is a part-time male model and full-time cherished pet
-   He enjoys chasing ducks, drinking puppychinos and watching wild-life
    documentaries on Netflix
-   He is arguably the second most famous Prince George on Earth (help
    make him the most famous!)
-   He would have got 100% in IB Biology if dogs were allowed to sit
    exams

BioNinja App

[bioninja app]

The BioNinja App for iOS devices (iPads and iPhones) is now complete!

It can be found on the iTunes Store:Â Click here

-   If you like it, please give it a positive review!
-   If you donâ€™t like it, shut up! (seriously, itâ€™s free - so
    donâ€™t be a troll)

Please Note:Â Be sure toÂ refreshÂ the app the first time you load it
(to update to latest version)

-   External assets (e.g. songs and animations) will not work until the
    app has been refreshed

More Information:

-   I had to really rush the process in order to get the app released
    before the May 2018 exams
-   Unless there is something seriously wrong, I donâ€™t plan on fixing
    any of the quirks (too hard!)
-   If there are any issues, please just send me an email rather than
    posting a bad review
-   Please be aware that the songs and animations may not work on really
    old devices
-   Also, the sound wonâ€™t work if the phone is set to silent / vibrate
    (you need toÂ unmuteÂ it)

Attention: Android Users

I am trying to get an Android version completed as well, but Iâ€™m not
exactly a tech expert and am having some issues

-   If anyone is proficient at coding and wants to give it a go (for
    free - Iâ€™m not paying for a free app!) - contact me!

Chiasmata

Previous

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chiasmata formation between non-sister chromatids can result in
the exchange of alleles

Â  Â Â 
Synapsis

During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes become connected in
a process known as synapsis

-   The connected homologues are known as a bivalent (bi = two
    chromosomes) or a tetrad (tetra = four chromatids)
-   The chromosomes are connected by a protein-RNA complex called the
    synaptonemal complex

While autosomes always undergo synapsis during meiosis, sex chromosomes
often remain unpaired

Pairing of Homologous Chromosomes via Synapsis

[synapsis]

Chiasmata

While in synapsis, non-sister chromatids may break and recombine with
their homologous partner (crossing over)

These non-sister chromatids remain physically connected at these points
of exchange â€“ regions called chiasmata

Chiasmata (singular = chiasma) hold the homologous chromosomes together
as a bivalent until anaphase I

-   Chiasmata formation between non-sister chromatids can result in the
    exchange of alleles

Electron Micrograph of Chiasmata

[My Image 1] [My Image 2]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing diagrams to show chiasmata formed by crossing over

Â  Â Â 
Chiasmata are X-shaped points of attachment between two non-sister
chromatids of a homologous pair

Chiasmata form as a result of crossing over and hence non-sister
chromatids should show an exchange of genetic material

-   The exchange of genetic material is most easily shown if homologous
    chromosomes are differentially colour-coded

Chiasmata

Crossing Over

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Crossing over is the exchange of DNA material between non-sister
homologous chromatids

â€¢ Â Crossing over produces new combinations of alleles on the
chromosomes of the haploid cells

Â  Â Â 
When chiasmata form between bivalents in prophase I, DNA can be
exchanged between non-sister homologous chromatids

This exchange of genetic material is called crossing over and produces
new allele combinations on the chromosomes

These chromosomes that consist of genetic material from both homologues
are called recombinant chromosomes

Crossing over results in new combinations of alleles in haploid cells
and thus increases the genetic diversity of potential offspring

Forming Recombinant Chromosomes via Crossing Over

[Crossing over]

Overview of Meiotic Recombination

[meiotic crossover]
Drawing Meiosis

Meiosis consists of two divisions and results in the formation of four
daughter cells

-   Interphase replicates DNA in the S phase, so chromosomes should
    initially possess sister chromatidsÂ (Â |Â â†’Â XÂ )
-   The first division separates the homologous pairs
    (Â XÂ XÂ â†’Â XÂ ,Â XÂ ) and hence halves the chromosome number
-   The second division separates the sister
    chromatidsÂ (Â XÂ â†’Â |Â ,Â |Â )Â leading to the formation of
    single chromatid chromosomes
-   By the end of the process, the cells should be haploid (have half
    the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell)

Drawing the Stages of Meiosis

[meiosis simple]
10.1 Â Meiosis

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Meiosis leads to independent assortment of chromosomes Â 
and unique composition of alleles in daughter cells

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Chromosomes replicate in interphase before meiosis
-   Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I
-   Sister chromatids separate in meiosis II
-   Independent assortment of genes is due to the random orientation of
    pairs of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I
-   Chiasmata formation between non-sister chromatids can result in an
    exchange of alleles
-   Crossing over is the exchange of DNA material between non-sister
    homologous chromatids
-   Crossing over produces new combinations of alleles on the
    chromosomes of the haploid cells

Skills:

-   Drawing diagrams to show chiasmata formed by crossing over
Interphase

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chromosomes replicate in interphase before meiosis

Â  Â Â 
Interphase is an active period that precedes meiosis and involves
keyÂ events needed to prepare the cell for successful division

DNA is replicated during the S phase of interphase, resulting in
chromosomes that contain two identical DNA strands

-   These genetically identical strands are calledÂ sister
    chromatidsÂ and are held together by a central region called the
    centromere
-   These chromatids separate during meiosis II, becoming independent
    chromosomes each made of a single DNA strand

If DNA replication did not occur prior to meiosis there would be no need
for a 2^(nd) meiotic division (meiosis I = diploidÂ â†’Â haploid)

-   The fact that DNA replication does occur suggests that meiosis
    evolved from mitosis (where initial DNA replication is necessary)
-   One benefit of the duplication of chromatids is that it increases
    the potential for genetic recombination to occur (more variation)

Chromosome Replication and Separation During Meiosis

[meiotic interphase]
Meiosis vs Mitosis

Mitosis and meiosis are two processes by which eukaryotic cells may
divide and share several similarities:

-   They are both preceded by interphase (which includes DNA
    replication)
-   They both divide according to a common pathway
    (prophaseÂ â†’Â metaphaseÂ â†’Â anaphaseÂ â†’Â telophase)
-   They both split their cells via cytokinesis

However there are certain key differences which distinguish the two
processes:

-   DivisionÂ â€“ Mitosis involves only one cell division, but meiosis
    requires two cell divisions
-   Independent assortmentÂ â€“ Homologous pairs are randomly separated
    into separate cells in meiosis, but not mitosis
-   SynapsisÂ â€“ Homologous pairs form bivalents in meiosis, but not
    mitosis
-   Crossing overÂ â€“ Non-sister chromatids of homologous pairs may
    exchange genetic material in meiosis, but not mitosis
-   OutcomeÂ â€“ Mitosis results in the formation of two daughter cells,
    while meiosis produces four daughter cells
-   PloidyÂ â€“ Daughter cells produced by mitosis are diploid, while
    daughter cells produced by meiosis are haploid
-   UseÂ â€“ Mitosis is used to clone body cells, while meiosis is used
    to generate sex cells (gametes)
-   GeneticsÂ â€“ Cells produced by mitosis are genetically identical
    (clones), while cells produced by meiosis are genetically distinct

Mnemonic:Â Â Disco Pug

Mitosis versus Meiosis

Comparison of Meiotic and Mitotic Processes

[]
Mendel and Meiosis

Gregor Mendel was a 19th century Moravian monk who demonstrated that the
inheritance of traits (i.e. genes) follow particular laws:

-   Law of Segregation: Â Each hereditary characteristic is controlled
    by two alleles which separate into different gametes
-   Law of Independent Assortment: Â The separation of alleles for one
    gene is independent to allele separation for another gene
-   Principle of Dominance: Â In pairs of alleles that are different,
    one allele will mask the effect of the other allele

TheseÂ â€˜lawsâ€™Â are now known to be due to key events that occur
during meiotic division:

-   The law of segregation describes how homologous chromosomes (and
    hence allele pairs) are separated in meiosis I
-   The law of independent assortment describes how homologous pairs
    align randomly (as bivalents) during metaphase I

Through the elucidation of the process of meiosis, we now know that
there are certain exceptions to Mendelâ€™s laws:

-   Genes that are on the same chromosome (linked genes) will not
    undergo independent assortment (unless recombination occurs)
-   Not all genes display a dominance hierarchy â€“ certain traits may
    display codominance or incomplete dominance

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Independent assortment of genes is due to the random orientation
of pairs of homologous chromosomesÂ 

Â  Â  in meiosis I

Â  Â Â 
Independent assortment describes how pairs of alleles separate
independently from one another during gamete formation

-   According to independent assortment, the inheritance of one
    gene/trait is independent to the inheritance of any other gene/trait
-   Independent assortment is due to the random orientation of pairs of
    homologous chromosomes in meiosis I

DuringÂ metaphase I, homologous chromosomes line up at the equator as
bivalents in one of two arrangements:

-   Maternal copy left / paternal copy rightÂ Â ORÂ Â paternal copy left
    / maternal copy right

The orientation of each homologous pair isÂ random and is notÂ affected
by the orientation of any other homologous pair

-   This means an allele on one chromosome has an equal chance of being
    paired with, or separated from, any allele on another chromosome
    (their inheritance is independent of one another)

Independent assortment will not occur if two genes are located on the
same chromosome (linked genes)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I

â€¢ Â Sister chromatids separate in meiosis II

Â  Â Â 
Meiosis consists of two divisions, both of which follow the same stages
as mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)

-   Meiosis is preceded byÂ interphase, in which DNA is replicated to
    produce chromosomes consisting of two sister chromatids
-   A second growth phase calledÂ interkinesisÂ may occur between
    meiosis I and II, however no DNA replication occurs in this stage

Meiosis I

The first meiotic division is a reduction
divisionÂ (diploidÂ â†’Â haploid)Â in which homologous chromosomes are
separatedÂ 

-   P-I:Â Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, homologous
    chromosomes form bivalents, crossing over occurs
-   M-I:Â Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes connect to bivalents
    (at centromeres) and align them along the middle of the cell
-   A-I:Â Spindle fibres contract and split the bivalent, homologous
    chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell
-   T-I:Â Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membraneÂ mayÂ reform, cell
    divides (cytokinesis) to form two haploid daughter cells

Meiosis II

The second division separates sister chromatids (these chromatids may
not be identical due to crossing over in prophase I)Â 

-   P-II:Â Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, centrosomes
    move to opposite poles (perpendicular to before)
-   M-II:Â Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes attach to
    chromosomes (at centromere) and align them along the cell equator
-   A-II:Â Spindle fibres contract and separate the sister chromatids,
    chromatids (now called chromosomes) move to opposite poles
-   T-II:Â Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membrane reforms, cells
    divide (cytokinesis) to form four haploid daughter cellsÂ 

The final outcome of meiosis is the production of four haploid daughter
cells

-   These cells may all be genetically distinct if crossing over occurs
    in prophase I (causes recombination of sister chromatids)

Animation of the Stages of Meiosis

[stages-of-meiosis]
Stages of Prophase

Most of the events that function to differentiate meiosis from mitosis
occur inÂ Prophase I

-   Homologous chromosomes form bivalents (or tetrads) and crossing over
    occurs between non-sister chromatids

Prophase I is divided into 5 distinctive sub-stages:

-   Leptotene â€“ The chromosomes begin to condense and are attached to
    the nuclear membrane via their telomeres
-   Zygotene â€“ Synapsis begins with a synaptonemal complex forming
    between homologous chromosomes
-   Pachytene â€“ Crossing over of genetic material occurs between
    non-sister chromatids
-   Diplotene â€“ Synapsis ends with disappearance of synaptonemal
    complex; homologous pairs remain attached at chiasmata
-   Diakinesis â€“ Chromosomes become fully condensed and
    nuclearÂ membrane disintegrates prior to metaphase I

Stages of Prophase I

[prophase one]
Centimorgan

A centimorgan is a unit of measure used to approximate the distance
between genes

-   Thomas Morgan demonstrated that genes that were further apart on a
    chromosome were more likely to recombine
-   This is because there are more potential sites for crossing over to
    occur between distant genes

One centimorgan (or genetic map unit / m. u.) is the equivalent to a
recombination frequency of 1%

-   A centimorgan is not a true measure of distance and will differ in
    equivalence between species
-   In humans, 1 cM corresponds to approximately 1 million bp on average

While centimorgans may still be used to quantitate recombination
frequencies, they are no longer used to measure distance

-   Genome mapping has allowed scientists to determine specific
    distances between genes inÂ kilo bases (kb)

Chi Squared Table

A chi-squared table shows the distribution of critical values according
to each degree of freedom

-   This allows for an assessment to be made as to whether the data is
    statistically significant (p<0.05) or not

For accurate data, the following conditions should be met:

-   All items in the group should be independent and collected on a
    random basis
-   No group should contain very few items (e.g. less than 10)
-   The total number of items should be large (e.g. more than 50)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chi-squared tests are used to determine whether the difference
between an observed and expected frequencyÂ 

Â  Â  distribution is statistically significant

Â  Â Â 
It is possible to infer whether two genes are linked or unlinked by
looking at the frequency distribution of potential phenotypes

Offspring with unlinked genes have an equal possibility of inheriting
any potential phenotypic combination

-   This is due to the random segregation of alleles via independent
    assortment

Offspring with linked genes will only express the phenotypic
combinations present in either parent unless crossing over occurs

-   Consequently, theÂ â€˜unlinkedâ€™Â recombinant phenotypes occur less
    frequently than theÂ â€˜linkedâ€™Â parental phenotypes

Frequency Distribution of Unlinked and Linked Genes

[frequency distribution]

Chi-Squared Tests

Chi-squared tests are a statistical measure that are used to determine
whether the difference between an observed and expected frequency
distribution is statistically significant
If observed frequencies do not conform to those expected for an unlinked
dihybrid cross, this suggests that either:

-   Genes are linked and hence not independently assorted
-   The inheritance of the traits are not random, but are potentially
    being affected by natural selection

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of a chi-squared test on data from dihybrid crosses

Â  Â Â 
A chi-squared test can be applied to data generated from a dihybrid
cross to determine if there is a statistical correlation between
observed and expected frequencies

A chi-squared test can be completed by following five simple steps:

-   Identify hypotheses (null versus alternative)
-   Construct a table of frequencies (observed versus expected)
-   Apply the chi-squared formula
-   Determine the degree of freedom (df)
-   Identify the p value (should be <0.05)

Example of Chi-Squared Test Application

The trait for smooth peas (R) is dominant over wrinkled peas (r) and
yellow pea colour (Y) is dominant to green (y)

A dihybrid cross between two heterozygous pea plants is performed
(RrYyÂ Ã—Â RrYy)

The following phenotypic frequencies are observed:

-   701 smooth yellow peas Â ; Â 204 smooth green peas Â ; Â 243
    wrinkled yellow peas Â ; Â 68 wrinkled green peasÂ 

[chi squared one]

Step 1: Â Identify hypotheses

A chi-squared test seeks to distinguish between two distinct
possibilities and hence requires two contrasting hypotheses:

-   Null hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference between
    observed and expected frequencies (i.e. genes are unlinked)
-   Alternative hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference
    between observed and expected frequencies (i.e. genes are linked)

Step 2: Â Construct a table of frequencies

A table must be constructed that compares observed and expected
frequencies for each possible phenotype

-   Expected frequencies are calculated by first determining the
    expected ratios and then multiplying against the observed total

[chi squared two]

Step 3: Â Apply the chi-squared formula

The formula used to calculate a statistical value for the chi-squared
test is as follows:

[Screen Shot 2015-09-22 at 8.45.48 pm]

Where: Â âˆ‘Â = Sum Â ; Â O = Observed frequency Â ; Â E = Expected
frequency
These calculations can be broken down for each phenotype and added to
the table to make the final summation easier

[chi squared three]

Based on these results the statistical value calculated by the
chi-squared test is as follows:

-   ð??Œ²Â  = Â (0.42 + 2.53 + 0.99 + 0.84) Â = Â 4.76

Step 4: Â Determine the degree of freedom (df)

In order to determine if the chi-squared value is statistically
significant a degree of freedom must first be identified

-   The degree of freedom is a mathematical restriction that designates
    what range of values fall within each significance levelÂ 

The degree of freedom is calculated from the table of frequencies
according to the following formula:

df = (m â€“ 1) (n â€“ 1)Â 

Where: Â m = number of rows Â ; Â n = number of columns
For all dihybrid crosses, the degree of freedom should be: (number of
phenotypes â€“ 1)

-   In this particular instance, the degree of freedom is 3

Step 5: Â Identify the p value

The final step is to apply the value generated to a chi-squared
distribution table to determine if results are statistically significant

-   A value is considered significant if there is less than a 5%
    probability (p < 0.05) the results are attributable to chance

[chi squared four]

When df = 3, a value of greater than 7.815 is required for results to be
considered statistically significant (p < 0.05)

-   A value of 4.76 lies between p values of 0.25 and 0.1, meaning there
    is a 10 â€“ 25% probability results are caused by chance
-   Hence, the difference between observed and expected frequencies are
    not statistically significant

As results are not statistically significant, the alternative hypothesis
is rejected and the null hypothesis accepted:

-   Null hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference between
    observed and expected frequencies (genes are unlinked)

Practice Question

[question] In sweet pea plants, the trait for purple flowers (P) is
dominant to the trait for red flowers (p).
Similarly, the trait for long pollen (L) is dominant to the trait for
round pollen (l).
Two heterozygotes are crossed, yielding the following frequencies for
the F1 generation:
296 purple, long plants ; 19 purple, round plants ; 27 red, long plants
; 85 red, round plants
Activity: Use the chi-squared test to determine if these results are due
to independent assortment.

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Unlinked genes segregate independently as a result of meiosis

Â  Â Â 
According to the law of independent assortment, pairs of alleles are
inherited independently of one another if their gene loci are on
separate chromosomes â€“ these genes are said to be unlinked

-   This is due to the random orientation ofÂ homologous pairs during
    metaphase I of meiosis

The independent segregation of unlinked genes results in a greater
number of potential gamete combinations, as well as a greater variety of
possible phenotypes

-   This also results in more complex inheritance patterns (e.g.
    monohybrid versus dihybrid crosses)

Inheritance of a Single Gene versus Two Unlinked Genes

[unlinked gametes]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Completion and analysis of Punnett squares for dihybrid traits

Â  Â Â 
A dihybrid cross determines the genotypic and phenotypic combinations of
offspring for two particular genes that are unlinked

-   Because there are two genes, each with two alleles, there can be up
    to four different gamete combinations

The easiest way to work out potential gamete combinations in a dihybrid
cross is to use the FOIL method:

-   FOIL = First / Outside / Inside / Last

[FOIL method]

If you are having difficulty remembering the FOIL method, an alternative
way to identify potential gamete combinations in a dihybrid cross is to
remember the claw

The CLAW â€“ Calculating Dihybrid Gamete Combinations

[the claw]

How to Complete a Dihybrid Cross

The inheritance of dihybrid traits can be calculated according to the
following steps:
Step 1: Â Designate characters to represent the alleles

-   Capital letter for dominant allele, lower case letter for recessive
    allele

Step 2: Â Write down the genotype and phenotype of the parents (P
generation)

-   Always pair alleles from the same gene and always write capitals
    first (e.g. AaBb, not ABab)

Step 3: Â Write down all potential gamete combinations for both parents

-   Use the FOIL method (or the claw) to identify all possible
    combinations

Step 4: Â Use a Punnett square to work out potential genotypes of
offspring

-   Only include the different gamete combinations for each parent (e.g.
    AaBB has two combinations = AB and aB)

Step 5: Â Write out the phenotype ratios of potential offspring

-   Phenotypic ratios reflect mathematical probabilities only and may
    not necessarily reflect actual offspring ratios

10.2 Â Inheritance

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Genes may be linked or unlinked Â 
and are inherited accordingly

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Gene loci are said to be linked if on the same chromosome
-   Unlinked genes segregate independently as a result of meiosis
-   Variation can be discrete or continuous
-   The phenotypes of polygenic characteristics tend to show continuous
    variation
-   Chi-squared tests are used to determine whether the difference
    between an observed and expected frequency distribution is
    statistically significant

Applications:

-   Morganâ€™s discovery of non-Mendelian ratios in Drosophila
-   Completion and analysis of Punnett squares for dihybrid traits
-   Polygenic traits such as human height may also be influenced by
    environmental factors

Skills:

-   Calculation of the predicted genotypic and phenotypic ratio of
    offspring of dihybrid crosses involving unlinked autosomal genes

Linked Genes

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gene loci are said to be linked if on the same chromosome

Â  Â Â 
A linkage group is a group of genes whose loci are on the same
chromosome and hence donâ€™t independently assort

-   Linked genes will tend to be inherited together and hence donâ€™t
    follow normal Mendelian inheritance for a dihybrid cross
-   Instead the phenotypic ratio will be more closely aligned to a
    monohybrid cross as the two genes are inherited as a single unit
-   Linked genes may become separated via recombination (due to crossing
    over during synapsis in meiosis I)

[linkage symbols]

Unlinked versus Linked Inheritance Patterns

[unlinked vs linked]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Morganâ€™s discovery of non-Mendelian ratios in Drosophila

Â  Â Â 
Thomas Hunt Morgan provided a key contribution to our current
understanding of gene linkage by discovering non-Mendelian ratios in
Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies)

-   His breeding experiments involving fruit flies clearly demonstrated
    that linked genes were not independently assorted

Sex Linkage

When cross-breeding red-eyed wild types with white-eyed mutants, he
discovered a clear sex bias in phenotypic distribution

-   All female offspring of a red-eyed male were red-eyed, whereas all
    male offspring of a white-eyed female were also white-eyed
-   Morgan described this distribution as 'sex-limitedâ€™Â inheritance
    and inferred it was caused by the gene for eye colour being located
    on a sex chromosome (i.e. X-linked)

Morgan's Discovery of Sex Linkage in Drosophila

[sex linked flies]

Gene Linkage

Morgan went on to identify a number of different traits in fruit flies
that did not conform to Mendelian ratios

-   Certain phenotypic combinations occurred in much lower frequencies
    than was to be expected

Based on this data, Morgan made two key proposals:

-   The alleles for these traits were located on a shared chromosome
    (gene linkage) and hence did not independently assort
-   Linked alleles could be uncoupled via recombination (crossing over)
    to create alternative phenotypic combinations, but these new
    phenotypes would occur at a much lower frequency

Morgan also observed that the amount of crossing over between linked
genes differed depending on the combination of traits

-   This led to the idea that crossover frequency may be a product of
    the distance between two genes on a chromosome â€“Â genes with a
    higher crossover frequency are further apart, whereas genes with a
    lower crossover frequency are closer together
-   Morgan used this concept to develop the first gene linkage maps that
    showed the relative positions of genes on a chromosome

Gene Linkage and Recombination Frequencies

[]
      Crossover Site:                 None                 One
                 Two                  Three                  Four

From the above diagrams it can be seen that:Â 

-   LongÂ aristae and red eyes are more likely to be separated via
    recombination (high crossover frequency)
-   Long aristae and long legs are less likely to be separated via
    recombination (low crossover frequency)Â 

This indicates that the aristae and leg genes are located closer
together, whereas the eye gene is more distant

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Variation can be discrete or continuous

â€¢ Â The phenotypes of polygenic characteristics tend to show
continuous variation

Â  Â Â 
Variation in phenotypes for a particular characteristic can be either
discrete (discontinuous) or continuous

-   Monogenic traits (characteristics controlled by a single gene loci)
    tend to exhibit discrete variation, with individuals expressing one
    of a number of distinct phenotypes
-   Polygenic traits (characteristics controlled by more than two gene
    loci) tend to exhibit continuous variation, with an individualâ€™s
    phenotype existing somewhere along a continuous spectrum of
    potential phenotypes

In the case of polygenic inheritance:

-   Increasing the number of loci responsible for a particular trait
    increases the number of possible phenotypesÂ 
-   This results in a phenotypic distribution that follows a Gaussian
    (bell-shaped) normal distribution curve

MonogenicÂ â†’Â Polygenic Inheritance

[polygenic]

Maize Grain Colour

An example of a polygenic trait is grain colour in maize (wheat), which
is controlled by three gene loci

-   Grain colour can range from white to dark red, depending on the
    amount of pigment that is expressed

Each gene has two alleles, which either code for red pigment or white
pigment

-   The most frequent combinations have an equal number of the two
    allele types
-   Conversely, combinations of one extreme or the other are relatively
    rare
-   The overall pattern of inheritance shows continuous variation

Continuous Variation in Maize Grain Colour

[continuous variation]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Polygenic traits such as human height may also be influenced by
environmental factors

Â  Â Â 
Phenotypic characteristics are not solely determined by genotype, but
are also influenced by environmental factors

-   The added effect of environmental pressures functions to increase
    the variation seen for a particular trait

One example of a polygenic trait that is influenced by environmental
factors is human height

-   Human height is controlled by multiple genes (polygenic), resulting
    in a bell-shaped spectrum of potential phenotypes
-   Environmental factors such as diet and health (disease) can further
    influence an individual humanâ€™s height

Another example of a polygenic trait that is influenced by environmental
factors is human skin colour

-   Skin colour is controlled by multiple melanin producing genes, but
    is also affected by factors such as sun exposureÂ

Recombinants

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of recombinants in crosses involving two linked
genes

Â  Â Â 
Recombinants of linked genes are those combinations of genes not found
in the parents

-   Recombinants occur as a result of crossing over of genetic material
    during prophase I of meiosis
-   If linked genes become separated by a chiasma, there will be an
    exchange of alleles between the non-sister chromatids
-   This creates new allele combinations that are different to those of
    the parent

Identifying Recombinants from Genotype

[recombinant genotype]

The frequency of recombinant phenotypes within a population will
typically be lower than that ofÂ non-recombinant phenotypes

-   This is because crossing over is a random process and chiasmata do
    not form at the same locations with every meiotic division

The relative frequency of recombinant phenotypes will be dependent on
the distance between linked genes Â 

-   Recombination frequency between two linked genes will be greater
    when the genes are further apart on the chromosomeÂ 
-   This is because there are more possible locations where a chiasma
    could form between the genes

Recombinant phenotypes can be identified by performing a test cross
(crossing with a homozygous recessive for both traits)

Identifying Recombinants from Phenotype

[recombinant phenotype]
Test Cross

A test cross involves mating an unknown genotypic individual with a
known homozygous recessive

-   This is because recessive alleles will always be masked by the
    presence of dominant alleles
-   Hence the phenotype of any offspring will reflect the genotype of
    the unknown parent

Testing an Unknown Dominant Phenotype

Test crosses can be used to determine whether a dominant phenotype is
homozygous or heterozygous

-   If the unknown parent is homozygous dominant, all offspring will
    express the dominant phenotype
-   If the unknown parent is heterozygous, half the offspring should be
    dominant and half recessive

[test cross 1]

Testing for Gene Linkage

Test crosses can also be used to determine if two genes are linked or
unlinked by mating with a known heterozygote

-   If there is an equal ratio of the four potential phenotypes, the two
    genes are likely unlinked (independent assortment)
-   If there are two phenotypes in high amounts and two phenotypes in
    low amounts (recombinants), the two genes are likely linked
-   A chi-squared test for association can be used to determine the
    statistical likelihood of each scenario

[test cross 2]

Test crosses require large numbers of offspring to produce reliable data
for meaningful conclusions

-   With the advent of genetic screening and genome mapping, test
    crosses have become less commonly used

Skill:

â€¢ Â Comparison of allele frequencies of geographically isolated
populations

Â  Â Â 
Genetic drift is the change in the composition of a gene pool as a
result of chance or random events

-   It will occur faster and be more significant in smaller populations,
    where chance events have a bigger impact on the gene pool
-   Larger populations will be less affected by random events and
    maintain more stable allele frequencies with low genetic drift

Allele frequencies will change significantly when a large population is
reduced to a small population

-   Two mechanisms by which this population change may occur are via
    population bottlenecks and the founder effect

Population Bottlenecks

Population bottlenecks occur when an event reduces population size by an
order of magnitude (~ >50%)

-   These bottlenecks may result from natural occurrences (e.g. fires,
    floods, etc.) or be human induced (e.g. overhunting)
-   The surviving population has less genetic variability than before
    and will be subject to a higher level of genetic drift
-   As the surviving members begin to repopulate, the newly developing
    gene pool will be divergent to the original
-   Example:Â  Northern elephant seals have reduced genetic diversity
    compared with southern seals due to overhunting

Population Bottleneck â€“ Gene Pool Comparison

[population bottleneck]

Founder Effect

The founder effect occurs when a small group breaks away from a larger
population to colonise a new territory

-   As this population subset does not have the same degree of diversity
    as a larger population, it is subject to more genetic drift
-   Consequently, as this new colony increases in size, its gene pool
    will no longer be representative of the original gene pool
-   The founder effect differs from population bottlenecks in that the
    original population remains largely intact
-   Example: Â Certain Amish communities have a higher incidence of
    polydactyly because of inter-marriage within the community

Founder Effect â€“ Gene Pool Comparison

[founder effect]

Allele Frequency Comparisons

Allele frequencies represent the prevalence of a particular allele in a
population, as a proportion of all the alleles for that gene

-   Consequently, allele frequencies are either represented as a
    percentage or as a value from 0 to 1.0

Changes in allele frequency can reflect either random processes (genetic
drift) or differential processes (natural selection)

-   Population bottlenecks and the founder effect will exacerbate
    genetic differences between geographically isolated populations

Allele frequencies between populations can be compared using the Allele
Frequency Database (ALFRED)

[Alfred link]

[alfred]

How to Compare Allele Frequencies:

1.Â Â Go to the Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED)

2.Â Â Type a gene name into the search parameter

3.Â Â Choose a specific gene loci

4.Â Â Select a polymorphism

5.Â Â Choose a frequency display format

Examples:

-   SCL45A2 â€“ involved in human melanin production (allele frequency
    differs in Northern Europe)
-   ABO â€“ blood groups show regional variation (e.g. O blood more
    common in Africa)
-   LCT â€“ lactase is required for lactose tolerance (more common in
    Northern Europe / Africa)

Please Note:
SCL45 is one of a number of genes contributing to melanin production and
the pigmentation of human skin
A particular allele responsible for lighter pigmentation is more
frequent in Northern Europe
Allopolyploidy

Polyploidy is a condition in which an organism has more than two
complete sets of chromosomes in every cell (i.e. > diploid)

-   Autopolyploidy occurs when a polyploid offspring is derived from a
    single parental species (usually via self fertilisation)
-   Allopolyploidy occurs when a polyploid offspring is derived from two
    distinct parental species

Allopolyploidy

-   Normally different species cannot interbreed because they have
    different chromosome numbers and cannot form diploid pairsÂ 
-   Offsprings produced by such unions are typically sterile due to this
    uneven chromosome pairing
-   If cytokinesis fails to occur in one of the gametes, the hybrid
    offspring will have paired chromosomes from that parent species
-   If the hybrid interbreeds with a member of the other parent species,
    all chromosomes from both parent species will be paired
-   The resulting offspring will now be fertile and have the combined
    chromosome composition of both parental species

Allopolyploids are more prevalent than autopolyploids as they do not
show polysomic inheritance and have better fertility rates

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A gene pool consists of all the genes and their different alleles,
present in an interbreeding population

Â  Â Â 
Gene Pools

A gene pool represents the sum total of alleles for all genes present in
a sexually reproducing population

-   A large gene pool indicates high amounts of genetic diversity,
    increasing the chances of biological fitness and survival
-   A small gene pool indicates low amounts of genetic diversity,
    reducing biological fitness and increasing chances of extinction

Gene pools can be used to determine allele frequency â€“ the proportion
of a particular allele within a population

Representation of a Gene Pool

[gene pool]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evolution requires that allele frequencies change with time in
populations

Â  Â Â 
Evolution is the cumulative change in the heritable characteristics of a
population across successive generations

-   This requires that allele frequencies change within the gene pool of
    the population to reflect these evolving characteristics

Mechanisms of Change

Changes to allele frequency within a gene pool (evolution) can result
from five key processes:

-   Mutation: Â A random change in the genetic composition of an
    organism due to changes in the DNA base sequence
-   Gene flow: Â The movement of alleles into, or out of, a population
    as a result of immigration or emigration
-   Sexual reproduction: Â Sex can introduce new gene combinations and
    alter allele frequencies if mating isÂ assortative
-   Genetic drift: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as a
    result of a chance or random event
-   Natural selection: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as
    a result of differentially selective environmental pressures

Extinction

Extinction is the total cessation of a species or higher taxon level,
reducing biodiversity

-   It can result gradually, as one population of organisms
    progressively evolve into something else (phyletic extinction)
-   Alternatively, a species may not leave any
    identifiableÂ descendentsÂ and simply cease to exist (abrupt
    extinction)

Extinction can be caused by a range of factors, including habitat
degradation, predation, disease or natural disaster

-   Over 99% of species that have ever existed on Earth are now extinct

Mass extinction events are categorised by an unusually high number of
species dying out in a relatively short period

-   There have been five commonly recognised mass extinction events in
    the history of the Earth

Mass Extinction Events

1. Ordovicianâ€“Silurian mass extinction (~450 million years ago):
Approximately 60 â€“ 70% of all species wiped out

2. Late Devonian mass extinction (~370 million years ago): Over 75% of
all species wiped out

3. Permian mass extinction (~250 million years ago): Roughly 96% of all
species were wiped out

4. Triassic mass extinction (~200 million years ago): Over 50% of all
species were wiped out

5. Cretaceous mass extinction (~65 million years ago): Approximately 80%
of all species wiped out

Hardy-Weinberg Principle

The Hardy-Weinberg equation is a means by which the frequency of two
alternate alleles can be predicted within a population
For two alleles of a given genetic characteristic, three genotypes are
possible (assuming Mendelian inheritance): AA, Aa and aa

-   Dominant allele is A, with a frequency of p
-   Recessive allele is a, with a frequency of q

The Hardy-Weinberg Equation
â€¢ Â The total frequency of both alleles will be 100% â€“ in other
words: Â p + q = 1
â€¢ Â Because genotypes consist of two alleles, this equation must be
squared: Â ( p + q ) ²Â  = Â 1
â€¢ Â This gives the expanded Hardy-Weinberg equation: Â p² + 2pq + q² =
Â 1 Â Â (whereby p²Â = AA ; 2pq = Aa ; q²Â = aa)Â 

Graphical Representation of the Hardy-Weinberg Principle

[hardy weinberg equation]

Hardy-Weinberg Conditions

For the Hardy-Weinberg equation to be accurate, certain population
conditions are assumed:

-   The population is largeÂ with random mating
-   There is no mutation or gene flow
-   There is no natural selection or allele-specific mortality

Worked Example

Suppose we had a population of 500 people, in which 9% were albino
(albinism is a recessive characteristic)

-   How many individuals in this population are heterozygous?

Using the equations: Â  Â p + q = Â 1 Â  Â and Â  Â p²Â + 2pq + q²Â =
Â 1

-   If q²Â = 0.09 Â  â‡’ Â  q = 0.3 Â (âˆš 0.09)
-   If q = 0.3 Â Â â‡’ Â  p = 0.7 Â (p + 0.3 = 1)
-   If p = 0.7 Â Â â‡’ Â Â p²Â = 0.49 Â  (0.7²)
-   2pq = 0.42 Â Â â‡’ Â  (0.49 + 2pq + 0.09 = 1)Â 

Substituting these numbers for frequencies and applying them to the
original population shows that:

-   49% of people are homozygous dominant (AA), which is 245 individuals
    (0.49Â Ã— 500)
-   9% of people are homozygous recessive (aa), which is 45 individuals
    (0.09Â Ã— 500)
-   42% of people are heterozygous (Aa), which is 210 individuals
    (0.42Â Ã— 500)

Practice Question

[question] In cats, the trait for black fur (B) is dominant to white fur
(b).
In a population of 250 cats, there are 40 cats with white fur.
What is the relative frequencies of the two alleles (B and b) within the
population?
How many of the cats with black fur are heterozygous for this
characteristic?
Remember:        p + q = 1      AND      p² + 2pq + q² = 1

    present in an interbreeding population
-   Evolution requires that allele frequencies change with time in
    populations

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Reproductive isolation of populations can be temporal, behavioural
or geographic

Â  Â Â 
Reproductive isolation occurs when barriers prevent two populations from
interbreeding â€“ keeping their gene pools separate

There are two main categories of reproductive isolation barriers:

-   Prezygotic isolation â€“ occurs before fertilisation can occur (no
    offspring are produced)
-   Postzygotic isolation â€“ occurs after fertilisation (offspring are
    either not viable or infertile)

Prezygotic isolation barriers can be temporal, behavioural, geographic /
ecological or mechanical; whereas postzygotic isolation barriers include
the inviability, infertility or breakdown of hybrid organisms

Reproductive Isolation Mechanisms

[reproductive isolation]

Temporal Isolation

-   Temporal isolation occurs when two populations differ in their
    periods of activity or reproductive cycles
-   Example: Â Leopard frogs and wood frogs reach sexual maturity at
    different times in the spring and hence cannot interbreed

Behavioural Isolation

-   Behavioural isolation occurs when two populations exhibit different
    specific courtship patterns
-   Example: Â Certain populations of crickets may be morphologically
    identical but only respond toÂ specific mating songs

Geographic Isolation

-   Geographic isolation occurs when two populations occupy different
    habitats or separate niches within a common region
-   Example: Â Lions and tigers occupy different habitats and do not
    interbreed (usually)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Speciation can occur abruptly

Â  Â Â 
Evolution occurs both within a species (microevolution) and across the
species barrier (macroevolution = speciation)

-   Evolution viaÂ speciation may occur by one of two alternative
    models: phyletic gradualism or punctuated equilibrium

Phyletic Gradualism

According to this model, speciation generally occurs uniformly, via the
steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages

-   In this view, speciation is seen as a smooth and continuous process
    (big changes result from many cumulative small changes)
-   This view is supported by the fossil record of the horse, with many
    intermediate forms connecting the ancestral species to the modern
    equivalent

[phyletic gradualism]

Punctuated Equilibrium

According to this model, species remain stable for long periods before
undergoing abrupt and rapid change (speciation)Â 

-   In this view, speciation is seen as a periodic process (big changes
    occur suddenly, followed by long periods of no change)
-   This view is supported by the general lack of transitional fossils
    for most species â€“ however such absences could also be explained
    by the relatively rare and irregular conditions required for
    fossilisation

[punctuated equilibrium]

Pace of Evolution

[pace of evolution]
Polymorphisms

A polymorphism is the occurrence of two or more clearly different
phenotypes within the same population of a species

-   Whereas alleles are the individual components of a gene,
    polymorphisms are the individual components of a traits
-   Consequently, polymorphisms reflect the involvement of more than one
    allele for any given gene in the gene pool

Transient Polymorphisms

Occurs when there are two alleles in the gene pool and one allele is
gradually replacing the other

This is due to a strong environmental pressure causing directional
selection to eliminate one allele from the gene pool

Example: Â Light vs dark melanic variants of the peppered moth
(direction of selection determined by environment)

Transient Polymorphism â€“ Melanism in Peppered Moths

[transient polymorphism]

Balanced Polymorphisms

Occurs when there are two alleles in the gene pool and the frequency of
the two alleles is not changing

This is due to selective pressures promoting the coexistence of two
alleles (heterozygous advantage) via stabilising selection

Example: Â Sickle cell anaemia in African nations (heterozygotes do not
develop anaemia but have resistance to malaria)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Speciation due to divergence of isolated populations can be
gradual

Â  Â Â 
Speciation is an evolutionary process that results in the formation of a
new species from a pre-existing species

-   It occurs when reproductive isolating mechanisms prevent two
    breeding organisms from producing fertile, viable offspring

There are two basic mechanisms via which speciation can occur:

-   Allopatric speciation (geographical isolation)
-   Sympatric speciation (reproductive isolation)Â 

Allopatric Speciation

Allopatric speciation occurs when a geographical barrier physically
isolates populations of an ancestral species

-   The two populations begin to evolve separately as a result of
    cumulative mutation, genetic drift and natural selection
-   Eventually the two populations reach a degree of genetic divergence
    whereby they can no longer interbreed (speciation)

Sympatric Speciation

Sympatric speciation is divergence of species within the same
geographical location (i.e. without a physical barrier)

-   Sympatric speciation may result from the reproductive isolation of
    two populations as a result of genetic abnormalities
-   Typically, a chromosomal error may arise which prevents successful
    reproduction with any organism lacking the same error

Allopatric versus Sympatric Speciation

[types of speciation]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Speciation in the genus Allium by polyploidy

Â  Â Â 
Sympatric speciation is most commonly caused as the result of a meiotic
failure during gamete formation

-   If meiotic cells fail to undergo cytokinesis, chromosomal number
    will double in the gamete (e.g. diploid instead of haploid)
-   This will result in offspring that have additional sets of
    chromosomes (polyploidy)
-   Speciation will result if the polyploid offspring are viable and
    fertile but cannot interbreed with the original parent population

Polyploidy

[autopolyploidy]

Fertile polyploid offspring will typically require two polyploid parents
(unless allopolyploidy occurs)

-   This is because reproduction with the original parent population
    results in offspring with an uneven number of chromosome sets
-   Example:Â  diploid gamete + haploid gamete = infertile triploid
    zygote (cannot halve an uneven number when forming gametes)

Consequently, polyploidy is far more common in plant species as they may
lack separate sexes or can reproduce asexually

-   Self-pollination â€“ many plant species possess both male and female
    reproductive parts (monoecious) and can hence self fertilise
-   Asexual reproduction â€“ infertile polyploids can still reproduce
    asexually via vegetative propagation

Polyploid crops may be particularly desirable to farmers for a number of
reasons:

-   Allows for the production of seedless fruits (e.g. triploid
    watermelons are infertile and hence do not produce seeds)
-   Polyploid crops will typically grow larger and demonstrate improved
    longevity and disease resistance (hybrid vigour)

Consequently, farmers may induce polyploidy in certain plant species by
treating plants with certain drugs (e.g.Â colchicine)

Hybrid Vigour in Polyploids as a Result of Increased Gene Dosage

[hybrid vigour]

Speciation in Allium

The genus Allium is comprised of monocotyledonous flowering plants and
includes onions, garlic, chives and leeks

-   In many of these species polyploidy has occurred, resulting in
    reproductively isolated populations with distinct phenotypes

Examples of polyploidy in Allium species includes:

-   Diploid (2n) = ~ 16 chromosomes (e.g. Allium cepa â€“ garden onion)
-   Triploid (3n) = ~ 24 chromosomes (e.g. Allium carinatum â€“ keeled
    garlic)
-   Tetraploid (4n) = ~ 32 chromosomes (e.g. Allium tuberosum â€“
    chinese chives)
-   Pentaploid (5n) = ~ 40 chromosomes (e.g. Allium oleraceum â€“ field
    garlic)
-   Octoploid (8n) = ~ 66 chromosomes (e.g. Allium nutans â€“ blue
    chives)
Species Caveats

A species is a population, or group of populations, whose members have
the potential to interbreed to produce fertile, viable offspring

-   Members of a species are unable to produce fertile, viable offspring
    with members of a different species
-   Hybrids are infertile offspring produced from cross-breeding between
    two different species (e.g. mules, ligers, etc.)

There are a number of caveats to the traditional definition of a
species, including:

-   Certain organisms do not reproduce sexually (e.g. bacteria) but can
    transfer genetic material via plasmid exchange
-   Some past organisms are known only through fossils, with no living
    representatives, so breeding capacity is unestablished
-   Geographically isolated populations may never come into physical
    contact, meaning breeding capacity is unestablished
-   It may be physically impossible for certain members of the same
    species to interbreed (e.g. certain dog breeds)
-   Some species spread around an area to form interlinked populations,
    whereby the populationÂ â€˜endsâ€™Â cannot interbreed (ring species)

Types of Selection

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Identifying examples of directional, stabilising and disruptive
selection

Â  Â Â 
Natural selection is the change in the composition of a gene pool in
response to a differentially selective environmental pressure

-   The frequency of one particular phenotype in relation to another
    will be a product of the type of selection that is occurring

Stabilising Selection

-   Where an intermediate phenotype is favoured at the expense of both
    phenotypic extremes
-   This results in the removal of extreme phenotypes (phenotypic
    distribution becomes centrally clustered to reflect homogeneity)
-   Operates when environmental conditions are stable and competition is
    low
-   An example of stabilising selection is human birth weights (too
    large = birthing complications ; too small = risk of infant
    mortality)

Directional Selection

-   Where one phenotypic extreme is selected at the cost of the other
    phenotypic extreme
-   This causes the phenotypic distribution to clearly shift in one
    direction (towards the beneficial extreme)
-   Operates in response to gradual or sustained changes in
    environmental conditions
-   Directional selection will typically be followed by stabilising
    selection once an optimal phenotype has been normalised
-   An example of directional selection is the development of antibiotic
    resistance in bacterial populations

Disruptive Selection

-   Where both phenotypic extremes are favoured at the expense of the
    intermediate phenotypic ranges
-   This causes the phenotypic distribution to deviate from the centre
    and results in a bimodal spread
-   This occurs when fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g. seasons)
    favour the presence of two different phenotypes
-   Continued separation of phenotypic variants may eventually split the
    population into two distinct sub-populations (speciation)
-   An example of disruptive selection is the proliferation of black or
    white moths in regions ofÂ sharply contrasting colour extremes

Understanding:

â€¢ Â White blood cells release histamine in response to allergens

Â  Â Â 
An allergen is an environmental substance that triggers an immune
response despite not being intrinsically harmful

-   This immune response tends to be localised to the region of exposure
    (e.g. airways and throat) as an allergic reaction
-   A severe systemic allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis and can be
    fatal if left untreatedÂ 

An allergic reaction requires a pre-sensitised immune state (i.e. prior
exposure to the allergen)

-   When a specific B cell first encounters the allergen, it
    differentiates into plasma cells and makes large quantities of
    antibody (IgE)
-   The IgE antibodies attach to mast cells, effectivelyÂ â€˜primingâ€™
    them towards the allergen
-   Upon re-exposure to the allergen, the IgE-primed mast cells release
    large amounts of histamine which causes inflammation

Stages of an Allergic Reaction

[allergic reaction]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Histamine causes allergic symptoms

Â  Â Â 
The release of histamine from IgE-primed mast cells causes an
inflammatory response that results in allergic symptoms

-   Inflammation improves leukocytes mobility to infected regions by
    triggering vasodilation and increasing capillary permeability

Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels to improve the circulation
of blood to targeted regions

-   Vasodilation causes redness (as vessel expansion moves blood closer
    to the skin) and heat (which is transported in blood)

Capillary permeability describes the capacity for leukocytes to leave
the bloodstream and migrate into the body tissueÂ 

-   Increased permeability leads to swelling (more fluid leaks from the
    blood) and pain (swelling causes compression of nerves)

Redness, heat, swelling and localised pain are all typical symptoms of
an allergic response

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plasma cells secrete antibodies

â€¢ Â Antibodies aid in the destruction of pathogens

Â  Â Â 
When a specific B lymphocyte is activated following antigen
presentation, it divides into plasma cells and memory cells

-   Plasma cells are short-lived and secrete high numbers of antibodies
    that are specific to a particular antigen
-   Plasma cells will secrete ~ 2,000 antibody molecules per second into
    the bloodstream for roughly 4 to 5 days

Antibodies aid in the destruction of pathogens by a number of different
mechanisms:

[panic]

â€¢ Â Precipitation â€“ Soluble pathogens become insoluble and
precipitateÂ 

â€¢ Â Agglutination â€“ Cellular pathogens become clumped for easier
Â removalÂ 

â€¢ Â Neutralisation â€“ Antibodies may occlude pathogenic regions (e.g.
exotoxins)

â€¢ Â Inflammation â€“ Antibodies may trigger an inflammatory response
within the body

â€¢ Â Complement activation â€“ Complement proteins perforate membranes
(cell lysis)
Mnemonic: Â PANIC

Collectively, the action of antibodies enhance the immune system by
aiding the detection and removal of pathogens by the phagocytic
leukocytes of the innate immune system (macrophages)

-   The constant region of antibodies can be recognised by macrophages,
    improving pathogen identification (opsonisation)
-   The macrophages can now engulf and eliminate pathogens more
    efficiently, reducing disease symptoms

Understanding:

â€¢ Â B lymphocytes are activated by T lymphocytes in mammals

â€¢ Â Activated B cells multiply to form clones of plasma cells and
memory cells

Â  Â Â 
When the body is challenged by a foreign pathogen it will respond with
both a non-specific and a specific immune reaction

-   Non-specific immune cells called macrophages will engulf pathogens
    non-selectively and break them down internally
-   A proportion of macrophages (dendritic cells) will present the
    antigenic fragments of the pathogen to specific lymphocytesÂ 

The body contains millions of different T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes
that each recognise a single, specific antigen

-   Antigenic fragments are presented to specific helper T lymphocytes
    (T_(H)Â cells) that, when activated, releases cytokines
-   The cytokines stimulate a specific B cell that produces antibodies
    to the antigen toÂ divide and form clones (clonal selection)
-   Most of the clones will develop into short-lived plasma cells that
    produce large quantities of specific antibody
-   A small proportion of clones will differentiate into long-lived
    memory cells that function to provide long-term immunity

Pathogens typically contain multiple distinct antigenic fragments on
their surface and hence a single pathogen is likely to stimulate several
different T and B lymphocytes to produce a variety of specific
antibodies (polyclonal activation)

Immune Disorders

The purpose of the immune system is to maintain normal health, and hence
an abnormal immune response may cause disease

-   The immune system may over-react (hypersensitivity), fail to
    distinguishÂ â€˜selfâ€™ andÂ â€˜non-selfâ€™ (autoimmune conditions)
    or cease working entirely (immunodeficiency)

Hypersensitivity Disorders

Hypersensitivity refers to an excessively disproportionate immune
response to a substance that is not inherently harmful (allergen)

-   Such reactions require a pre-sensitised immune state (prior
    exposure), with an excessive reaction occurring upon re-exposure
-   Allergic reactions are examples of localised hypersensitivity
    conditions, while anaphylaxis is a more severe, systemic example

Autoimmune Disorders

Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system fails to recognise body cells
asÂ â€˜selfâ€™ and begins targeting its own cells and tissues

-   Some pathogens try to evade immune detection by producing antigens
    that closely resemble host markers (antigenic mimicry)
-   Detection of these pathogens will lead to the production of
    antibodies that will recognise and target markers on body cells
-   Examples of autoimmune diseases include diabetes (type I),
    rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis

Immunodeficiency Disorders

Immunodeficiency is a state in which the immune systemâ€™s capacity to
fight infection is compromised or absent entirely

-   These disorders may be inherited (e.g. SCIDs), pathogenic in origin
    (e.g. AIDS) or caused by drug treatments
-   Cytotoxic drugs which cause immunosuppression are commonly used
    during transplant operations to avoid graft rejection

Immune System Disorders Analogy

[immune disorders]
Immune Pathways

The adaptive immune system is comprised of two interrelated immune
pathways â€“Â humoral and cell-mediated immunity

-   Both pathways involve elements of the innate immune system to
    coordinate their respective immune reactions

Humoral Immunity

Humoral immunity describes the pathway by which antibodies are produced
by B lymphocytes to target exogenous antigens

-   When macrophages engulf exogenous pathogens, they digest them within
    lysosomes to release antigenic fragments
-   These fragments are presented on special surface receptors (MHC
    class II) that denote the material as being foreign
-   The antigens are presented to helper T cells, which in turn secrete
    cytokines to activate the appropriate B lymphocytes
-   The specific B lymphocytes divide and differentiate (clonal
    selection) to form antibody producing plasma cells

Cell-mediated Immunity

Cell-mediated immunity describes a pathway that does not result in
antigen production but instead targets endogenous antigens

-   Cancerous and virus-infected cells involve the bodyâ€™s own cells
    and thus are not recognised as foreign, evading normal detection
-   These cells may instead present antigenic fragments as a complex
    with their own self markers (MHC class I)
-   When helper T cells identify these cells, they stimulate a second
    type of T lymphocyte â€“ cytotoxic T cells (T_(C) cells)
-   Cytotoxic T cells show specificity to particular antigens and will
    bind to the presented antigen and release perforating enzymes
-   These enzymes cause the infected / cancerous cell to by lysed,
    preventing the further spread of infection
-   Virus infected cells can also be destroyed non-specifically by NK
    cells, which respond to interferon released by the infected cell

Summary of Adaptive Immune Pathways

[immune pathways]
Immunity

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Immunity depends on the persistance of memory cells

Â  Â Â 
The adaptive immune system relies on the clonal expansion of plasma
cells to produce sufficiently large numbers of antibodies

-   This means there is a delay between the initial exposure to a
    pathogen and the production of large quantities of antibodies
-   If pathogens can reproduce rapidly during this delay period, they
    can impede normal body functioning and cause disease

Memory cells are produced to prevent this delay in subsequent exposures
and hence prevent disease symptoms developing

-   When a B lymphocyte is activated and divides to form plasma cells, a
    small proportion will differentiate into memory cells
-   Memory cells are long living and will survive in the body for many
    years, producing low levels of circulating antibodies
-   If a second infection with the same pathogen occurs, memory cells
    will react more vigorously to produce antibodies faster
-   As antibodies are produced faster, the pathogen cannot reproduce in
    sufficient amounts to cause disease symptoms
-   Hence, because pathogen exposure no longer causes the disease to
    occur, the individual is said to be immune

Immunological Memory

[immunological memory]
Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system is a secondary transport system that protects and
maintains the body by producing and filtering lymph

-   Lymph is a clear fluid that contains white blood cells and arises
    from the drainage of fluid from the blood and surrounding tissues
-   Lymph is filtered at points called lymph nodes, where pathogens are
    removed before the fluid is returned to venous circulation

In addition to its key immune function, the lymphatic system also
absorbs fats from the gut and extra fluids from all over the body

-   In this respect, the lymphatic system plays an important role in
    lipid transport and maintaining a viable blood pressure

Major lymphatic organs include the spleen, tonsils, thymus and adenoids

â€¢ Â Monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybridoma cells

Â  Â Â 
Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies artificially derived from a single
B cell clone (i.e. identical specific antibodies)

-   An animal (typically a mouse) is injected with an antigen and
    produces antigen-specific plasma cells
-   The plasma cells are removed and fused (hybridised) with tumor cells
    capable of endless divisions (immortal cell line)
-   The resulting hybridoma cell is capable of synthesising large
    quantities of monoclonal antibody

Production of Monoclonal Antibodies

[monoclonal antibodies]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Monoclonal antibodies to hCG are used in pregnancy test kits

Â  Â Â 
Monoclonal antibodies can be used for both the therapeutic treatment and
clinical detection of disease

-   An example of therapeutic use involves the use of antibodies in the
    treatment of rabies
-   An example of diagnostic use involves the use of antibodies in the
    detection of pregnancy

Treatment Use

Monoclonal antibodies are commonly used to provide immune protection for
individuals who contract harmful diseases

-   Because the rabies virus can potentially be fatal, injecting
    purified antibodies functions as an effective emergency treatment
-   Monoclonal antibodies can be used to target cancer cells that the
    bodyâ€™s own immune cells fail to recognise as harmful

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are named according to the source
organism from which the antibodies were derived

-   Mice antibodies ('-omabâ€™) are easier to synthesise than human
    antibodies but are less likely to be tolerated by the patient

Examples of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies

[monoclonal therapy]

Diagnostic Use

Monoclonal antibodies can be used to test for pregnancy via the presence
of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in urine

-   hCG is a hormone produced by women during foetal development and
    thus its presence in urine is indicative of pregnancy

Pregnancy tests use a process called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) to identify a substance via a colour change

-   Free monoclonal antibodies specific to hCG are conjugated to an
    enzyme that changes the colour of a dye
-   A second set of monoclonal antibodies specific to hCG are
    immobilised to the dye substrate
-   If hCG is present in urine, it will interact with both sets of
    monoclonal antibody (forming an antibodyÂ â€˜sandwichâ€™)
-   When both sets of antibody are bound to hCG, the enzyme is brought
    into physicial proximity with the dye, changing its colour
-   A third set of monoclonal antibodies will bind any unattached
    enzyme-linked antibodies, functioning as a control

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Pathogens can be species-specific although others can cross
species barriers

Â  Â Â 
A pathogen is an agent that causes disease â€“ either a microorganism
(bacteria, protist, fungi or parasite), virus or prion

-   A disease is any condition that disturbs the normal functioning of
    the body (i.e. the body can no longer maintain homeostasis)
-   An illness is a deterioration in the normal state of health of an
    organism (a disease may cause an illness)

Pathogens are generally species-specific in that their capacity to cause
disease (pathogenesis) is limited to a particular species

-   Polio, syphilis, measles andÂ gonorrhoea are examples of diseases
    caused by pathogens that specifically affect human hostsÂ 

Certain pathogens may cross the species barrier and be able to infect
and cause disease in a range of hosts

-   Diseases from animals that can be transmitted to humans are called
    zoonotic diseases (or zoonoses)
-   Examples of zoonotic diseases include rabies (dogs), certain strains
    of influenza (e.g. bird flu) and the bubonic plague (rats)

Zoonosis

[zoonoses]

Disease Transmission

Transmission of infectious diseases can occur via a number of distinct
mechanisms:

-   Direct contact â€“ the transfer of pathogens via physical
    association or the exchange of body fluids
-   Contamination â€“ ingestion of pathogens growing on, or in, edible
    food sources
-   Airborne â€“ certain pathogens can be transferred in the air via
    coughing and sneezing
-   Vectors â€“ intermediary organisms that transfer pathogens without
    developing disease symptoms themselves

Methods of Disease Transmission

Self versus Non-Self

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Every organism has unique molecules on the surface of its cells

Â  Â Â 
The immune system has the capacity to distinguish between body cells
(â€˜selfâ€™) and foreign materials (â€˜non-selfâ€™)

-   It will react to the presence of foreign materials with an immune
    response that eliminates the intruding material from the body

All nucleated cells of the body possess unique and distinctive surface
molecules that identify it as self

-   These self markers are called major histocompatibility complex
    molecules (MHC class I) and function as identification tags
-   The immune system will not normally react to cells bearing these
    genetically determined markers (self-tolerance)

Any substance that is recognised as foreign and is capable of triggering
an immune response is called an antigen (non self)

-   Antigens are recognised by lymphocytes which bind to and detect the
    characteristic shape of an exposed portion (epitope)
-   Lymphocytes trigger antibody production (adaptive immunity) which
    specifically bind to epitopes via complementary paratopes

Antigenic determinants include:Â 

-   Surface markers present on foreign bodies in the blood and tissue
    â€“ inluding bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic markers
-   The self markers of cells from a different organism (this is why
    transplantation often results in graft rejection)
-   Even proteins from food may be rejected unless they are first broken
    down into component parts by the digestive system

Self vs Non-Self

[self vs non-self]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Antigens on the surface of red blood cells stimulate antibody
production in a person with a different blood groupÂ 

Â  Â Â 
Self markers (MHC class I) are present on the surface of all nucleated
body cells and identify the cell as part of the organism

-   Different organisms have distinct self markers which prevent
    transplantation of tissues (unless a very close genetic match)

Red blood cells are not nucleated and hence do not possess the same
distinctive and unique self markers as all other body cells

-   This means that red blood cells can be transferred between
    individuals without automatically causing immune rejection

However, red blood cells do possess basic antigenic markers which limit
the capacity for transfusion (the ABO blood system)

-   Red blood cells may possess surface glycoproteins (A and B antigens)
    either independently (A or B) or in combination (AB)
-   Alternatively, red blood cells may possess neither surface
    glycoprotein (denoted as O)

As humans produce antibodies against foreign antigens, blood
transfusions are not compatible between certain blood groups

-   AB blood groups can receive blood from any other type (as they
    already possess both antigenic variants on their cells)
-   A blood groups cannot receive B blood or AB blood (as the B
    isoantigen is foreign and will stimulate antibody production)
-   B blood groups cannot receive A blood or AB blood (as the A
    isoantigen is foreign and will stimulate antibody production)
-   O blood groups can only receive transfusions from other O blood
    donor (both antigenic variants are foreign)

An additional glycoprotein (Rhesus factor) is either present or absent,
resulting in positive and negative blood groups

Types of Immunity

Immunity can be described as either active or passive, depending on how
it is acquired:

-   Active immunity involves the production of antibodies by the body
    itself and the subsequent development of memory cells
-   Passive immunity results from the acquisition of antibodies from
    another source and hence memory cells are not developed

Active immunity will result in long-term immunity but passive immunity
will not (due to the presence or absence of memory cells)Â 

-   Both active and passive immunity can be induced by either natural or
    artificial mechanisms

Examples of Active Immunity

-   Natural â€“ Producing antibodies in response to exposure to a
    pathogenic infection (i.e. challenge and response)
-   Artificial â€“ Producing antibodies in response to the controlled
    exposure to an attenuated pathogen (i.e. vaccination)Â 

Examples of Passive Immunity

-   Natural â€“ Receiving antibodies from another organism (e.g. to the
    foetus via the colostrum or a newborn via breast milk)
-   Artificial â€“ Receiving manufactured antibodies via external
    delivery (e.g blood transfusions of monoclonal antibodies)

Types of Immunity

Vaccination

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Vaccines contain antigens that trigger immunity but do not cause
the disease

Â  Â Â 
Vaccinations induce long-term immunity to specific pathogenic infections
by stimulating the production of memory cells

-   A vaccine is a weakened or attenuated form of the pathogen that
    contains antigens but is incapable of triggering disease
-   The antigenic determinants in a vaccine may be conjugated to an
    adjuvant, which functions to boost the immune response
-   The body responds to an injected vaccine by initiating a primary
    immune response, which results in memory cells being made
-   When exposed to the actual pathogen, the memory cells trigger a more
    potent secondary immune response
-   As a consequence of this more potent immune response, disease
    symptoms do not develop (individual is immune to pathogen)

The length of time a person is immune to infection following a
vaccination depends on how long the memory cells survive for

-   Memory cells may not survive a lifetime and individuals may
    subsequently require a booster shot to maintain immunity

Vaccination

[vaccination]

Herd Immunity

Vaccinations programmes are implemented to reduce the outbreak of
particular infectious diseases within populations

-   An epidemic is a substantially increased occurrence of a particular
    infection within a given region
-   A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread across a
    largeÂ geographical area (like a continent)

Vaccination confers immunity to vaccinated individuals but also
indirectly protects non-vaccinated individuals via herd immunity

-   Herd immunity is when individuals who are not immune to a pathogen
    are protected from exposure by the large amounts of immune
    individuals within the community

Application:

â€¢ Â Smallpox was the first infectious disease of humans to have been
eradicated by vaccination

Â  Â Â 
Smallpox was the first infectious disease of humans to have been
eradicated via vaccination

-   When a disease stops circulating in a region it is considered
    eliminated â€“ if it is eliminated worldwide, it is considered
    eradicated

Smallpox was targeted for eradication in 1967 by the World Health
Organisation (WHO), via a global vaccination programme

-   The last known case of smallpox in a civilian was registered in 1977
    and it was officially declared eradicated by WHO in 1980

The eradication of smallpox by vaccination was successful for a number
of reasons:

-   Smallpox was easily identifiable due to overt clinical symptoms,
    which helped to limit potential transmission
-   Transmission only occurred via direct contact and there were no
    animal vectors or reservoirs to sustain the infectious agent
-   The infection period was short lived (3 â€“ 4 weeks) and the virus
    was stable andÂ didnâ€™t mutate into alternate strains
-   There was global cooperation and immunity was long-term so repeated
    booster shots were unnecessary

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of epidemiological data related to vaccination programmes

Â  Â Â 
Vaccination programmes have lead to a reduction in the incidence of
infectious diseases in a number of regions

-   Different nations will implement different vaccination practices
    depending on the regional pathogenic threats

The World Health Organisation keeps a record of disease incidence and
immunisation schedules in different countries

-   These records are updated yearly and can be accessed at the
    following website: Â WHO Data and Statistics

Epidemiology is the study of the patterns, causes and effects of health
and disease conditions in a defined population

-   It can be used to compare the incidence of a disease over time
    (prior and following vaccination programme implementation)
-   It can be used to compare the incidence of a disease in different
    regions (both with and without vaccination programmes)

Vaccination Data

The following resources can be used to generate data tables and graphs
relating to national vaccination programmes:

-   Reported Disease Incidence Time Series Â (Excel file)
-   Year of Introduction of Selected Vaccine Â (Excel file)

When analysing trends associated with this data it is important to
remember the following caveats:

-   Populations have increased year on year, which would be likely to
    increase the risk of potential outbreaks
-   Improvements to health care services, public sanitation and medical
    breakthroughs will also influence disease rates
-   Different regions may experience different levels of exposure to
    particular infections (due to climate and vector presence)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synovial joints allow certain movements but not others

Â  Â Â 
Synovial joints are capsules that surround the articulating surfaces of
two bones (i.e. where the bones connect)

-   Joints function to maintain structural stability by allowing certain
    movements but not others

Synovial joints consist of three main components:

-   Joint capsule â€“ Seals the joint space and provides stability by
    restricting the range of possible movements
-   Cartilage â€“ Lines the bone surface to facilitate smoother
    movement, as well as absorbing shock and distributing load
-   Synovial fluid â€“ Provides oxygen and nutrition to the cartilage,
    as well as lubrication (reduces friction)

There are six main types of synovial joints that allow for different
ranges of movement, which are (in order of mobility):

-   Plane joints (least mobility), hinge joints, pivot joints, condyloid
    joints, saddle joints, ball and socket joints (most mobility)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Calcium ions and the proteins tropomyosin and troponin control
muscle contractions

Â  Â Â 
The process of muscular contraction occurs over a number of key steps,
including:

-   Depolarisation and calcium ion release
-   Actin and myosin cross-bridge formationÂ 
-   Sliding mechanism of actin and myosin filaments
-   Sarcomere shortening (muscle contraction)

1. Â Depolarisation and Calcium Ion Release

-   An action potential from a motor neuron triggers the release of
    acetylcholine into the motor end plate
-   Acetylcholine initiates depolarisation within the sarcolemma, which
    is spread through the muscle fibre via T tubulesÂ 
-   Depolarisation causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release stores
    of calcium ions (Ca²⁺)
-   Calcium ions play a pivotal role in initiating muscular contractions

Muscle Innervation

2.Â Â Actin and Myosin Cross-Bridge Formation

-   On actin, the binding sites for the myosin heads are covered by a
    blocking complex (troponin and tropomyosin)
-   Calcium ions bind to troponin and reconfigure the complex, exposing
    the binding sites for the myosin heads
-   The myosin heads then form a cross-bridge with the actin filaments

The Role of Calcium in Cross-Bridge Formation

[troponin-tropomyosin]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The contraction of the skeletal muscle is achieved by the sliding
of actin and myosin filaments

â€¢ Â ATP hydrolysis and cross bridge formation are necessary for the
filaments to slide

Â  Â Â 
3. Â Sliding Mechanism of Actin and Myosin

-   ATP binds to the myosin head, breaking the cross-bridge between
    actin and myosin
-   ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to change position and
    swivel, moving them towards the next actin binding site
-   The myosin heads bind to the new actin sites and return to their
    original conformation
-   This reorientation drags the actin along the myosin in a sliding
    mechanism
-   The myosin heads move the actin filaments in a similar fashion to
    the way in which an oar propels a row boat

Sliding Filaments Mechanism

4. Â Sarcomere Shortening

-   The repeated reorientation of the myosin heads drags the actin
    filaments along the length of the myosin
-   As actin filaments are anchored to Z lines, the dragging of actin
    pulls the Z lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere
-   As the individual sarcomeres become shorter in length, the muscle
    fibres as a whole contracts

Diagrams of Sarcomere Shortening

[sarcomere contraction]

Summary of Muscle Contractions

-   Action potential in a motor neuron triggers the release of Ca²⁺ ions
    from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
-   Calcium ions bind to troponin (on actin) and cause tropomyosin to
    move, exposing binding sites for the myosin heads
-   The actin filaments and myosin heads form a cross-bridge that is
    broken by ATP
-   ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to swivel and change
    orientation
-   Swiveled myosin heads bind to the actin filament before returning to
    their original conformation (releasing ADP + Pi)
-   The repositioning of the myosin heads move the actin filaments
    towards the centre of the sarcomere
-   The sliding of actin along myosin therefore shortens the sarcomere,
    causing muscle contraction

Â  Â Â 
Organisation of Skeletal Muscles

-   Skeletal muscles consist of tightly packaged muscular bundles
    (fascicles) surrounded by connective tissue (perimysium)
-   Each bundle contains multiple muscle fibres, which are formed when
    individual muscle cells fuse together
-   Muscle fibres contain tubular myofibrils that run the length of the
    fibre and are responsible for muscular contraction
-   The myofibrils can be divided into repeating sections called
    sarcomeres, each of which represent a single contractile unitÂ 

Structural Arrangement of Skeletal Muscles

[muscle organisation]

Muscle Fibre Structure

Each individual muscle fibre has the following specialised features
designed to facilitate muscle contraction:

-   They areÂ multinucleate (fibres form from the fusion of individual
    muscle cells and hence have many nuclei)
-   They have a large number of mitochondria (muscle contraction
    requires ATP hydrolysis)
-   They have a specialised endoplasmic reticulum (it is called the
    sarcoplasmic reticulum and stores calcium ions)
-   They contain tubular myofibrils made up of two different
    myofilaments â€“ thin filament (actin) and thick filament (myosin)
-   The continuous membrane surrounding the muscle fibre is called the
    sarcolemma and contains invaginations called T tubules

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Movement of the body requires muscles to work in antagonistic
pairs

Â  Â Â 
Muscles connect to bones (via tendons) and contract to provide the force
required to produce movement

-   The muscle connects a static bone (point of origin) to a moving bone
    (point of insertion)

Skeletal muscles exist in antagonistic pairs (when one contracts, the
other relaxes) to enable opposing movementsÂ 

-   Opposing movements may include: flexion vs extension, abduction vs
    adduction, protraction vs retraction, etc.

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Antagonistic pairs of muscles in an insect leg

Â  Â Â 
Many types of insects (including grasshoppers and praying mantises) have
hind legs that are specialised for jumping

-   The jointed exoskeleton of the hind leg is divided into three parts:
    femur (upperÂ leg), tibia (middle leg) and tarsus (lower leg)
-   The femur and tibia are connected by two antagonistic muscles:
    flexor tibiae muscle and extensor tibiae muscle

When the flexor muscle contracts, the extensor muscle relaxes and the
tibia and femur are brought closer together

-   This retracts the hind quarters in preparation for pushing off the
    ground

When the extensor muscle contracts, theÂ flexor muscle relaxes and the
tibia is pushed away from the femur

-   This extends the hind quarters and causes the insect to jump

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Each myofibril is made up of contractile sarcomeres

Â  Â Â 
Myofibrils consist of repeating contractile units called sarcomeres,
which are made of two protein myofilaments

-   The thick filament (myosin) contains small protruding heads which
    bind to regions of the thin filament (actin)
-   Movement of these two filaments relative to one another causes the
    lengthening and shortening of the sarcomere

Each individual sarcomere is flanked by dense protein discs called Z
lines, which hold the myofilaments in place

-   The actin filaments radiate out from the Z discs and help to anchor
    the central myosin filaments in place

The recurring sarcomeres produce a striated (striped) pattern along the
length of the skeletal muscle fibres

-   The centre of the sarcomere appears darker due to the overlap of
    both actin and myosin filaments (A band)
-   The peripheries of the sarcomere appear lighter as only actin is
    present in this region (I band)
-   The dark A band may also contain a slightly lighter central region
    where only the myosin is present (H zone)

When drawing a diagram of a sarcomere it is important to remember the
following conventions:

-   The myosin filaments are the thick filaments and should be
    represented as being thicker than the actin filaments
-   The myosin filaments should include protruding heads (myosin heads
    form cross-bridge attachments with actin)
-   The striated banding pattern should be identified (A band = dark
    region ; I band = light region)

â€¢ Â Bones and exoskeletons provide anchorage for muscles and act as

Â  Â Â 
Movement Systems

The ability to move is controlled by a number of interacting body
systems, including:

-   Skeletal system â€“ consists of bones that act as levers and provide
    a structure for the muscles to pull
-   Muscular system â€“ muscles deliver the force required to move one
    bone in relation to another
-   Nervous system â€“ delivers signals to the muscles which cause them
    to contract and create movement

Body Systems Involved in Locomotion

[musculoskeletal]

Skeletal System

Skeletons are a rigid framework that function to provide support and
protection for body organs

-   Skeletons can be internal (endoskeletons) or external (exoskeletons)
    depending on the organism
-   Endoskeletons typically consist of numerous bones, while
    exoskeletons are comprised of connected segments

Skeletons provide a surface for muscle attachment and thus facilitate
the movement of an organism

-   Bones and exoskeletons act as levers, moving in response to muscular
    contraction
-   Bones are connected to other bones by ligaments, and bones are
    connected to muscles by tendonsÂ 

Endoskeletons versus Exoskeletons

[endo vs exoskeleton]
Slow vs Fast Twitch

There are two different types of skeletal muscle fibres that are used to
facilitate movement:
Slow Twitch Fibres

-   Slow twitch fibres are used for muscular endurance â€“ they contract
    slowly but do not fatigue easily
-   Slow twitch fibres use oxygen for aerobic respiration, have a large
    amount of mitochondria and many blood vessels
-   Slow twitch fibres are typically red in colour due to the dense
    supply of capillaries
-   Slow twitch fibres are prevalent in endurance athletes, such as
    marathon runners

Fast Twitch Fibres

-   Fast twitch fibres are used for muscular strength â€“ they contract
    rapidly but fatigue easily
-   Fast twitch fibres respire anaerobically and consequently possess
    less mitochondria and have fewer blood vessels
-   Fast twitch fibres are typically lighter in colour (white)
-   Fast twitch fibres are prevalent in strength athletes, such as
    sprinters

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of electron micrographs to find the state of contraction
of muscle fibres

Â  Â Â 
The arrangement of myofilaments within a sarcomere give a skeletal
muscle fibre a striated appearance

-   A sarcomere has a central darker region (A band) where actin and
    myosin filaments overlap
-   A sarcomere has peripheral lighter regions (I bands) where actin is
    present, but not myosin

When muscle fibres contract, actin filaments slide along the myosin,
reducing the length of the lighter I bands

-   The movement of the actin filaments also reduces the width of the H
    zone, however the length of A bands do not change

Types of Levers

Muscles and bones act together to achieve a variety of movement by
forming different types of levers

A lever consists of four main parts: lever arm, fulcrum, force and load

-   Bones function as the lever arm (structural framework of lever)
-   Joints function as the fulcrum (point on which the lever turns)
-   Muscles provide the force or effort required to move the lever
-   The load is typically the weight of the body part being moved

Levers can be categorised into different classes according to the
relative positions of the lever components

-   In first class levers, the fulcrum is between the load and the force
    (e.g. nodding the head)
-   In second class levers, the load is inbetween the fulcrum and the
    force (e.g. standing on tip toes)
-   In third class levers, the force is inbetween the fulcrum and the
    load (e.g. bending your arm)

Types of Levers in the Human Body

Types of Muscles

There are three main types of muscular tissue responsible for movement
within the human body:
Skeletal Muscle

-   Skeletal muscle is found attached to the skeleton and is responsible
    for the voluntary movement of bones
-   Skeletal muscle fibres run in parallel tracts and are multinucleated
    and heavily striated

Smooth Muscle

-   Smooth muscle is found in the lining of internal organs (GI tract,
    uterus, blood vessels, eyes, etc.)
-   It controls the involuntary constriction of these regions (e.g.
    peristalsis, vasoconstriction, pupil dilation)
-   Smooth muscle fibres are not striated, have a spindle shape and each
    fibre contains a single central nucleus

Cardiac Muscle

-   Cardiac muscle is found in the heart and is responsible for the
    rhythmic contraction of the heart (i.e. heart beat)
-   Cardiac muscle fibres are branching, intercalated, lightly striated
    Â and have a single nucleus per fibreÂ

â€¢ Â The type of nitrogenous waste in animals is correlated with
evolutionary history and habitat

Â  Â Â 
Excretion is the removal from the body of the waste products of
metabolic activity

-   Defecation is not considered part of excretion as faeces are
    undigested food remnants and not metabolic waste products

There are two key functions that an excretory system performs:

-   Removes nitrogenous wastes that may be toxic to the body in large
    concentrations
-   Removes excess water to maintain a suitable osmolarity within the
    tissues and cells

Removing Nitrogenous Waste

Nitrogenous wastes are produced from the breakdown of
nitrogen-containing compounds like amino acids and nucleotides

-   Nitrogenous wastes are toxic to the organism and hence excess levels
    must be eliminated from the body
-   The type of nitrogenous waste in animals is correlated with the
    evolutionary history of the animal and the habitat

Most aquatic animals eliminate their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia (NH₃)

-   Ammonia is highly toxic but also very water soluble and hence can be
    effectively flushed by animals in aquatic habitats

Terrestrial animals have less access to water and hence must package
nitrogenous waste in less toxic forms

-   Mammals eliminate their nitrogenous wastes as urea, which is less
    toxic and hence can be stored at higher concentrations
-   Reptiles and birds eliminate wastes as uric acid, which requires
    more energy to make but is relatively non-toxic and requires even
    less water to flush (it is eliminated as a semi-solid paste)

Nitrogenous Waste Products

Understanding:

â€¢ Â All animals are either osmoregulators or osmoconformers

Â  Â Â 
Removing Excess Water

Water levels within an organism are constantly changing as a result of
metabolic activity

-   Water is produced via condensation reactions (anabolism) and is
    consumed during hydrolysis reactions (catabolism)
-   The concentration of water within cells (osmolarity) will impact
    tissue viability (i.e. governs osmotic pressure within cells)

Animals may be either osmoconformers orÂ osmoregulators according to how
they manage their internal osmotic conditions:

-   Osmoconformers maintain internal conditions that are equal to the
    osmolarity of their environment
-   Osmoregulators keep their bodyâ€™s osmolarity constant, regardless
    of environmental conditions

By matching internal osmotic conditions to the environment,
osmoconformers minimise water movement in and out of cells

-   Less energy is used to maintain internal osmotic conditions within
    an osmoconformer

While osmoregulation is a more energy-intensive process, it ensures
internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled

-   Osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions whereas
    osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions

Application:

â€¢ Â Blood cells, glucose, proteins and drugs are detected in urinary
tests

Â  Â Â 
Kidney diseases are conditions which incapacitate the kidneyâ€™s ability
to filter waste products from the blood

-   Individuals with kidney diseases will demonstrate a reduced
    glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
-   If untreated, kidney diseases can lead to kidney failure â€“ which
    is life threatening

Urinary Analysis

Kidneys prevent the excretion of blood cells and proteins (during
ultrafiltration), as well as glucose (selective reabsorption)

-   Hence the presence of these materials in urine can be used as an
    indicator of disease

Glucose: Â The presence of glucose in urine is a common indicator of
diabetes (high blood glucose = incomplete reabsorption)

Proteins: Â High quantities of protein in urine may indicate disease
(e.g. PKU) or hormonal conditions (e.g. hCG = pregnancy)

Blood cells: Â The presence of blood in urine can indicate a variety of
diseases, including certain infections and cancer

Drugs / toxins: Â Many drugs pass through the body into urine and can be
detected (e.g. performance enhancing drugs)

Application:

â€¢ Â Treatment of kidney failure by hemodialysis or kidney transplant

Â  Â Â 
Hemodialysis

Kidney dialysis involves the external filtering of blood in order to
remove metabolic wastes in patients with kidney failureÂ 

Blood is removed and pumped through a dialyzer, which has two key
functions that are common to biological membranes:

-   It contains a porous membrane that isÂ semi-permeableÂ (restricts
    passage of certain materials)
-   It introduces fresh dialysis fluid and removes wastes to maintain an
    appropriateÂ concentration gradient

Kidney dialysis treatments typically last about 4 hours and occur 3
times a week â€“ these treatments can be effective for years

Overview of Kidney Dialysis

[kidney dialysis]

Kidney Transplant

Hemodialysis ensures continued blood filtering, but does not address the
underlying issue affecting kidney function

The best long-term treatment for kidney failure is a kidney transplant:

-   The transplanted kidney is grafted into the abdomen, with arteries,
    veins and ureter connected to the recipientâ€™s vessels
-   Donors must typically be a close genetic match in order to minimise
    the potential for graft rejection
-   Donors can survive with one kidney and so may commonly donate the
    second to relative suffering kidney failure

Â  Â Â 
The kidney functions as the bloodâ€™s filtration and water balancing
system â€“ it removes metabolic wastes for excretion

-   Blood enters the kidneys via the renal artery and exits the kidneys
    via the renal vein
-   Blood is filtered by specialised structures called nephrons which
    produce urine
-   The urine is transported from the kidneys via the ureter, where it
    is stored by the bladder prior to excretion

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The composition of blood in the renal artery is different from
that in the renal vein

Â  Â Â 
The kidney contains specialised structures called nephrons which
function to filter the blood and eliminate wastes

-   Consequently, the composition of blood entering the kidney (via
    renalÂ artery) differs to that exiting the kidney (via renal vein)

Blood in the renal vein (i.e. after the kidney) will have:

-   Less urea (large amounts of urea is removed via the nephrons to form
    urine)
-   Less water and solutes / ions (amount removed will depend on the
    hydration status of the individual)
-   Less glucose and oxygen (not eliminated, but used by the kidney to
    generate energy and fuel metabolic reactions)
-   More carbon dioxide (produced by the kidneys as a by-product of
    metabolic reactions)

Structural Organisation of the Kidneys

[kidney organisation]
Kidney Stones

A kidney stone (renal calculus) is a solid piece of material formed in
the kidneys from the minerals in urine

-   If a kidney stone grows to sufficient size it may block the ureter,
    decreasing kidney function and causing painful urination

In most cases, there is no known reason why a kidney stone forms,
however dehydration is a common contributing factor

-   Kidney stones may be prevented by limiting the dietary intake of
    minerals which form the stones (e.g. calcium)

One current treatment for kidney stones involves the use of ultrasounds
(shock wave lithotripsy)

-   Sound waves from outside the body are used to shatter the kidney
    stones into smaller fragments
-   Once disintegrated, the fragments of the kidney stone can be passed
    normally in the urine

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The Malpighian tubule system in insects and the kidney carry out
osmoregulation and the removal of

Â  Â Â nitrogenous wastes

Â  Â Â 
All animals possess a specialised excretory system for osmoregulation
and the removal of nitrogenous wastes

-   In mammals, the excretory system (kidneys) is separate from the
    digestive system of the animal
-   In insects, the excretory system (Malpighian tubules) connects to
    the digestive system of the animal

Malpighian Tubules

-   Insects have a circulating fluid system called hemolymph that is
    analogous to the blood system in mammals
-   Malpighian tubules branch off from the intestinal tract and actively
    uptake nitrogenous wastes and water from the hemolymph
-   The tubules pass these materials into the gut to combine with the
    digested food products
-   Solutes, water and salts are reabsorbed into the hemolymph at
    theÂ hindgut, whereas nitrogenous wastes (as uric acid) and
    undigested food materials are excreted via the anus

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of diagrams of the nephron

Â  Â Â 
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, with each nephron
being comprised of the following components:

-   Bowmanâ€™s capsule â€“ first part of the nephron where blood is
    initially filtered (to form filtrate)
-   Proximal convoluted tubule â€“ folded structure connected to the
    Bowmanâ€™s capsule where selective reabsorption occurs
-   Loop of Henle â€“ a selectively permeable loop that descends into
    the medulla and establishes a salt gradient
-   Distal convoluted tubule â€“ a folded structure connected to the
    loop of Henle where further selective reabsorption occurs

The blood to be filtered enters the Bowmanâ€™s capsule via an afferent
arteriole and leaves the capsule via an efferent arteriole

-   Within the Bowmanâ€™s capsule, the blood is filtered at a capillary
    tuft called the glomerulus
-   The efferent arteriole forms a blood network called the vasa recta
    that reabsorbs components of the filtrate from the nephron

Each nephron connects to a collecting duct (via the distal convoluted
tubule), which feed into the renal pelvis

-   The collecting ducts are shared by nephrons and hence are not
    technically considered to be part of a single nephron

Nephron Function

Nephrons filter blood and then reabsorb useful materials from the
filtrate before eliminating the remainder as urine

This process occurs over three key stages:

1.  Ultrafiltration â€“ Blood is filtered out of the glomerulus at the
    Bowmanâ€™s capsule to form filtrate
2.  Selective reabsorption â€“ Usable materials are reabsorbed in
    convoluted tubules (both proximal and distal)
3.  Osmoregulation â€“ The loop of Henle establishes a salt gradient,
    which draws water out of the collecting duct

Osmoregulation

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The loop of Henle maintains hypertonic conditions in the medulla

Â  Â Â 
Osmoregulation is the third of three processes by which blood is
filtered and urine is formed

-   Osmoregulation is the control of the water balance of the blood,
    tissue or cytoplasm of a living organism

Osmoregulation occurs in the medulla of the kidney and involves two key
events:

-   The loop of Henle establishes a salt gradient (hypertonicity) in the
    medulla
-   Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) regulates the level of water
    reabsorption in the collecting duct

Establishing a Salt Gradient

-   The function of the loop of Henle is to create a high solute
    (hypertonic) concentration in the tissue fluid of the medulla
-   The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water but
    not salts
-   The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to salts but
    not water
-   This means that as the loop descends into the medulla, the
    interstitial fluid becomes more salty and hypertonic
-   Additionally, the vasa recta blood network that surrounds the loop
    of Henle flows in the opposite direction (counter-current)
-   This means that salts released from the ascending limb are drawn
    down into the medulla, further establishing a salt gradient

Creating Hypertonicity in the Medulla

[loop of Henle]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â ADH controls reabsorption of water in the collecting duct

Â  Â Â 
Water Reabsorption

-   As the collecting duct passes through the medulla, the hypertonic
    conditions of the medulla will draw water out by osmosis
-   The amount of water released from the collecting ducts to be
    retained by the body is controlled by anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)
-   ADH is released from the posterior pituitary in response to
    dehydration (detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus)
-   ADH increases the permeability of the collecting duct to water, by
    upregulating production of aquaporins (water channels)
-   This means less water remains in the filtrate, urine becomes
    concentrated and the individual urinates less (i.e. anti-diuresis)
-   When an individual is suitably hydrated, ADH levels decrease and
    less water is reabsorbed (resulting in more dilute urine)
    -   Remember: Â ADH is produced when you Are DeHydrated

Role of ADH in Water Reabsorption

[ADH]
Renin

Renin is a hormone produced by the kidneys that regulates blood pressure
in response to changes in blood volume

-   When an individual is dehydrated, water levels in the blood plasma
    decrease â€“ leading to lower blood pressure
-   Renin is released from the kidney in response to low blood pressure
    and increases water reabsorption to raise blood volume

Renin is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) when the
kidneys detect a drop in blood pressure

-   Renin converts angiotensinogen (released from the liver) into
    angiotensin I
-   In the lungs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts
    angiotensin I into angiotensin II
-   Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, which functions to increase
    blood pressure by reducing the diameter of blood vessels
-   Angiotensin II also triggers the adrenal glands to release the
    hormone aldosterone
-   Aldosterone stimulates sodium uptake in the distal convoluted
    tubules
-   With more sodium reabsorbed into the bloodstream, more water is
    reabsorbed from the collecting ducts via osmosis
-   This functions to raise blood volume and hence increases blood
    pressure

Selective Reabsorption

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The proximal convoluted tubule selectively reabsorbs useful
substances by active transportÂ 

Â  Â Â 
Selective reabsorption is the second of the three processes by which
blood is filtered and urine is formed

-   It involves the reuptake of useful substances from the filtrate and
    occurs in the convoluted tubules (proximal and distal)
-   The majority of selective reabsorption occurs in the proximal
    convoluted tubule, which extends from the Bowmanâ€™s capsule

The proximal convoluted tubule has a microvilli cell lining to increase
the surface area for material absorption from the filtrate

-   The tubule is a single cell thick and connected by tight junctions,
    which function to create a thin tubular surface with no gaps

There are also a large number of mitochondria within these tubule cells,
as reabsorption involves active transport

-   Substances are actively transported across the apical membrane
    (membrane of tubule cells facing the tubular lumen)
-   Substances then passively diffuse across the basolateral membrane
    (membrane of tubule cells facing the blood)Â 

The tubules reabsorb all glucose, amino acids, vitamins and hormones,
along with most of the mineral ionsÂ (~80%)Â and water

-   Mineral ions and vitamins are actively transported by protein pumps
    and carrier proteins respectively
-   Glucose and amino acids are co-transported across the apical
    membrane with sodium (symport)
-   Water follows the movement of the mineral ions passively via osmosis

Ultrafiltration

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The ultrastructure of the glomerulus and Bowmanâ€™s capsule
facilitate ultrafiltration

Â  Â Â 
Ultrafiltration is the first of three processes by which metabolic
wastes are separated from the blood and urine is formed

-   It is the non-specific filtration of the blood under high pressure
    and occurs in the Bowmanâ€™s capsule of the nephron

Structure of the Bowmanâ€™s Capsule

-   As the blood moves into the kidney via afferent arterioles it enters
    a knot-like capillary tuft called a glomerulus
-   This glomerulus is encapsulated by the Bowmanâ€™s capsule, which is
    comprised of an inner surface of cells called podocytes
-   Podocytes have cellular extensions called pedicels that wrap around
    the blood vessels of the glomerulus
-   Between the podocytes and the glomerulus is a glycoprotein matrix
    called the basement membrane that filters the blood

[bowman's capsule]

Basement Membrane

Blood is filtered by a mesh called the basement membrane, which lies
between the glomerulus and Bowmanâ€™s capsule

-   Glomerular blood vessels are fenestrated (have pores) which means
    blood can freely exit the glomerulus
-   The podocytes of the Bowmanâ€™s capsule have gaps between their
    pedicels, allowing for fluid to move freely into the nephron
-   Consequently, the basement membrane functions as the sole filtration
    barrier within the nephron

The basement membrane is size-selective and restricts the passage of
blood cells and large proteins

-   Hence when the blood is filtered, the filtrate formed does not
    contain any blood cells, platelets or plasma proteins

[basement membrane]

Hydrostatic Pressure

Ultrafiltration involves blood being forced at high pressure against the
basement membrane, optimising filtration

-   This high hydrostatic pressure is created in the glomerulus by
    having a wide afferent arteriole and a narrow efferent arteriole
-   This means it is easy for blood to enter the glomerulus, but
    difficult for it to exit â€“ increasing pressure within the
    glomerulus
-   Additionally, the glomerulus forms extensive narrow branches, which
    increases the surface area available for filtration
-   The net pressure gradient within the glomerulus forces blood to move
    into the capsule space (forming filtrate)

Application:

â€¢ Â Consequences of dehydration andÂ overhydration

Â  Â Â 
Maintaining an appropriate water balance within the bodyâ€™s tissues and
cells is critical to the survival of an organism

-   Homeostasis cannot be maintained if water levels drop (dehydration)
    or are raised (overhydration) without regulation

Dehydration

-   Dehydration is a loss of water from the body such that body fluids
    become hypertonic
-   Individuals will experience thirst and excrete small quantities of
    heavily concentrated urine (to minimise water loss)
-   Blood pressure will drop (less water in plasma) and the heart rate
    will increase to compensate for this
-   The individual will become lethargic and experience an inability to
    lower body temperature (due to lack of sweat)
-   Severe cases of dehydration may cause seizures, brain damage and
    eventual death

Overhydration

-   Overhydration is a less common occurrence that results when an
    over-consumption of water makes body fluids hypotonic
-   Individuals will produce excessive quantities of clear urine in an
    effort to remove water from the body
-   The hypotonic body fluids will cause cells to swell (due to osmotic
    movement), which can lead to cell lysis and tissue damage
-   Overhydration can lead to headaches and disrupted nerve functions in
    mild cases (due to swelling of cells)
-   In severe cases, overhydration may lead to blurred vision, delirium,
    seizures, coma and eventual death

Effect of Water Balance on Erythrocyte Structure

[water balance]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The length of the loop of Henle is positively correlated with the
need for water conservation in animals

Â  Â Â 
All animals need to maintain an appropriate water balance, however the
need for water conservation will depend on habitat

-   Animals in arid, desert environments will need more efficient water
    conservation than animals in moist, mesic environments

Water conservation can be improved by having a longer loop of Henle,
which increase the salt gradient in the medulla

-   A greater the salt gradient in the medulla means more water is
    reabsorbed by the collecting ducts and urine is concentrated

Hence, the length of the loop of Henle is positively correlated with the
degree of water conservation in animals

-   Animals living in moist environments have short loops of Henle that
    donâ€™t descend deeply into the medulla (cortical nephrons)
-   Animals living in arid environments have long loops of Henle that
    descend deeply into the medulla (juxtamedullary nephrons)

Relationship between Environmental Conditions and Medullary Thickness

Amniotic Sac

The foetus develops in a fluid-filled space that is encased by an
amniotic sac

-   The amniotic sac separates the foetus from the mother and hence
    functions as a barrier against infection

The amniotic sac is filled with a protective liquid called amniotic
fluid, which serves a number of key roles:

-   The fluid is largely incompressible and good at absorbing pressure,
    and so protects the foetus from impacts to the uterus
-   The fluid also creates buoyancy so that the foetus does not have to
    support its own weight while a skeletal system develops
-   Finally, amniotic fluid prevents the dehydration of foetal tissues

The amniotic sac ruptures when a woman comes to term during labour â€“
this is known as herÂ â€˜waters breaking'

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fertilization in animals can be internal or external

Â  Â Â 
External Fertilization

-   External fertilization involves the fusion of gametes (egg and
    sperm) outside of the body of a parent
-   It is most common in aquatic animals, where the water acts as a
    medium via which the gametes can travel
-   This method of fertilization is susceptible to environmental
    influences, such as predators and pH changes
-   Consequently, species that reproduce this way usually release large
    quantities of gametes to compensate for losses
-   The process of releasing gametes into the water is called spawning

InternalÂ Fertilisation

-   Internal fertilization involves the fusion of gametes (egg and
    sperm) inside of the body of a parent
-   This requires a method by which the gamete of one parent can be
    introduced inside the body of another (e.g. copulation)
-   Terrestrial animals typically use internalÂ fertilization so as to
    prevent exposure and desiccation of gametes or embryos
-   Internal fertilization offers more protection to the gametes and
    embryos, but at a potential survival cost to the parentÂ

Birth Process

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Birth is mediated by positive feedback involving estrogen and
oxytocin

Â  Â Â 
The process of childbirth is called parturition and occurs via positive
feedback under hormonal control

Positive feedback involves a response thatÂ reinforcesÂ the change
detected (it functions toÂ amplifyÂ the change)

-   In the case of childbirth, fetal growth eventually causes stretching
    of the uterine walls, which is detected by stretch receptors
-   This triggers the release of hormones (oxytocin) that induce uterine
    muscles to contract, further reducing space in the womb
-   This causes more stretching and hence more contraction until the
    origin stimulus (the foetus) is removed (i.e. birth)

The Role of Positive Feedback in the Birth Process

[birth feedback]

Hormonal Control

The chemical regulators of the birthing process include
oxytocin,Â oestrogen, progesterone and prostaglandin

-   After 9 months, the baby is fully grown and stretches the walls of
    the uterus â€“ placing a strain on both mother and infant
-   This stress induces the release of chemicals which trigger a rise in
    the levels of estrogen (estriol in particular)
-   Estriol prepares the smooth muscle of the uterus for hormonal
    stimulation by increasing its sensitivity to oxytocin
-   Estriol also inhibits progesterone, which was preventing uterine
    contractions from occurring while the foetus developed
-   Now that the uterus is primed for childbirth, the brain triggers the
    release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland
-   Oxytocin stimulates the uterine muscles to contract, initiating the
    birthing process (it also inhibits progesterone secretion)
-   The foetus responds to this uterine contraction by releasing
    prostaglandins, which triggers further uterine contractions
-   As the uterine contractions trigger the release of chemicals that
    cause further contractions, a positive feedback loop ensues
-   Contractions will stop when labour is complete and the baby is
    birthed (no more stretching of the uterine wall)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of diagrams of mature sperm and egg to indicate
functions

Â  Â Â 
The male and female reproductive gametes (sperm and egg) have
specialised structures which reflect their functions

-   The male gamete (sperm) is small and motile and only contributes the
    maleâ€™s haploid nucleus to the zygote
-   The female gamete (egg) is large and non-motile and contributes all
    the organelles and cytoplasm to the zygote

Sperm

-   A typical human spermatozoa can be divided into three sections â€“
    head,Â mid-piece and tailÂ 
-   The head region contains three structures â€“ a haploid nucleus, an
    acrosome cap and paired centrioles
    -   The haploid nucleus contains the paternal DNA (this will combine
        with maternal DNA if fertilisation is successful)
    -   The acrosome cap contains hydrolytic enzymes which help the
        sperm to penetrate the jelly coat of the egg
    -   The centrioles are needed by a zygote in order to divide (egg
        cells expel their centrioles within their polar bodies)
-   TheÂ mid-piece contains high numbers of mitochondria which provide
    the energy (ATP) needed for the tail to move
-   The tail (flagellum) is composed of a microtubule structure called
    the axoneme, which bends to facilitate movement

Egg

-   A typical egg cell is surrounded by two distinct layers â€“
    theÂ zone pellucida (jelly coat) and coronaÂ radiata
    -   Â The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein matrix which acts as a
        barrier to sperm entry
    -   The corona radiata is an external layer of follicular cells
        which provide support and nourishment to the egg cell
-   Within the egg cell are numerous cortical granules, which release
    their contents upon fertilisation to prevent polyspermy
-   Although diagrams of egg cells commonly include a haploid nucleus,
    no nucleus will form within the egg until after fertilisation has
    occurred (the egg cell is arrested in metaphase II until it becomes
    fertilised by a sperm)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Implantation of the blastocyst in the endometrium is essential for
the continuation of pregnancy

Â  Â Â 
Blastocyst Formation

Following the fusion of an egg and sperm (fertilization), an influx of
Ca²⁺ into the ova prompts the completion of meiosis II

-   The egg and sperm nuclei combine to form a diploid nuclei and the
    fertilized cell is now called a zygote

The zygote will undergo several mitotic divisions to form a solid ball
of cells called a morula

-   As the morula continues to divide, it undergoes differentiation and
    cavitation (cavity formation) to form a blastocystÂ 

A blastocyst is comprised of three distinct sections:

-   An inner cell mass (that will develop into the embryo)
-   A surrounding outer layer called the trophoblast (this will develop
    into the placenta)
-   A fluid filled cavity called the blastocoeleÂ 

Early Embryo Development

Click to cycle between actual images and schematic representations

Implantation of Blastocyst

The final stage of early embryo development is the implantation of the
blastocyst into the endometrial lining of the uterus

-   The blastocyst breaches the jelly coat that was surrounding it and
    preventing its attachment to the endometrium
-   Digestive enzymes are released which degrade the endometrial lining,
    while autocrine hormones released from the blastocyst trigger its
    implantation into the uterine wall

Only once the blastocyst is embedded within the uterine wall can the
next stage of embryogenesis occur

-   The growing embryo will gain oxygen and nutrients from the
    endometrial tissue fluid, ensuring its continued development
-   The entire process (from fertilization to implantation) takes
    roughly 6 â€“ 8 days

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Spermatogenesis and oogenesis both involve mitosis, cell growth,
two divisions of meiosis and differentiation

Â  Â Â 
GametogenesisÂ is the process by which diploid precursor cells undergo
meiotic division to become haploid gametes (sex cells)

-   In males, this process is called spermatogenesis and produce
    spermatozoa (sperm)
-   In females, this process is called oogenesis and produce ova (eggs)

The process of gametogenesis occurs in the gonads and involves the
following steps:

-   Multiple mitotic divisions and cell growth of precursor germ cells
-   Two meiotic divisions (meiosis I and II) to produce haploid daughter
    cells
-   Differentiation of the haploid daughter cells to produce functional
    gametes

Spermatogenesis

-   Spermatogenesis describes the producton of spermatozoa (sperm) in
    the seminiferous tubules of the testes
-   The process begins at puberty when the germline epithelium of the
    seminiferous tubules divides by mitosis
-   These cells (spermatogonia) then undergo a period of cell growth,
    becoming spermatocytes
-   The spermatocytes undergo two meiotic divisions to form four haploid
    daughter cells (spermatids)
-   The spermatids then undertake a process of differentiation in order
    to become functional sperm cells (spermatozoa)

[spermatogenesis]

Oogenesis

-   Oogenesis describes the production of female gametes (ova) within
    the ovaries (and, to a lesser extent, the oviduct)
-   The process begins during foetal development, when a large number of
    primordial cells are formed by mitosis (~40,000)
-   These cells (oogonia) undergo cell growth until they are large
    enough to undergo meiosis (becoming primary oocytes)
-   The primary oocytes begin meiosis but are arrested in prophase I
    when granulosa cells surround them to form follicles
-   The primary oocytes remain arrested in prophase I until puberty,
    when a girl begins her menstrual cycle
-   Each month, hormones (FSH) will trigger the continued division of
    some of the primary oocytesÂ 
-   These cells will complete the first meiotic division to form two
    cells of unequal size
-   One cell retains the entirety of the cytoplasm to form a secondary
    oocyte, while the other cell forms a polar body
-   The polar body remains trapped within the follicle until it
    eventually degenerates
-   The secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division but is
    arrested in metaphase II
-   The secondary oocyte is released from the ovary (ovulation) and
    enters into the oviduct (or fallopian tube)
-   The follicular cells surrounding the oocyte form a coronaÂ radiata
    and function to nourish the secondary oocyte
-   If the oocyte is fertilised by a sperm, chemical changes will
    trigger the completion of meiosis II and the formation of another
    polar body (the first polar body may also undergo a second division
    to form a third polar body)
-   Once meiosis II is complete the mature egg forms a ovum, before
    fusing its nucleus with the sperm nucleus to form a zygote

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis result in different
numbers of gametes with different amounts

Â  Â of cytoplasm

Â  Â Â 
While the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis follow the same
basic pathway, several key differences exist:

1. Â Number of cells produced

-   In spermatogenesis, the cells divide equally during meiosis to
    produce four functional gametes
-   In oogenesis, the cells do not divide equally and as a result only
    one functional gamete is formed (plus 2 â€“ 3 polar bodies)

2. Â Size of cells produced

-   In spermatogenesis, the cells that are formed following
    differentiation are all of equal size with equal amounts of
    cytoplasm
-   In oogenesis, one daughter cell (the ovum) retains all of the
    cytoplasm, while the other daughter cells form polar bodies
-   The polar bodies remain trapped within the surrounding layer of
    follicle cells until they eventually degenerate

3. Â Timing of the process

-   In spermatogenesis, the production of gametes is a continuous
    process that begins at puberty and continues until death
-   In oogenesis, the production of gametes is a staggered and finite
    process:
    -   It begins before birth (prenatally) with the formation of a
        fixed number of primary oocytes (~40,000)
    -   It continues with the onset of puberty according to a monthly
        menstrual cycle
    -   It ends when hormonal changes prevent the further continuance of
        the menstrual cycle (menopause)

Application:

â€¢ Â The average 38 week pregnancy in humans can be positioned on a
graph showing the correlation between

Â  Â Â animal size and the development of the young at birth for other
mammals

Â  Â Â 
For mammals, theÂ gestation period is the time taken for a foetus to
develop â€“ beginning with fertilization and ending with birth

-   The duration of the gestation period will differ markedly between
    different species of animal

Generally, there are two main factors that contribute to the length of
the gestation period:

-   Animal size / mass â€“ larger animals tend to have longer gestation
    periods (as they tend to produce larger offspring)
-   The level of development at birth â€“ more developed infants will
    typically require a longer gestation period

The level of development at birth for mammalian infants can be described
as either atricial or precocial

-   Altricial mammals give birth to relatively helpless, undeveloped
    offspring that need extended rearing
-   Precocial mammals give birth to more developed offspring that are
    mobile and independent and require minimal rearing
-   Generally, altricial mammals (e.g. marsupials and rodents) require
    shorter gestation periods than precocial mammals (e.g. ungulates
    such as cows, pigs and rhinoceroses)

While the length of a gestation period does appear to positively
correlate with size and development, other factors also exist

-   Some mammal species may have similar gestation periods despite
    having significantly different body masses

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â hCG stimulates the ovary to secrete progesterone during early
pregnancy

Â  Â Â 
When a blastocyst becomes implanted in the endometrial lining it begins
to secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)

-   hCG promotes the maintenance of the corpusÂ luteum within the ovary
    and prevents its degeneration

As a consequence of this, the corpus luteum survives and continues to
produce both oestrogen and progesterone

-   Oestrogen inhibits FSH and LH production by the pituitary gland,
    preventing the release of more eggs from the ovaries
-   Progesterone also functions to maintain the endometrium (which is
    nourishing the embryo) and thicken the cervix

The levels of hCG are maintained for roughly 8 â€“ 10 weeks while the
placenta is being developed

-   After this time, the placenta becomes responsible for progesterone
    secretion and nourishing the embryo
-   At this point the corpus luteum is no longer required and begins to
    degenerate as hCG levels drop

Human Fertilization

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fertilization involves mechanisms that prevent polyspermy

Â  Â Â 
The process of fertilization in humans involves a number of key
processes, including:

-   Capacitation â€“ biochemical changes which occur post ejaculation to
    improve sperm motility
-   Acrosome reaction â€“ the release of hydrolytic enzymes which
    softens the zona pellucida (jelly coat)
-   Cortical reaction â€“ hardening of the jelly coat post fertilization
    to prevent potential polyspermy

1. Â Capacitation

Capacitation occurs after ejaculation, when chemicals released by the
uterus dissolve the spermâ€™s cholesterol coat

-   This improves sperm motility (hyperactivity), meaning sperm is more
    likely to reach the egg (in the oviduct)
-   It also destabilises the acrosome cap, which is necessary for the
    acrosome reaction to occur upon egg and sperm contact

Overview of Capacitation

[capacitation]

2. Â Acrosome Reaction

When the sperm reaches an egg, the acrosome reaction allows the sperm to
break through the surrounding jelly coat

-   The sperm pushes through the follicular cells of the corona radiata
    and binds to the zonaÂ pellucida (jelly coat)
-   The acrosome vesicle fuses with the jelly coat and releases
    digestive enzymes which soften the glycoprotein matrix
-   The sperm then pushes its way through the softened jelly coat and
    binds to exposed docking proteins on the egg membrane
-   The membrane of the egg and sperm then fuse and the sperm nucleus
    (and centriole) enters the egg

Overview ofÂ the Acrosome Reaction

[acrosome reaction]

3. Â Cortical Reaction

The cortical reaction occurs once a sperm has successfully penetrated an
egg in order to prevent polyspermy

-   Cortical granules within the eggâ€™s cytoplasm release enzymes (via
    exocytosis) into the zona pellucida (jelly coat)
-   These enzymes destroy sperm binding sites and also thicken and
    harden the glycoprotein matrix of the jelly coat
-   This prevents other sperm from being able to penetrate the egg
    (polyspermy), ensuring the zygote formed is diploidÂ

Placenta

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The placenta facilitates the exchange of materials between the
mother andÂ fetus

â€¢ Â Estrogen and progesterone are secreted by the placenta once it has
formed

Â  Â Â 
The placenta functions as the life support system for theÂ foetus,
serving two key functions:

-   It facilitates the exchange of materials between the mother
    andÂ foetus
-   It secretes hormones to maintain the pregnancy after the corpus
    luteum has degenerated

Structure of the Placenta

-   The placenta is a disc-shaped structure that nourishes the
    developing foetus
-   It is formed from the development of the trophoblast upon
    implantation and eventually invades the uterine wall
-   Maternal blood pools via open ended arterioles into intervillous
    spaces within the placenta called lacunae
-   Chorionic villi extend into these pools of blood and mediate the
    exchange of materials between the foetus and the mother
-   Exchanged material is transported from the villi to the foetus via
    an umbilical cord, which connects the foetus to the placenta
-   Upon birth, the placenta is expelled from the uterus with the infant
    â€“ it is then separated from the infant by severing the umbilical
    cord (the point of separation becomes the belly button)

Overview of the Structure of the Placenta

[placenta]

Material Exchange

-   The chorionic villi extend into the intervillous space (lacuna) and
    exchange materials between the mother and foetus
-   Chorionic villi are lined by microvilli to increase the available
    surface area for material exchange
-   Foetal capillaries within the chorionic villi lie close to the
    surface to minimise diffusion distance from blood in the lacunae
-   Materials such as oxygen, nutrients, vitamins, antibodies and water
    will diffuse from the lacunae into foetal capillaries
-   Foetal waste (such as carbon dioxide, urea and hormones) will
    diffuse from the lacunae into the maternal blood vessels

Exchange of Materials between Foetal and Maternal Blood

[placenta exchange]

Hormonal Role

-   The placenta takes over the hormonal role of the ovaries (at ~12
    weeks) and begins producing estrogen and progesterone
-   Estrogen stimulates the growth of uterine muscles (myometrium) and
    the development of the mammary glands
-   Progesterone maintains the endometrium, as well as reducing uterine
    contractions and potential maternal immune responses
-   Both estrogen and progesterone levels drop near the time of birth

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of diagrams of seminiferous tubule and ovary to show
the stages of gametogenesis

Â  Â Â 
The process of gametogenesis occurs in the reproductive organs (gonads)
of the male and female

-   In males, the gametes are produced within the seminiferous tubules
    of the testes
-   In females, the gametes are produced by the ovaries

Seminiferous Tubule

-   The testes are composed of seminiferous tubules which produce sperm
-   Each tubule is surrounded by a basement membrane which is lined by
    germline epithelium
-   The germline epithelium will divide by mitosis to make spermatogonia
    (which divide by meiosis to make spermatids)
-   The spermatids differentiate into functional spermatozoa, which are
    then released into the lumen of the tubule
-   These developing spermatozoa are nourished by Sertoli cells, which
    reside in the tubule lining
-   Outside of the tubules are blood capillaries and interstitial cells
    (Leydig cells) which produce testosterone

[seminiferous tubule]

Ovary

-   The ovary contains follicles in various stages of development
-   These follicles will develop over the course of a menstrual cycle
    and hence will not always be apparent upon inspection
-   Primordial follicles contain egg cells that have been arrested in
    prophase I (primary oocytes)
-   Some of these follicles will develop each month into primary
    follicles and then secondary follicles
-   Each cycle, one follicle will become a dominant Graafian follicle
    and rupture to release the secondary oocyte
-   The ruptured follicle will then develop into a short-lived
    corpusÂ luteum, which secretes key ovarian hormones
-   Eventually the corpus luteum will degenerate to form a corpus
    albicans

[ovary]

Cross-Sections of Reproductive Tissue

Spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules starts at the outer lining
of the tubule (germline epithelium)

-   As the germ cells divide by meiosis they move towards the inner
    lining before being released into the lumen as sperm
-   Non-dividing cells within the tubule lining will represent the
    Sertoli cells, which nourish and support the spermatocytes
-   Cells located externally to the tubule will likely represent
    interstitial cells (Leydig cells), which produce testosterone

Oogenesis in the ovaries is not a continuous process and proceeds
according to a monthly menstrual cycle

-   Consequently, certain developing follicles will only be visible at
    particular stages in the cycle
-   As a follicle matures it will grow larger in size, allowing for
    comparisons to be made between primary and secondary follicles
-   Unlike in spermatogenesis, the outer germline epithelium of the
    ovaries does not directly contribute to gamete formation

Semen Production

Semen is a fluid secreted by the male gonads and functions as a
transport medium for spermatozoa

-   There are three main components of the male reproductive system that
    are responsible for the production of semenÂ 

Epididymis

-   The epididymis functions to concentrate sperm that is produced in
    the seminiferous tubules by removing testicular fluids
-   The epididymis also serves as the location where sperm mature and
    develop a capacity toÂ â€˜swimâ€™

Seminal Vesicle

-   The seminal vesicle adds nutrients (including fructose), which
    provide the energy needed for the sperm toÂ â€˜swim'
-   It also secretes prostaglandins, which trigger uterine contractions
    that help move the sperm towards the egg

Prostate Gland

-   The prostate gland secretes alkaline fluids which help to neutralise
    vaginal acids
-   A localised pH change from (roughly) 4 to 6 functions to assist
    sperm motility

Structures Contributing to Semen Production

[semen production]

Male Sex Hormones

The production of sperm (and as a consequence, semen) is controlled by
three key hormones â€“ FSH, LH and testosterone

-   FSH and LH are produced by the brain (anterior pituitary), whereas
    testosterone is produced by interstitial (Leydig) cells

FSH

-   Initiates spermatogenesis by triggering the first meiotic division
    of spermatocytes
-   Also activates Sertoli cells, which provide nourishment for cells
    undergoing spermatogenesis

LH

-   Triggers the production of testosterone by Leydig cells in the
    interstitial tissue

Testosterone

-   Completes spermatogenesis by triggering the second meiotic division
    of spermatocytes
-   Stimulates the differentiation of spermatids to form mature
    spermatozoa

DNA Experiments

Griffithâ€™s Experiment

In 1928, Frederick Griffith conducted one of the first experiments to
show that cells possessed genetic material

Griffith's experiment involved the use of two strains of pneumococcus
â€“ a deadly virulent strain (S) or a non-virulent strain (R)

-   When Griffith infected mice with the non-virulent bacteria (strain
    R), the mice survived
-   When Griffith infected mice with the virulent bacteria (strain S),
    the mice died
-   When Griffith infected mice with heat-killed virulent bacteria
    (strain R), the mice survived as the bacteria had been killed
-   When Griffith infected mice with a mix of heat-killed strain S and
    living strain R, the mice were found to have died

From this Griffithâ€™s concluded that the living R cells had somehow
been transformed into virulent S cells

-   This indicated that there was some form of transferrable genetic
    material present within the cells (i.e. DNA)

Griffithâ€™s Experiment â€“ Demonstrating Bacterial Transformation

[Griffiths experiment]

Avery-MacLeod-McCarty Experiment

Oswald Avery and colleagues expanded upon the findings of Frederick
Griffith to demonstrate that DNA is the genetic material

-   They prepared cultures containing the heat-killed S strain and then
    removed lipids and carbohydrates from the solution
-   Next they treated the solutions with different digestive enzymes
    (DNase, RNase or protease) to destroy the targeted compound
-   Finally, they introduced living R strain cells to the culture to see
    which cultures would develop transformed S strain bacteria

Only in the culture treated with DNase did the S strain bacteria fail to
grow (i.e. no DNA = no transformation)

-   This indicated that DNA was the genetic component that was being
    transferred between cells

Despite this finding, the scientific community was reluctant to accept
the role of DNA as a genetic material

-   It was only 8 years later, when Hershey and Chase conducted their
    experiment, that the concept gained traction

DNA Structure Elucidation

Four scientists are generally recognised as having contributed to the
elucidation of DNA structure

-   Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins used X-ray diffraction
    techniques to identify key properties of the DNA molecule
-   Wilkins shared this data (without Franklinâ€™s permission)Â with two
    other scientists, James Watson and Francis Crick
-   Watson and Crick used this data to help construct an accurate model
    of DNA structure (as a doubleÂ helix)
-   In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel prize
    (Franklinâ€™s critical efforts were not recognised)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA replication is carried out by a complex system of enzymes

Â  Â Â 
DNA replication is a semi-conservative process that is carried out by a
complex system of enzymes

Helicase

-   Helicase unwinds and separates the double-stranded DNA by breaking
    the hydrogen bonds between base pairs
-   This occurs at specific regions (origins of replication), creating a
    replication fork of two strands running in antiparallel directions

DNA Gyrase

-   DNA gyrase reduces the torsional strain created by the unwinding of
    DNA byÂ helicase
-   It does this by relaxing positive supercoils (via negative
    supercoiling) that would otherwise form during the unwinding of DNA

Single Stranded Binding (SSB) Proteins

-   SSB proteins bind to the DNA strands after they have been separated
    and prevent the strands from re-annealing
-   These proteins also help to prevent the single stranded DNA from
    being digested by nucleases
-   SSB proteins will be dislodged from the strand when a new
    complementary strand is synthesised by DNA polymerase III

DNA Primase

-   DNA primase generates a short RNA primer (~10â€“15 nucleotides) on
    each of the template strands
-   The RNA primer provides an initiation point for DNA polymerase III,
    which can extend a nucleotide chain but not start one

DNA Polymerase III

-   Free nucleotides align opposite their complementary base partners (A
    = T ; G = C)
-   DNA pol III attaches to the 3â€™-end of the primerÂ and covalently
    joins the free nucleotides together in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction
-   As DNA strands are antiparallel, DNA pol III moves in opposite
    directions on the two strands
    -   On the leading strand, DNA pol III is moving towards the
        replication fork and can synthesise continuously
    -   On the lagging strand, DNA pol III is moving away from the
        replication fork and synthesises in pieces (Okazaki fragments)

DNA Polymerase I

-   As the lagging strand is synthesised in a series of short fragments,
    it has multiple RNA primers along its length
-   DNA pol I removes the RNA primers from the lagging strand and
    replaces them with DNA nucleotides

DNA Ligase

-   DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together to form a continuous
    strand
-   It does this by covalently joining the sugar-phosphate backbones
    together with a phosphodiester bond

â€¢ Â Use of nucleotides containing dideoxyribonucleic acid to stop DNA
replication in preparation of samplesÂ 

Â  Â  for base sequencing

Â  Â Â 
DNA sequencing refers to the process by which the base order of a
nucleotide sequence is elucidated

-   The most widely used method for DNA sequencing involves the use of
    chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides

Dideoxynucleotides

-   Dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) lack the 3â€™-hydroxyl group necessary
    for forming a phosphodiester bond
-   Consequently, ddNTPs prevent further elongation of a nucleotide
    chain and effectively terminate replication
-   The resulting length of a DNA sequence will reflect the specific
    nucleotide position at which the ddNTP was incorporated
    -   For example, if a ddGTP terminates a sequence after 8
        nucleotides, then the 8th nucleotide in the sequence is a
        cytosine

Determining Nucleotide Positions Using Dideoxynucleotides

[dideoxynucleotides]

Sequencing

Dideoxynucleotides can be used to determine DNA sequence using the
Sanger method

-   Four PCR mixes are set up, each containing stocks of normal
    nucleotides plus one dideoxynucleotide (ddA, ddT, ddC or ddG)
-   As a typical PCR will generate over 1 billion DNA molecules, each
    PCR mix should generate all the possible terminating fragments for
    that particular base
-   When the fragments are separated using gel electrophoresis, the base
    sequence can be determined by ordering fragments according to length
-   If a distinct radioactive or fluorescently labelled primer is
    included in each mix, the fragments can be detected by automated
    sequencing machines
-   If the Sanger method is conducted on the coding strand (non-template
    strand), the resulting sequence elucidated will be identical to the
    template strand

DNA Sequencing via the Sanger Method

Genes versus Repetitive DNA

Current estimates suggest that the human genome is comprised of < 20,000
genes (roughly 1.5% of the total sequence)

The vast majority of the genome consists of non-coding DNA sequences,
much of which is repetitive

These highly repetitive DNA sequences differ from unique, single copy
gene sequences in a number of key respects:

-   Proportion: Highly repetitive DNA makes up a much greater proportion
    of the genome than gene sequences
-   Rate of mutation: Gene sequences have a lower mutation rate (as any
    errors may affect protein synthesis)
-   Occurrence: Gene sequences are typically unique and occur once in
    the genome, whereas repetitive DNA is recurring
-   Function: Gene sequences are translated and code for proteins,
    highly repetitive DNA sequences are typically non-coding
-   Identification: Repetitive DNA sequences are commonly used for DNA
    profiling, gene sequences are not (too similar)
-   Length: A gene is made of a long unique sequence, while repetitive
    DNA sequences are typically composed of short repeats
-   Example: An example of a gene sequence is an exon, while an intron
    may be an example of non-coding, repetitive DNA

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of results of the Hershey and Chase experiment providing
evidence that DNA is the genetic material

Â  Â Â 
In the mid-twentieth century, scientists were still unsure as to whether
DNA or protein was the genetic material of the cell

-   It was known that some viruses consisted solely of DNA and a protein
    coat and could transfer their genetic material into hosts

In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase conducted a series of
experiments to prove that DNA was the genetic material

-   Viruses (T2 bacteriophage) were grown in one of two isotopic mediums
    in order to radioactively label a specific viral component
    -   Viruses grown in radioactive sulfur (³⁵S) had radiolabelled
        proteins (sulfur is present in proteins but not DNA)
    -   Viruses grown in radioactive phosphorus (³²P) had radiolabeled
        DNA (phosphorus is present in DNA but not proteins)

The viruses were then allowed to infect a bacterium (E. coli) and then
the virus and bacteria were separated via centrifugation

-   The larger bacteria formed a solid pellet while the smaller viruses
    remained in the supernatant

The bacterial pellet was found to be radioactive when infected by the
³²Pâ€“viruses (DNA) but not the ³⁵Sâ€“viruses (protein)

-   This demonstrated that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material
    because DNA was transferred to the bacteria

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some regions of DNA do not code for proteins but have other
important functions

Â  Â Â 
The vast majority of the human genome is comprised of non-coding DNA
(genes only account for ~ 1.5% of the total sequence)

-   Historically referred to asÂ â€˜junk DNAâ€™,Â these non-coding
    regions are now recognised to serve other important functions
-   Examples include satellite DNA, telomeres, introns, ncRNA genes and
    gene regulatory sequencesÂ 

Types of Non-Coding DNA

Application:

â€¢ Â Tandem repeats are used in DNA profiling

Â  Â Â 
DNA profiling is a technique by which individuals can be identified and
compared via their respective DNA profiles

-   Within the non-coding regions of an individualâ€™s genome there
    exists satellite DNA â€“ long stretches of DNA made up of repeating
    elements calledÂ short tandem repeatsÂ (STRs)Â 
-   Tandem repeats can be excised using restriction enzymes and then
    separated withÂ gel electrophoresis for comparison
-   As individuals will likely have different numbers of repeats at a
    given satellite DNA locus, they will generate unique DNA profiles
    -   Longer repeats will generate larger fragments, while shorter
        repeats will generate smaller fragments

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nucleosomes help to supercoil the DNA

Â  Â Â 
In eukaryotic organisms, the DNA is packaged with histone proteins to
create a compacted structure called a nucleosome

-   Nucleosomes help to supercoil the DNA, resulting in a greatly
    compacted structure that allows for more efficient storage
-   Supercoiling helps to protect the DNA from damage and also allows
    chromosomes to be mobile during mitosis and meiosis

Organisation of Eukaryotic DNA

-   The DNA is complexed with eight histone proteins (an octamer) to
    form a complex called aÂ nucleosome
-   Nucleosomes are linked by an additional histone protein (H1 histone)
    to form a string ofÂ chromatosomes
-   These then coil to form aÂ solenoid structureÂ (~6 chromatosomes per
    turn) which is condensed to form aÂ 30 nm fibre
-   These fibres then form loops, which are compressed and folded around
    a protein scaffold to formÂ chromatin
-   Chromatin will then supercoil during cell division to
    formÂ chromosomesÂ that are visible (when stained) under microscope

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Utilisation of molecular visualisation software to analyse the
association between protein and DNAÂ 

Â  Â  within the nucleosome

Â  Â Â 
A nucleosome consists of a molecule of DNA wrapped around a core of
eight histone proteins (an octamer)

-   The negatively charged DNA associates with positively charged amino
    acids on the surface of the histone proteins
-   The histone proteins have N-terminal tails which extrude outwards
    from the nucleosome
-   During chromosomal condensation, tails from adjacent histone
    octamers link up and draw the nucleosomes closer together

Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3â€™ end of a
primer

â€¢ Â DNA replication is continuous on the leading strand and
discontinuous on the lagging strand

Â  Â Â 
DNA polymerase cannot initiate replication, it can only add new
nucleotides to an existing strand

For DNA replication to occur, an RNA primer must first be synthesised to
provide an attachment point for DNA polymerase

DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3â€™Â end of a primer, extending
the new chain in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction

-   Free nucleotides exist as deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) â€“
    they have 3 phosphate groups
-   DNA polymerase cleaves the two additional phosphates and uses the
    energy released to form a phosphodiester bond with the 3â€™Â end of
    a nucleotide chain

Direction of DNA Synthesis

[replication direction]

Leading versus Lagging Strands

Because double-stranded DNA is antiparallel, DNA polymerase must move in
opposite directions on the two strands

-   On the leading strand, DNA polymerase is moving towards the
    replication fork and so can copy continuously
-   On the lagging strand, DNA polymerase is moving away from the
    replication fork, meaning copying is discontinuous
    -   As DNA polymerase is moving away from helicase, it must
        constantly return to copy newly separated stretches of DNA
    -   This means the lagging strand is copied as a series of short
        fragments (Okazaki fragments), each preceded by a primer
    -   The primers are replaced with DNA bases and the fragments joined
        together by a combination of DNA pol I and DNA ligase

primer)
Origins of Replication

Origins of replication are sequences where DNA replication is initiated
within a genome

-   Most bacteria have a single, circular molecule of DNA and possess
    only a single origin of replication
-   Eukaryotic chromosomes are usually significantly larger and hence
    possess many origins of replication along their length
-   DNA synthesis may occur bi-directionally from an origin of
    replication

DNA Synthesis at an Origin of Replication

[origin of replication]

When DNA replication occurs bi-directionally, the two replication forks
move in opposite directions to create a replication bubble

-   As replication bubbles expand in both directions, they will
    eventually fuse together as the intervening regions are copied
-   This functions to greatly limit the time required for DNA
    replication to occur

If human chromosomes did not possess multiple origins of replication, it
would take roughly one month to copy a chromosome

-   An average human chromosome is 150 million base pairs in length and
    DNA polymerase copies at a rate of ~ 50 bp / sec
-   150,000,000Â Ã· 50 = 3,000,000 seconds (Ã· 60) = 50,000 minutes
    (Ã· 60) = 833 hours (Ã· 24) = ~ 35 days

Application:

â€¢ Â Rosalind Franklinâ€™s and Maurice Wilkinsâ€™ investigation of DNA
structure by X-ray diffraction

Â  Â Â 
Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins used a method of X-ray diffraction
to investigate the structure of DNA

-   DNA was purified and then fibres were stretched in a thin glass tube
    (to make most of the strands parallel)
-   The DNA was targeted by a X-ray beam, which was diffracted when it
    contacted an atom
-   The scattering pattern of the X-ray was recorded on a film and used
    to elucidate details of molecular structure

Summary of the Process of X-Ray Crystallography

[x-ray crystallography]

From the scattering pattern produced by a DNA molecule, certain
inferences could be made about its structure

-   Composition: Â DNA is a double stranded molecule
-   Orientation: Â Nitrogenous bases are closely packed together on the
    inside and phosphates form an outer backbone
-   Shape: Â The DNA molecule twists at regular intervals (every 34
    Angstrom) to form a helix (two strands = double helix)

Franklinâ€™s data was shared by Wilkins with James Watson (without
Franklinâ€™sÂ permission) who, with the help of Francis Crick, used the
information to create a molecular model of the basic structure of DNA

-   In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins (but not Franklin) were awarded
    the Nobel prize for their contributions to DNA structure
    identification

Link: Â The Structure of DNA â€“ Cooperation and Competition

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA structure suggested a mechanism for DNA replication

Â  Â Â 
Franklinâ€™s x-ray diffraction experiments demonstrated that the DNA
helix is both tightly packed and regular in structure

-   Phosphates (and sugars) form an outer backbone and nitrogenous bases
    are packaged within the interior

Chargaff had also demonstrated thatÂ DNA is composed of an equal number
of purines (A + G) and pyrimidines (C + T)Â 

-   This indicates that these nitrogenous bases are paired (purine +
    pyrimidine) within the double helix
-   In order for this pairing between purines and pyrimidines to occur,
    the two strands must run in antiparallel directions

When Watson & Crick were developing their DNA model, they discovered
that an Aâ€“T bond was the same length as a Gâ€“C bond

-   Adenine and thymine paired via two hydrogen bonds, whereas guanine
    and cytosine paired via three hydrogen bonds
-   If the bases were always paired this way, then this would describe
    the regular structure of the DNA helix (shown by Franklin)

Consequently, DNA structure suggests two mechanisms for DNA replication:

-   Replication occurs via complementary base pairing (adenine pairs
    with thymine, guanine pairs with cytosine)
-   Replication is bi-directional (proceeds in opposite directions on
    the two strands) due to the antiparallel nature of the strands

Complementary Base Pairing as a Mechanism for DNA Replication

[purine-pyrimidine]
Supercoiling

Supercoiling refers to the additional twisting of a DNA strand and is an
expression of the strain on that strand

-   DNA can be overwound (positive supercoiling) orÂ underwound
    (negative supercoiling) â€“ most DNA is negatively supercoiled

Supercoiling functions to reduce the space required for DNA packaging,
allowing for more efficient storage of DNA

-   DNA will form positive supercoils when unwound byÂ helicase and
    requires an enzyme (DNA gyrase) to reduce the strain
-   In eukaryotic cells, nucleosomes help to supercoil DNAÂ 

Supercoiling in a Prokaryotic Cell

[supercoiling]

Â 
Telomerase

Telomeres are regions of repetitive DNA located at each end of a
chromatid and function to prevent chromosomal deterioration
During DNA replication, the extreme ends of theÂ telomere cannot be
copied and so the telomere gets marginally shorter

-   This occurs because the terminal RNA primer on the lagging strand
    cannot be replaced (no 3â€™-attachment point for DNA pol I)

The progressive shortening of telomeres is associated with ageing
(senescence), age-related diseases and mortalilty

-   Cells have a limited capacity for cellular division (Hayflick limit
    = ~ 40 â€“ 60 divisions for a typical human cell)
-   Telomeric shortening is suggested to be a reason for this limit, as
    cells may stop dividing when too much telomere DNA is lost

Telomeres can be lengthened by the enzyme telomerase, allowing for
continued cell division past the Hayflick limit

-   Permanent activation of telomerase can cause cells to become
    immortal and leads to cancer (uncontrolled cell division)
-   Many cancer researchers are currently investigating the viability of
    telomerase inhibitor drugs as a treatment for cancers

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nucleosomes help to regulate transcription in eukaryotes

Â  Â Â 
Eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to formÂ compact
nucleosomes

-   These histone proteins have protruding tails that determine how
    tightly the DNA is packaged

Modification of Histone Tails

Typically the histone tails have a positive charge and hence associate
tightly with the negatively charged DNA

-   Adding an acetyl group to the tail (acetylation) neutralises the
    charge, making DNA less tightly coiled and increasing transcription
-   Adding a methyl group to the tail (methylation) maintains the
    positive charge, making DNA more coiled and reducing transcription

Acetylation of Nucleosomes

[acetylation]

Types of Chromatin

When DNA is supercoiled and not accessible for transcription, it exists
as condensed heterochromatin

When the DNA is loosely packed and therefore accessible to the
transcription machinery, it exists as euchromatin

-   Different cell types will have varying segments of DNA packaged as
    heterochromatin and euchromatin
-   Some segments of DNA may be permanently supercoiled, while other
    segments may change over the life cycle of the cell

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of changes in the DNA methylation patterns

Â  Â Â 
Direct methylation of DNA (as opposed to the histone tails) can also
affect gene expression patterns

-   Increased methylation of DNA decreases gene expression (by
    preventing the binding of transcription factors)
-   Consequently, genes that are not transcribed tend to exhibit more
    DNA methylation than genes that are actively transcribed

Factors Contributing to DNA Methylation Patterns

[methylation factors]

Epigenetics

Epigenetics is the study of changes in phenotype as a result of
variations in gene expression levelsÂ 

-   Epigenetic analysis shows that DNA methylation patterns may change
    over the course of a lifetime
-   It is influenced by heritability but is not genetically
    pre-determined (identical twins may have different DNA methylation
    patterns)
-   Different cell types in the same organism may have markedly
    different DNA methylation patterns
-   Environmental factors (e.g. diet, pathogen exposure, etc.) may
    influence the level of DNA methylation within cells

Gene Expression

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gene expression is regulated by proteins that bind to specific
base sequences in DNA

Â  Â Â 
Transcriptional activity is regulated by two groups of proteins that
mediate binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter

Transcription factors form a complex with RNA polymerase at the promoter

-   RNA polymerase cannot initiate transcription without these factors
    and hence their levels regulate gene expression

Regulatory proteins bind to DNA sequences outside of the promoter and
interact with the transcription factors

-   Activator proteins bind to enhancer sites and increase the rate of
    transcription (by mediating complex formation)
-   Repressor proteins bind to silencer sequences and decrease the rate
    of transcription (by preventing complex formation)

The presence of certain transcription factors or regulatory proteins may
be tissue-specific

-   Additionally, chemical signals (e.g. hormones) can moderate protein
    levels and hence mediate a change in gene expression

Differential Gene Expression

[gene expression]

Control Elements

The DNA sequences thatÂ regulatory proteins bind to are called control
elements

-   Some control elements are located close to the promoter (proximal
    elements) while others are more distant (distal elements)
-   Regulatory proteins typically bind to distal control elements,
    whereas transcription factors usually bind to proximal elements
-   Most genes have multiple control elements and hence gene expression
    is a tightly controlled and coordinated process

Enhancers and Silencers

[enhancer silencer]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The environment of a cell and of an organism has an impact on gene
expression

Â  Â Â 
Changes in the external or internal environment can result in changes to
gene expression patterns

-   Chemical signals within the cell can trigger changes in levels of
    regulatory proteins or transcription factors in response to stimuli
-   This allows gene expression to change in response to alterations in
    intracellular and extracellular conditions

There are a number of examples of organisms changing their gene
expression patterns in response to environmental changes:

-   Hydrangeas change colour depending on the pH of the soil (acidic
    soil = blue flower ; alkaline soil = pink flower)
-   The Himalayan rabbit produces a different fur pigment depending on
    the temperature (>35ÂºC = white fur ; <30ÂºC = black fur)
-   Humans produce different amounts of melanin (skin pigment) depending
    on light exposure
-   Certain species of fish, reptile and amphibian can even change
    gender in response to social cues (e.g. mate availability)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Eukaryotic cells modify mRNA after transcription

Â  Â Â 
In eukaryotes, there are three post-transcriptional events that must
occur in order to form mature messenger RNA:

Capping

-   Capping involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5â€™-end of
    the transcribed RNA
-   The methylated cap provides protection against degradation
    byÂ exonucleases
-   It also allows the transcript to be recognised by the cellâ€™s
    translational machinery (e.g. nuclear export proteins and ribosome)

Polyadenylation

-   Polyadenylation describes the addition of a long chain of adenine
    nucleotidesÂ (a poly-A tail)Â to the 3â€™-end of the transcript
-   The poly-A tail improves the stability of the RNA transcript and
    facilitates its export from the nucleus

Splicing

-   Within eukaryotic genes are non-coding sequences called introns,
    which must be removed prior to forming mature mRNA
-   The coding regions are calledÂ exons and these are fused together
    when introns are removed to form a continuous sequence
-   Introns are intruding sequences whereas exons are expressing
    sequences
-   The process by which introns are removed is called splicing

Post-Transcriptional Modifications

[post transcription]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Splicing of mRNA increases the number of different proteins an
organism can produce

Â  Â Â 
Splicing can also result in the removal ofÂ exons â€“ a process known as
alternative splicing

The selective removal of specificÂ exons will result in the formation of
different polypeptides from a single gene sequence

-   For example, a particular protein may be membrane-bound or cytosolic
    depending on the presence of an anchoring motif

Alternative Splicing

[alternative splicing]
Microarrays

Microarrays can be used to determine gene expression patterns in a
particular cell or tissue

A DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA sequences (oligos)
attached to a solid surface

-   These sequences represent fractions of a large library of genes that
    are present in a cell
-   If a gene is active within a cell, then the cDNA (produced from the
    mRNA transcript) will bind to its complementary oligo
-   If the cDNA has been fluorescently labeled, then the complementary
    oligo can be identifiedÂ (along with the gene it represents)
-   If cDNA from healthy and diseased cells are labeled with different
    fluorophores, comparisons of gene expression can be made
-   Genes that areÂ onlyÂ active in a diseased or normal state will be
    of particular interest to scientists

DNA Microarray Overview

[]
Operons

An operon is a sequence of DNA containing a cluster of genes under the
control of a single promoter

-   Hence, genes within an operon will always be expressed together or
    not at all (their expression patterns are linked)

There are three basic components to an operon

-   Promoter â€“ Upstream sequence to which RNA polymerase binds
-   Operator â€“ Segment of DNA to which a repressor protein binds
    (inhibits transcription by obstructing RNA polymerase)
-   Structural genes â€“ Genes that are collectively regulated by the
    operon

Operons are related to stimulons and regulons:

-   Stimulon â€“ Set of genes under regulation from a single cell
    stimulus
-   Regulon â€“ Set of genes under regulation from a single regulatory
    protein (each gene has a different operator though)

Originally, operons were thought to exist only in prokaryotes, however
examples have since been found in eukaryotes

Structure of an Operon

[operon]
Reverse Transcription

In 1970 it was discovered that retroviruses could copy DNA from an RNA
sequence

-   These viruses possess an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that allows
    for reverse transcription to occur
-   Reverse transcription is now commonly used in scientific studies to
    establish gene expression profiles

cDNA

-   Complementary DNA (cDNA) is a molecule synthesised from an mRNA
    template via reverse transcription
-   cDNA molecules represent gene sequences that areÂ actively
    transcribedÂ by a cell (as they were synthesised from mRNA)Â 
-   This makes them a valuable tool for determining expression patterns
    of proteins in normal and diseased states
-   cDNA molecules are also commonly used in gene transfer experiments
    as they do not possess introns

DNAÂ âŸ· RNA

[central dogma]
RNA Interference

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is
roughly 20 â€“ 25 base pairs in length

siRNA interferes with the expression of genes by causing the mRNA
transcripts to be broken prior to translation

-   Â When theÂ siRNA is unwound, one strand (the passenger strand) is
    degraded and one strand (the guide strand) remains
-   The guide strand will hybridise to its complementary mRNA sequence
    and recruit a protein complex called RISC
-   RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) will then destroy the targeted
    mRNA, preventing translation of the associated gene

Application:

â€¢ Â The promoter as an example of non-coding DNA with a function

Â  Â Â 
A gene is a sequence of DNA which is transcribed into RNA and contains
three main parts:

Promoter

-   The non-coding sequence responsible for the initiation of
    transcription
-   The core promoter is typically located immediately upstream of the
    geneâ€™s coding sequence
-   The promoter functions as a binding site for RNA polymerase (the
    enzyme responsible for transcription)
-   The binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter is mediated and
    controlled by an array of transcription factors in eukaryotes
-   These transcription factors bind to either proximal control elements
    (near the promoter) or distal control elements (at a distance)

Coding Sequence

-   After RNA polymerase has bound to the promoter, it causes the DNA
    strands to unwind and separate
-   The region of DNA that is transcribed by RNA polymerase is called
    the coding sequence

Terminator

-   RNA polymerase will continue to transcribe the DNA until it reaches
    a terminator sequence
-   The mechanism for transcriptional termination differs between
    prokaryotes and eukaryotes

Sections of a Gene

[sections of a gene]

Antisense vs Sense

A gene (DNA) consists of two polynucleotide strands, but only one is
transcribed into RNA

-   TheÂ antisense strand is the strand that is transcribed into RNA
    -   Its sequence is complementary to the RNA sequence and will be
        the "DNA versionâ€?Â of the tRNA anticodon sequence
    -   The antisense strand is also referred to as the template strand
-   The sense strand is the strand that is not transcribed into RNA
    -   Its sequence will be theÂ â€œDNA versionâ€?Â of the RNA sequence
        (i.e. identical except for T instead of U)
    -   The sense strand is also referred to as the coding strand
        (because it is a DNA copy of the RNA sequence)

Either of the 2 polynucleotide strands may contain a gene, and hence the
determination of sense and antisense is gene specific

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Transcription occurs in a 5â€™ to 3â€™ direction

Â  Â Â 
Transcription is the process by which a DNA sequence (gene) is copied
into a complementary RNA sequence by RNA polymerase

-   Free nucleotides exist in the cell as nucleoside triphosphates
    (NTPs), which line up opposite their complementary base partner
-   RNA polymerase covalently binds the NTPs together in a reaction that
    involves the release of the two additional phosphates
-   The 5â€™-phosphate is linked to the 3â€™-end of the growing mRNA
    strand, hence transcription occurs in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction

Direction of Transcription

This browser cannot play the embedded video file.

Overview of Transcription

The process of transcription can be divided into three main steps:
initiation, elongation and termination

-   In initiation, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and causes the
    unwinding and separating of the DNA strands
-   Elongation occurs as the RNA polymerase moves along the coding
    sequence, synthesising RNA in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction
-   When RNA polymerase reaches the terminator, both the enzyme and
    nascent RNA strand detach and the DNA rewinds

Many RNA polymerase enzymes can transcribe a DNA sequence sequentially,
producing a large number of transcriptsÂ 

-   In eukaryotes, post-transcriptional modification of the RNA sequence
    is necessary to form mature mRNA

Types of RNA

RNA functions to transfer genetic instructions from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, where the information is decoded

There are three main types of RNA which cooperate to complete this goal:

-   Messenger RNAÂ (mRNA)Â â€“ a transcript copy of a gene which encodes
    a specific polypeptide
-   Transfer RNAÂ (tRNA)Â â€“ carries the polypeptide subunits (amino
    acids) to the organelle responsible for synthesis (ribosome)
-   Ribosomal RNAÂ (rRNA)Â â€“ a primary component of the ribosome and
    is responsible for its catalytic activity

Additionally, cells may produce other variants of non-coding RNA to
support and regulate the expression of genes:

-   Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) â€“ a component of the spliceosome
    (involved in splicing of introns)
-   Short interfering RNA (siRNA) â€“ moderates gene expression levels
    via RNA interference (RNAi)

Three Main Types of RNA

[]
Amino Acid Polarity

Amino acids may be either polar or non-polar depending on the
composition of their side chain

-   Polar amino acids have hydrophilic R groups, while non-polar amino
    acids have hydrophobic R groups

The localisation of polar and non-polar amino acids will be determined
by the type of protein and its function:
Water soluble proteins:

-   Non-polar amino acids tend to be found in the centre of the molecule
    (stabilise the structure)
-   Polar amino acids tend to be located on the protein surface (capable
    of interacting with water molecules)

Membrane-bound proteins:

-   Non-polar amino acids tend to be located on the regions of the
    surface in contact with the membrane
-   Polar amino acids will generally line interior pores (to create
    hydrophilic channels)

Enzymes:

-   The active site specifically depends on the location and
    distribution of polar and non-polar amino acids as hydrophobic and
    hydrophilic interactions can play a role in substrate binding to the
    active site

Polar versus Non-Polar Amino Acids

[]
Fibrous vs Globular Proteins

There are two main classes of protein tertiary structure:

-   Fibrous proteinsÂ are generally composed of long and narrow strands
    and have a structural role (theyÂ areÂ something)
-   Globular proteinsÂ generally have a more compact and rounded shape
    and have functional roles (theyÂ doÂ something)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Translation can occur immediately after transcription in
prokaryotes due to the absence of aÂ nuclear membrane

Â  Â Â 
In eukaryotes, the ribosomes are separated from the genetic material
(DNA and RNA) by the nucleus

-   After transcription, the mRNA must be transported from the nucleus
    (via nuclear pores) prior to translation by the ribosome
-   This transport requires modification to the RNA construct (e.g.
    5â€™-methyl capping and 3â€™-polyadenylation)

Prokaryotes lack compartmentalised structures (like the nucleus) and so
transcription and translation need not be separated

-   Ribosomes may begin translating the mRNA molecule while it is still
    being transcribed from the DNA template
-   This is possible because both transcription and translation occur in
    a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â directionÂ

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of polysomes in electron micrographs of prokaryotes
and eukaryotes

Â  Â Â 
A polysome (or a polyribosome) is a group of two or more ribosomes
translating an mRNA sequence simultaneously

-   The polysomes will appear as beads on a string (each 'bead'
    represents a ribosome ; theÂ â€˜stringâ€™Â is the mRNA strand)
-   In prokaryotes, the polysomes may form while the mRNA is still being
    transcribed from the DNA template
-   Ribosomes located at the 3â€™-end of the polysome cluster will have
    longer polypeptide chains that those at the 5â€™-end

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Free ribosomes synthesise proteins for use primarily within the
cell

â€¢ Â Bound ribosomes synthesise proteins primarily for secretion or for
use in lysosomesÂ 

Â  Â Â 
All proteins produced by eukaryotic cells are initially synthesised by
ribosomes found freely circulating within the cytosol

-   If the protein is targeted for intracellular use within the cytosol,
    the ribosome remains free and unattached
-   If the protein is targeted for secretion, membrane fixation or use
    in lysosomes, the ribosome becomes bound to the ER

Protein destination is determined by the presence or absence of an
initial signal sequence on a nascent polypeptide chain

-   The presence of this signal sequence results in the recruitment of a
    signal recognition particle (SRP), which halts translation
-   The SRP-ribosome complex then docks at a receptor located on the ER
    membrane (formingÂ rough ER)
-   Translation is re-initiated and the polypeptide chain continues to
    grow via a transport channel into the lumen of the ER
    -   The synthesised protein will then be transported via a vesicle
        to the Golgi complex (for secretion) or the lysosome
    -   Proteins targeted for membrane fixation (e.g. integral proteins)
        get embedded into the ER membrane
-   The signal sequence is cleaved and the SRP recycled once the
    polypeptide is completely synthesised within the ER

The Role of the Signal Recognition Particle in Protein Destination

[SRP]
Protein Expression

There are a number of ways via which protein expression patterns can
beÂ moderated:
1. Â Transcriptional control

-   Protein expression can be regulated by controlling to amount of
    transcription (less mRNA = less protein)
-   This level of control is achieved primarily through the coordinated
    effects of transcription factors and regulatory proteins

2. Â RNA processing control

-   This involves regulating the formation of mature mRNA in eukaryotes
    (e.g.Â 5â€™-capping and 3â€™-polyadenylation)
-   These processes are necessary to help direct the mRNA to the
    ribosome and prevent its premature degradation

3. Â RNA transport control

-   In eukaryotes, RNA must be transported out of the nucleus (through
    nuclear pores) in order to associate with the ribosome
-   If this transport is prevented, the related protein cannot by
    synthesised

4. Â Translational control

-   Protein expression can also be regulated by controlling the amount
    of translation
-   This may involve inhibiting ribosomal subunit assembly or actively
    targeting mRNA for degradation

5. Â Protein activity control

-   Protein expression patterns may also be affected by the rate of
    protein degradation
-   Post-translational modifications (such as ubiquitination or
    phosphorylation) may target proteins for destruction

Mechanisms of Regulating Protein Expression Levels

[protein expression]
Protein Modification

Post-translational modifications refer to any change in the chemical
composition of proteins following translation

-   These modifications may be vital to the formation of a mature,
    functional protein (e.g. common in cell signalling components)

Addition of new functional groups

-   Enzymes may modify protein structure via the introduction of a new
    chemical group to specific amino acids in the molecule
-   This can include phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation,
    glycosylation, ubiquitination, lipidation, biotination, etc.
-   The addition of chemical groups may alter the properties of the
    chain and induce conformational changes â€“ affecting activity

Proteolytic cleavage of existing elements

-   Proteins may also be modified via the removal of specific amino acid
    segments from a propeptide
-   This occurs in zymogens, where the active site is occluded and
    inactive until proteolytic cleavage occurs
-   The hormone insulin also requires the separation of a middle segment
    to form two polypeptides chains linked by disulfide bridges
-   Another common form of proteolytic cleavage is the removal of the
    initiator methionine residue

Racemization

-   Amino acids can exist as chiral enantiomers ('mirror image'
    stereoisomers)
-   Racemization involves converting proteins from one enantiomeric
    arrangement to a different enantiomeric arrangement
-   Different enantiomers may have distinct chemical properties due to
    the ability to form different intermolecular interactions

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide is the
primary structure

Â  Â Â 
Primary (1Âº) Structure

-   The first level of structural organisation in a protein is the order
    / sequence of amino acids which comprise the polypeptide chain
-   The primary structure is formed by covalent peptide bonds between
    the amine and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids
-   Primary structure controls all subsequent levels of protein
    organisation because it determines the nature of the interactions
    between R groups of different amino acids

[primary structure]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The secondary structure is the formation ofÂ Î±-helices
andÂ Î²-pleated sheets stabilised by hydrogen bonding

Â  Â Â 
Secondary (2Âº) Structure

-   The secondary structure is the way a polypeptide folds in a
    repeating arrangement to formÂ Î±-helices andÂ Î²-pleated sheets
-   This folding is a result of hydrogen bonding between the amine and
    carboxyl groups of non-adjacent amino acids
-   Sequences that do not form either an alpha helix or beta-pleated
    sheet will exist as a random coil
-   Secondary structure provides the polypeptide chain with a level of
    mechanical stability (due to the presence of hydrogen bonds)
-   In pictures, alpha helices are represented as spirals (purple ;
    left) and beta-pleated sheets as arrows (blue ; right)

[alpha helices beta sheets]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The tertiary structure is the further folding of the polypeptide
stabilised by interactions between R groups

Â  Â Â 
Tertiary (3Âº) Structure

-   The tertiary structure is the way the polypeptide chain coils and
    turns to form a complex molecular shape (i.e. theÂ 3D shape)
-   It is caused by interactions between R groups; including H-bonds,
    disulfide bridges, ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions
-   Relative amino acid positions are important (e.g. non-polar amino
    acids usually avoid exposure to aqueous solutions)
-   Tertiary structure may be important for the function of the protein
    (e.g. specificity of active site in enzymes)

[tertiary structure]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The quaternary structure exists in proteins with more than one
polypeptide chain

Â  Â Â 
Quaternary (4Âº) Structure

-   Multiple polypeptides or prosthetic groups may interact to form a
    single, larger, biologically active protein (quaternary structure)
-   A prosthetic group is an inorganic compound involved in protein
    structure or function (e.g. the heme group in haemoglobin)
-   A protein containing a prosthetic group is called a conjugated
    protein
-   Quaternary structures may be held together by a variety of bonds
    (similar to tertiary structure)

Ribosomes

-   Ribosomes are made of protein (for stability) and ribosomal RNA (for
    catalytic activity)
-   They consist of a large and small subunit:
    -   The small subunit contains an mRNA binding site
    -   The large subunit contains three tRNA binding sites â€“ an
        aminoacyl (A) site, a peptidyl (P) site and an exit (E) site
-   Ribosomes can be found either freely floating in the cytosol or
    bound to the rough ER (in eukaryotes)
-   Ribosomes differ in size in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (prokaryotes
    = 70S ; eukaryotes = 80S)

Structure of a Ribosome

[ribosome structure]

Transfer RNA (tRNA)

tRNA molecules fold into a cloverleaf structure with four key regions:

-   The acceptor stem (3â€™-CCA) carries an amino acid
-   The anticodon associates with the mRNA codon (via complementary base
    pairing)
-   The T arm associates with the ribosome (via the E, P and A binding
    sites)
-   The D arm associates with the tRNA activating enzyme (responsible
    for adding the amino acid to the acceptor stem)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Initiation of translation involves assembly of the components that
carry out the process

Â  Â Â 
Initiation

The first stage of translation involves the assembly of the three
components that carry out the process (mRNA, tRNA, ribosome)

-   The small ribosomal subunit binds to the 5â€™-end of the mRNA and
    moves along it until it reaches the start codon (AUG)
-   Next, the appropriate tRNA molecule bind to the codon via its
    anticodon (according to complementary base pairing)
-   Finally, the large ribosomal subunit aligns itself to the tRNA
    molecule at the P site and forms a complex with the small subunit

[translation initiation]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synthesis of the polypeptide involves a repeated cycle of events

Â  Â Â 
Elongation

-   A second tRNA molecule pairs with the next codon in the ribosomal A
    site
-   The amino acid in the P site is covalently attached via a peptide
    bond (condensation reaction) to the amino acid in the A site
-   The tRNA in the P site is now deacylated (no amino acid), while the
    tRNA in the A site carries the peptide chain

Translocation

-   The ribosome moves along the mRNA strand by one codon position (in a
    5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction)
-   The deacylated tRNA moves into the E site and is released, while the
    tRNA carrying the peptide chain moves to the P site
-   Another tRNA molecules attaches to the next codon in the now
    unoccupied A site and the process is repeated

[translation elongation]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Disassembly of the components follows termination of translation

Â  Â Â 
Termination

The final stage of translation involves the disassembly of the
components and the release of a polypeptide chain

-   Elongation and translocation continue in a repeating cycle until the
    ribosome reaches a stop codonÂ 
-   These codons do not recruit a tRNA molecule, but instead recruit a
    release factor that signals for translation to stop
-   The polypeptide is released and the ribosome disassembles back into
    its two independent subunits

Application:

â€¢ Â tRNA-activating enzymes illustrate enzyme-substrate specificity
and the role of phosphorylation

Â  Â Â 
Each tRNA molecule binds with a specific amino acid in the cytoplasm in
a reaction catalysed by a tRNA-activating enzyme

-   Each amino acid is recognised by a specific enzyme (the enzyme may
    recognise multiple tRNA molecules due to degeneracy)

The binding of an amino acid to the tRNA acceptor stem occurs as a
result of a two-step process:

-   The enzyme binds ATP to the amino acid to form an amino acidâ€“AMP
    complex linked by a high energy bond (PP released)
-   The amino acid is then coupled to tRNA and the AMP is released â€“
    the tRNA molecule is nowÂ â€œchargedâ€?Â and ready for use

The function of the ATP (phosphorylation) is to create a high energy
bond that is transferred to the tRNA molecule

-   This stored energy will provide the majority of the energy required
    for peptide bond formation during translation

Visualising Proteins

The following are a selection of protein molecules that highlight
different aspects of protein structure

-   Click on the links provided to view the interactive pop up

Haemoglobin

-   Haemoglobin is a globular protein responsible for oxygen transport
    within red blood cells
-   It has a quaternary structure made up of four polypeptide subunits
    (2 alpha subunits and 2 beta subunits)
-   Each polypeptide chain is associated with a prosthetic heme group
    (responsible for oxygen binding)

Aquaporin

-   Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins that form channels that
    allow for the passage of water molecules
-   Aquaporins form tetramers in the cell membrane, with each monomer
    allowing for water movement
-   The pores of the aquaporin are impermeable to charged species, thus
    preventing the passage of ions or solutes

Keratin

-   Keratin is a fibrous protein that functions as a key structural
    material in hair, skin and nails
-   Keratin proteins form long twisted strands that may interconnect via
    disulphide bridges
-   Tougher keratin fibres found in hair and nails have more disulphide
    bridges than more elastic keratin fibres found in skin

Green Fluorescent Protein

-   Green fluorescent protein is a fluorophore produced by jellyfish
    (and commonly used in recombinant DNA experiments)
-   The fluorescing chromophore is attached to a central alpha helix,
    which is surrounded by 11 beta strands forming a barrel
-   The tightly packed beta barrel excludes solvent molecules and
    functions to protect the chromophore from quenching by water

Accessory Pigments

Photosynthetic organisms do not rely on a single pigment to absorb
light, but instead benefit from the combined action of many

-   These photosynthetic pigments are grouped into photosystems that
    absorb and funnel light energy
-   By grouping pigments that have individualised absorption spectra
    together, the cell maximises its light absorption

When a pigment is energised by light, it releases high energy electrons
(ionisation)

-   Antenna pigments transfer their energised electrons to a central
    reaction centre
-   From the reaction centre, electrons are passed on to an acceptor
    molecule in an electron transport chain to synthesise ATP

The presence of accessory pigments explains why not all leaves are green

-   While chlorophyll possesses a green colouration, other pigments
    (e.g.Â anthocyanins) may produce different colours
-   Deciduous trees change colour when leaves stop producing chlorophyll
    in winter when levels of available light are low

Representations of the Transfer of Energy by Antenna Pigments

C3, C4 and CAM Plants

The Calvin cycle uses the enzyme Rubisco (RuBP carboxylase) to fix CO₂
to RuBP and make a 3C compound (GP)

-   Plants that fix carbon dioxide directly from the air are called C₃
    plants (as the initial product is a 3C compound)

Rubisco can also use oxygen (O₂) as an alternative substrate to undergo
a series of reactions known as photorespiration

-   Photorespiration creates a product that cannot be used to make
    sugars and hence reduces the efficiency of the Calvin cycle
-   Photorespiration reduces levels of photosynthesis by up to ~25% in
    C₃ plants, reducing energy yield in these plants

Photorespiration vs Photosynthesis

[photorespiration]

C₄ and CAM Plants

Because oxygen acts as a competitive inhibitor for Rubisco,
photosynthesis in C₃ plants is reduced in the presence of oxygen

-   C₃ plants are less efficient in hot and dry regions, as stomata must
    remain closed to prevent excessive water loss
-   When stomata are closed, O₂ cannot diffuse out of the leaf,
    increasing O₂ concentration relative to CO₂

In these hot and arid conditions, other types of plants have evolved to
limit the exposure of Rubisco to oxygen

-   C₄ and CAM plantsÂ uses the enzyme PEP carboxylase to combine CO₂ to
    a 3C compound (PEP) and make a 4C compound
-   PEP carboxylase has a higher affinity for CO₂ than Rubisco and
    doesnâ€™t bind to oxygen at all
-   These plants can then transfer the CO₂Â (stored in the 4C compound)
    to regions with low oxygen concentrations

In the C₄ pathway, carbon dioxide is physically separated from oxygen in
order to improve CO₂ binding to RubiscoÂ 

-   The CO₂ is converted to a 4C compound and then sequestered to a
    deeper tissue layer where less oxygen is present
-   In this deeper tissue layer, the CO₂ is released and can enter the
    Calvin cycle without competition from oxygen

In the CAM pathway, carbon dioxide reserves are created (temporal
isolation) in order to improve CO₂ binding to Rubisco

-   CAM plants are adapted to arid environments where water loss is high
    and stomata must remain closed during the day
-   The CO₂ is converted into a 4C compound during the night, when
    stomata are open and CO₂ is able to diffuse into the leaf
-   This allows reserves of CO₂ to be created for use during the day,
    when stomata are closed and O₂ cannot be released

The light independent reactions are also collectively known as the
Calvin cycle â€“ named after American chemist Melvin Calvin

-   Calvin mapped the complete conversion of carbon within a plant
    during the process of photosynthesis

Calvinâ€™s elucidation of photosynthetic carbon compounds is commonly
classed theÂ â€˜lollipop experimentâ€™

-   This is due to the fact that the apparatus he utilised was thought
    to resemble an upside-down lollipop

Lollipop Experiment

-   Radioactive carbon-14 is added to aÂ â€˜lollipopâ€™Â apparatus
    containing green algae (Chlorella)
-   Light is shone on the apparatus to induce photosynthesis (which will
    incorporate the carbon-14 into organic compounds)
-   After different periods of time, the algae is killed by running it
    into a solution of heated alcohol (stops cell metabolism)
-   Dead algal samples are analysed using 2D chromatography, which
    separates out the different carbon compounds
-   Any radioactive carbon compounds on the chromatogram were then
    identified using autoradiography (X-ray film exposure)
-   By comparing different periods of light exposure, the order by which
    carbon compounds are generated was determined
-   Calvin used this information to propose a sequence of events known
    as the Calvin cycle (light independent reactions) Â

Key Events of the Calvin Cycle

The Calvin cycle outlines the events that result in the formation of
organic molecules from inorganic sources (CO₂)

-   Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) is carboxylated by carbon
    dioxideÂ (CO₂) to form a hexose biphosphate compound
-   The hexose biphosphate compound immediately breaks down into
    molecules ofÂ glycerate-3-phosphate (GP)
-   The GP is converted by ATP and NADPH into molecules of triose
    phosphate (TP)
-   TP can be used to form organic molecules or can be recombined by ATP
    to reform stocks of RuBP

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The structure of the chloroplast is adapted to its function in
photosynthesis

Â  Â 
Chloroplasts are theÂ â€™solar energy plantsâ€™Â of a cell â€“ they
convert light energy into chemical energy

-   This chemical energy may be either ATP (light dependent) or organic
    compounds (light independent)
-   Only photosynthetic tissue possess chloroplasts (e.g. is present in
    leaves but not roots of plants)

Chloroplasts are thought to have once been independent prokaryotes that
were internalised by eukaryotes via endosymbiosis

-   They have a double membrane structure (due to vesicular coating as
    part of the endocytotic process)
-   They have their own DNA (circular and naked) and ribosomes (70S)
-   Their metabolic processes are susceptible to certain antibiotics

The structure of the chloroplast is adapted to the function it performs:

-   Thylakoids â€“ flattened discs have a small internal volume to
    maximise hydrogen gradient upon proton accumulationÂ 
-   GranaÂ â€“ thylakoids are arranged into stacks to increase SA:Vol
    ratio of the thylakoid membrane
-   PhotosystemsÂ â€“ pigments organised into photosystems in thylakoid
    membrane to maximise light absorption
-   StromaÂ â€“ central cavity that contains appropriate enzymes and a
    suitable pH for the Calvin cycle to occur
-   Lamellae â€“ connects and separates thylakoid stacks (grana),
    maximising photosynthetic efficiency

    by lamellae
-   Internal lumen of thylakoids is very small (allows for a more rapid
    generation of a proton motive force)

-   Artificial photosynthesis is intended to produce 'cleanâ€™Â energy,
    with heat the only product released

Artificial photosynthesis involves constructing systems that will
undertake three key steps:

-   Harvest light energy (e.g. using chromophores)Â 
-   Transduce this energy to electrons (a photosensitiser can then be
    used to transfer the electrons)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Absorption of light by photosystems generates excited electrons

â€¢ Â Transfer of excited electrons occurs between carriers in thylakoid
membranes

Â  Â Â 
The light dependent reactions use photosynthetic pigments (organised
into photosystems) to convert light energy into chemical energy
(specifically ATP and NADPH)
These reactions occur within specialised membrane discs within the
chloroplast called thylakoids and involve three steps:

-   Excitation of photosystems by light energy
-   Production of ATP via an electron transport chain
-   Reduction of NADP⁺ and the photolysis of water

Step 1: Â Excitation of Photosystems by Light Energy

-   Photosystems are groups of photosynthetic pigments (including
    chlorophyll) embedded within the thylakoid membrane
-   Photosystems are classed according to their maximal absorption
    wavelengths (PS I = 700 nm ; PS II = 680 nm)
-   When a photosystem absorbs light energy, delocalised electrons
    within the pigments become energised orÂ â€˜excited'
-   These excited electrons areÂ transferred to carrier molecules within
    the thylakoid membrane

[light dependent 1]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Excited electrons from Photosystem II are used to contribute to
generate a proton gradient

â€¢ Â ATP synthase in thylakoids generates ATP using the proton gradient

Â  Â  Â Â 
Step 2: Â Production of ATP via an Electron Transport Chain

-   Excited electrons from Photosystem II (P680) are transferred to an
    electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane
-   As the electrons are passed through the chain they lose energy,
    which is used to translocate H⁺ ions into the thylakoid
-   This build up of protons within the thylakoid creates an
    electrochemical gradient, or proton motive force
-   The H⁺ ions return to the stroma (along the proton gradient) via the
    transmembrane enzyme ATP synthase (chemiosmosis)
-   ATP synthase uses the passage of H⁺ ions to catalyse the synthesis
    of ATP (from ADP + Pi)
-   This process is called photophosphorylation â€“ as light provided
    the initial energy source for ATP production
-   The newly de-energised electrons from Photosystem II are taken up by
    Photosystem I

â€¢ Â Excited electrons from Photosystem I are used to reduce NADP

â€¢ Â Photolysis of water generates electrons for use in the light
dependent reactions

Â  Â  Â 
Step 3: Â Reduction of NADP+ and the Photolysis of Water

-   Excited electrons from Photosystem I may be transferred to a carrier
    molecule and used to reduce NADP⁺
-   This forms NADPH â€“ which is needed (in conjunction with ATP) for
    the light independent reactions
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem I are replaced by de-energised
    electrons from Photosystem II
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem II are replaced by electrons
    released from water via photolysis
-   Water is split by light energy into H⁺ ions (used in chemiosmosis)
    and oxygen (released as a by-product)

[light dependent 3]

Overview of the Light Dependent Reactions

-   The light dependent reactions occur within the intermembrane space
    of the thylakoids
-   Chlorophyll in Photosystems I and II absorb light, which triggers
    the release of high energy electrons (photo activation)
-   Excited electrons from Photosystem II are transferred between
    carrier molecules in an electron transport chain
-   The electron transport chain translocates H⁺ ions from the stroma to
    within the thylakoid, creating a proton gradient
-   The protons are returned to theÂ stroma via ATP synthase, which uses
    their passage (via chemiosmosis) to synthesise ATP
-   Excited electrons from Photosystem I are used to reduce NADP⁺
    (forming NADPH)
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem I are replaced by the
    de-energised electrons from Photosystem II
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem II are replaced following the
    photolysis of water
-   The products of the light dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) are
    used in the light independent reactions

Z Scheme

The energy changes (oxidation / reduction) that occur during
photosynthesis may be represented as a Z scheme:

-   First vertical bar: Â Photosystem II electrons are energised by
    light (electrons replaced by photolysis of water molecules)
-   Diagonal bar: Â Electrons lose energy as they pass through an
    electron transport chain (synthesising ATP)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In the light independent reactions a carboxylase catalyses the
carboxylation of ribulose bisphosphate

Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
The light independent reactions use the chemical energy derived from
light dependent reactions to form organic molecules

-   The light independent reactions occur in the fluid-filled space of
    the chloroplast called the stroma

The light independent reactions are collectively known as the Calvin
cycle and involve three main steps:

-   Carboxylation of ribulose bisphosphate
-   Reduction ofÂ glycerate-3-phosphate
-   Regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate

Step 1: Â Carbon Fixation

-   The Calvin cycle begins with a 5C compound called ribulose
    bisphosphate (or RuBP)
-   An enzyme, RuBP carboxylase (or Rubisco), catalyses the attachment
    of a CO₂ molecule to RuBP
-   The resulting 6C compound is unstable, and breaks down into two 3C
    compounds â€“ calledÂ glycerate-3-phosphate (GP)
-   A single cycle involves three molecules of RuBP combining with three
    molecules of CO₂ to make six molecules of GP

[calvin1]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Glycerate-3-phosphate is reduced to triose phosphate using reduced
NADP and ATP

Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
Step 2: Â Reduction of Glycerate-3-Phosphate

-   Glycerate-3-phosphate (GP) is converted into triose phosphate (TP)
    using NADPH and ATP
-   Reduction by NADPH transfers hydrogen atoms to the compound, while
    the hydrolysis of ATP provides energy
-   Each GP requires one NADPH and one ATP to form a triose phosphate
    â€“ so a single cycle requires six of each molecule

[calvin2]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Triose phosphate is used to regenerate RuBP and produce
carbohydrates

â€¢ Â Ribulose bisphosphate is reformed using ATP

Â  Â Â 
Step 3: Â Regeneration of RuBP

-   Of the six molecules of TP produced per cycle, one TP molecule may
    be used to form half a sugar molecule
-   Hence two cycles are required to produce a single glucose monomer,
    and more to produce polysaccharides like starch
-   The remaining five TP molecules are recombined to regenerate stocks
    of RuBP Â (5Â Ã— 3C = 3Â Ã— 5C)Â 
-   The regeneration of RuBP requires energy derived from the hydrolysis
    of ATP

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Reduced NADP and ATP are produced in the light dependent reactions

Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
The production of ATP by the light dependent reactions is called
photophosphorylation, as it uses light as an energy source

-   Photophosphorylation may be either a cyclic process or a non-cyclic
    process

Cyclic Photophosphorylation

-   Cyclic photophosphorylation involves the use of only one photosystem
    (PS I) and does not involve the reduction of NADP⁺
-   When light is absorbed by Photosystem I, the excited electron may
    enter into an electron transport chain to produce ATP
-   Following this, the de-energised electron returns to the
    photosystem, restoring its electron supply (hence: cyclic)
-   As the electron returns to the photosystem, NADP⁺ is not reduced and
    water is not needed to replenish the electron supply

[cyclic photophos]

Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation

-   Non-cyclic photophosphorylation involves two photosystems (PS I and
    PS II) and does involve the reduction of NADP⁺
-   When light is absorbed by Photosystem II, the excited electrons
    enter into an electron transport chain to produce ATP
-   Concurrently, photoactivation of Photosystem I results in the
    release of electrons which reduce NADP⁺ (forms NADPH)
-   The photolysis of water releases electrons which replace those lost
    by Photosystem II (PS I electrons replaced by PS II)

[noncyclic photophos]

Cyclic vs Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation

-   Cyclic photophosphorylation can be used to produce a steady supply
    of ATP in the presence of sunlight
-   However, ATP is a highly reactive molecule and hence cannot be
    readily stored within the cell
-   Non-cyclic photophosphorylation produces NADPH in addition to ATP
    (this requires the presence of water)
-   Both NADPH and ATP are required to produce organic molecules via the
    light independent reactions
-   Hence, only non-cyclic photophosphorylation allows for the synthesis
    of organic molecules and long term energy storage

The key differences between cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation
are summarised in the table below:

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Light dependent reactions take place in the intermembrane space of
the thylakoids

â€¢ Â Light independent reactions take place in the stroma

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthesis is the process by which cells synthesise organic
molecules (e.g. glucose) from inorganic molecules (CO₂ and H₂O) in the
presence of sunlight
This process requires a photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll) and can
only occur in certain organisms (plants, some bacteria)

-   In plants, photosynthesis occurs within a specialised organelle
    called theÂ chloroplast

Photosynthesis Equation

[photosynthesis equation]

Photosynthesis is a two step process:

-   The light dependent reactions convert light energy from the Sun into
    chemical energy (ATP)
-   The light independent reactions use the chemical energy to
    synthesise organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates)

Step 1:Â Â Light Dependent Reactions

-   Light is absorbed by chlorophyll, which releases energised electrons
    that are used to produce ATP (chemical energy)
-   The electrons are donated to carrier molecules (NADP⁺), which is
    used (along with ATP) in the light independent reactionsÂ 
-   The electrons lost from the chlorophyll are replaced by water, which
    is split (photolysis) to produce oxygen and hydrogen
-   The light dependent reactions occur in the intermembraneÂ space of
    membranous discs called thylakoids

Step 2:Â Â Light Independent Reactions

-   ATP and hydrogen / electrons (carried by NADPH) are transferred to
    the site of the light independent reactions
-   The hydrogen / electrons are combined with carbon dioxide to form
    complex organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates)
-   The ATP provides the required energy to power these anabolic
    reactions and fix the carbon molecules together
-   The light independent reactions occur within the fluid-filled
    interior of the chloroplast called the stroma

Overview of the Two Stages of Photosynthesis

[photosynthesis reactions]
Photosynthesis vs Respiration

In many respects, photosynthesis and cell respiration are complementary
reactions within the environment

-   The products of photosynthesis function as the inputs of cell
    respiration (oxygen and glucose)
-   The products of cell respiration function as the inputs of
    photosynthesis (carbon dioxide and water)

Most producers (i.e. photoautotrophs) undertake both photosynthesis and
cell respiration to survive

-   Consumers (i.e. heterotrophs) only undertake cell respiration, but
    will ingest or absorb photosynthetic products

Interrelationship Between Processes

[photo vs resp]

Similarities

Photosynthesis and cell respiration both involve the production of
chemical energy (ATP)

-   In photosynthesis, ATP is produced via light energy
    (photophosphorylation) and used to make organic molecules
-   In cellÂ respiration, ATP is produced by breaking down organic
    molecules (oxidative phosphorylation)

In both cases, the production of ATP involves an electron transport
chain and chemiosmosis

-   In photosynthesis, electrons are donated by chlorophyll and protons
    accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoid
-   In cell respiration, electrons are donated by hydrogen carriers and
    protons accumulate in the intermembrane space

Comparison of ATP Production

[photo vs resp similar]

Differences

Photosynthesis and cell respiration are in many respects the reverse of
one another

-   Photosynthesis is an anabolic process, whereas cell respiration is a
    catabolic process

Photosynthesis:

-   Water is broken down to oxygen to release electrons for an electron
    transport chain
-   Electrons from the transport chain are taken up by hydrogen carriers
    (NADPH specifically)
-   Uses the Calvin cycle to synthesise glucose (requires hydrogen
    carriers and carbon dioxide)

Cell Respiration:

-   Uses the Krebs cycle to break down glucose (releases hydrogen
    carriers and carbon dioxide
-   Hydrogen carriers release electrons for an electron transport chain
    (NADH and FADH₂ specifically)
-   Electrons from the transport chain are taken up by oxygen (to form
    water)

Activation Energy

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes lower the activation energy of the chemical reactions that
they catalyse

Â  Â Â 
Every chemical reaction requires a certain amount of energy in order to
proceed â€“ this is the activation energy (E_(A))

-   Enzymes speed up the rate of a biochemical reaction by lowering the
    activation energy
-   When an enzyme binds to a substrate it stresses and destabilises the
    bonds in the substrate
-   This reduces the overall energy level of the substrateâ€™s
    transitionary state, meaning less energy is needed to convert it
    into a product and the reaction proceeds at a faster rate

Activation Energy

[activation energy]

Types of Enzymatic Reactions

If the reactants contain more energy than the products, the free energy
is released into the system (exergonic)

-   These reactions are usually catabolic (breaking down), as energy is
    released from broken bonds within a molecule

If the reactants contain less energy than the products, free energy is
lost to the system (endergonic)

-   These reactions are usually anabolic (building up), as energy is
    required to synthesise bonds between molecules

Reaction Pathways of an Exergonic and Endergonic Process

[exergonic vs endergonic]
Allosterism

Allosteric regulation (allosterism) is the modulation of an enzymeâ€™s
activity via the binding of an effector molecule (ligand) to a site
other than the enzymeâ€™s active site (an allosteric site)

-   Allosteric binding causes a conformational change in the enzymeâ€™s
    structure which affects the enzymeâ€™s affinity for substrate
-   Allosteric regulation can be either positive (activation) or
    negative (non-competitive inhibition)

Positive Allosterism

-   An example of allosteric activation is seen in the binding of oxygen
    molecules to haemoglobin
-   Haemoglobin is composed of four distinct subunits and can bind up to
    four oxygen molecules (HbO₈)
-   As each oxygen molecule binds, it changes the conformation of
    haemoglobin and increases its affinity for oxygen
-   This ensures that haemoglobin will transport the maximum amount of
    oxygen from oxygen-rich areas (i.e. the lungs)
-   Conversely, the release of an O₂ molecule decreases haemoglobinâ€™s
    affinity for oxygen â€“ promoting its release in the tissues

Negative Allosterism

-   An example of allosteric inhibition can be seen in any example of
    non-competitive inhibition
-   Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of
    glucose during glycolysis (to make ATP)
-   ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK and inhibits its activity â€“
    preventing glycolysis from occurring
-   Thus ATP prevents the further production of more ATP when energy
    stocks are high (end-product inhibition)
-   When energy stocks are low, there is insufficient ATP to inhibit PFK
    and glycolysis will be able to proceed

Enzyme Inhibition

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzyme inhibitors can be competitive or non-competitive

Â  Â Â 
An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that disrupts the normal reaction
pathway between an enzyme and a substrate

-   Enzyme inhibitors can be either competitive or non-competitive
    depending on their mechanism of action

Types of Enzyme Inhibition

Enzyme inhibitors prevent the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex
and hence prevent the formation of product

-   Inhibition of enzymes may be either reversible or irreversible
    depending on the specific effect of the inhibitor being used

Normal Enzyme Reaction

-   In a normal reaction, a substrate binds to an enzyme (via the active
    site) to form an enzyme-substrate complex
-   The shape and properties of the substrate and active site are
    complementary, resulting in enzyme-substrate specificity
-   When binding occurs, the active site undergoes a conformational
    change to optimally interact with the substrate (induced fit)
-   This conformational change destabilises chemical bonds within the
    substrate, lowering the activation energy
-   As a consequence of enzyme interaction, the substrate is converted
    into product at an accelerated rate

[enzyme reaction]

Competitive Inhibition

-   Competitive inhibition involves a molecule, other than the
    substrate, binding to the enzymeâ€™s active site
-   The molecule (inhibitor) is structurally and chemically similar to
    the substrate (hence able to bind to the active site)
-   The competitive inhibitor blocks the active site and thus prevents
    substrate binding
-   As the inhibitor is in competition with the substrate, its effects
    can be reduced by increasing substrate concentration

[competitive inhibition]

Noncompetitive Inhibition

-   Non-competitive inhibition involves a molecule binding to a site
    other than the active site (an allosteric site)
-   The binding of the inhibitor to the allosteric site causes a
    conformational change to the enzymeâ€™s active site
-   As a result of this change, the active site and substrate no longer
    share specificity, meaning the substrate cannot bind
-   As the inhibitor is not in direct competition with the substrate,
    increasing substrate levels cannot mitigate the inhibitorâ€™s effect

[noncompetitive inhibition]

Examples of Enzyme Inhibition

Enzyme inhibitors can serve a variety of purposes, including in medicine
(to treat disease) and agriculture (as pesticides)

-   An example of a use for a competitive inhibitor is in the treatment
    of influenza via the neuraminidase inhibitor, Relenza^(TM)Â 
-   An example of a use for a non-competitive inhibitor is in the use of
    cyanide as a poison (prevents aerobic respiration)

Relenza (Competitive Inhibitor)

-   Relenza is a synthetic drug designed by Australian scientists to
    treat individuals infected with the influenza virus
-   Virions are released from infected cells when the viral enzyme
    neuraminidase cleaves a docking protein (haemagglutinin)
-   Relenza competitively binds to the neuraminidase active site and
    prevents the cleavage of the docking protein
-   Consequently, virions are not released from infected cells,
    preventing the spread of the influenza virus

Cyanide (Noncompetitive Inhibitor)

-   Cyanide is a poison which prevents ATP production via aerobic
    respiration, leading to eventual death
-   It binds to an allosteric site on cytochrome oxidase â€“ a carrier
    molecule that forms part of the electron transport chain
-   By changing the shape of the active site, cytochrome oxidase can no
    longer pass electrons to the final acceptor (oxygen)
-   Consequently, the electron transport chain cannot continue to
    function and ATP is not produced via aerobic respiration

Skill:

â€¢ Â Calculating and plotting rates of reaction from raw experimental
results

Â  Â Â 
The rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction can be calculated and plotted
according to the time taken for the reaction to proceed

-   The time taken can be measured according to either the amount of
    product formed or the amount of substrate consumed
-   Reaction rate is the inverse of time taken, meaning that the
    reaction rate is higher when less time is taken (and vice versa)

The rate of reaction can be calculated according to the following
formula:

-   Rate of reaction (s^(â€“1)) = 1 / time taken (s)

Factors which can influence the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction
include temperature, pH and substrate concentration

Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

[enzyme rates]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Distinguishing different types of inhibition from graphs at
specified substrate concentrations

Â  Â Â 
Competitive and non-competitive inhibitors effect the kinetics of an
enzyme-catalysed reaction in different ways:

-   Both reduce the rate of reaction by limiting the amount of
    uninhibited enzyme available for reaction

Competitive Inhibitors

-   Bind directly to the active site and hence exist in direct
    competition with the substrate
-   Increasing substrate levels will increase the likelihood of the
    enzyme colliding with the substrate instead of the inhibitor
-   The maximum rate of enzyme activity (Vmax) can still be achieved,
    although it requires a higher substrate concentration

Noncompetitive Inhibitors

-   Bind to an allosteric site and hence do not exist in direct
    competition with the substrate
-   Increasing substrate concentrations will not effect the level of
    inhibition caused by the non-competitive inhibitor
-   The maximum rate of enzyme activity (Vmax) is therefore reduced

Feedback Inhibition

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Metabolic pathways can be controlled by end-product inhibition

Â  Â Â 
End-product inhibition (or feedback inhibition) is a form of negative
feedback by which metabolic pathways can be controlled

-   In end-product inhibition, the final product in a series of
    reactions inhibits an enzyme from an earlier step in the sequence
-   The product binds to an allosteric site and temporarily inactivates
    the enzyme (via non-competitive inhibition)
-   As the enzyme can no longer function, the reaction sequence is
    halted and the rate of product formation is decreased

End-product inhibition functions to ensure levels of an essential
product are always tightly regulated

-   If product levels build up, the product inhibits the reaction
    pathway and hence decreases the rate of further product formation
-   If product levels drop, the reaction pathway will proceed unhindered
    and the rate of product formation will increase

End-Product Inhibition

[feedback inhibition]

Â 

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â End-product inhibition of the pathway that converts threonine to
isoleucine

Â  Â Â 
Isoleucine is an essential amino acid, meaning it is not synthesised by
the body in humans (and hence must be ingested)

-   Food sources rich in isoleucine include eggs, seaweed, fish, cheese,
    chicken and lamb

In plants and bacteria, isoleucine may be synthesised from threonine in
a five-step reaction pathway

-   In the first step of this process, threonine is converted into an
    intermediate compound by an enzyme (threonine deaminase)
-   Isoleucine can bind to an allosteric site on this enzyme and
    function as a non-competitive inhibitor

As excess production of isoleucine inhibits further synthesis, it
functions as an example of end-product inhibition

-   This feedback inhibition ensures that isoleucine production does not
    cannibalise available stocks of threonine

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Metabolic pathways consist of chains and cycles of
enzyme-catalysed reactions

Â  Â Â 
Metabolism describes the sum total of all reactions that occur within an
organism in order to maintain life

-   Most chemical changes in a cell result from a series of reactions
    (pathways), with each step controlled by a specific enzyme
-   Metabolic pathways allow for a greater level of regulation, as the
    chemical change is controlled by numerous intermediates

Metabolic pathways are typically organised into chains or cycles of
enzyme-catalysed reactions

-   Examples of chains: Â Glycolysis (in cell respiration), coagulation
    cascade (in blood clotting)
-   Examples of cycles: Â Krebs cycle (in cell respiration), Calvin
    cycle (in photosynthesis)

Types of Metabolic Pathways

[metabolic pathways]
Models of Action

There are two models used to describe the way enzymes interact with
substrates:

-   The 'lock and keyâ€™Â model
-   TheÂ â€˜induced fitâ€™Â model

The Lock and Key Model

According to the lock and key model, the enzymeâ€™s active site
complements the substrate precisely

The substrate fits a particular active site like a key fits into a
particular lock

This theory of enzyme-substrate interaction explains how enzymes
exhibitÂ specificityÂ for a particular substrate

[]

The Induced Fit Model

According to the induced fit model, the enzymeâ€™s active site is not a
completely rigid fit for the substrate

Instead, the active site will undergo aÂ conformational changeÂ when
exposed to a substrate to improve binding

This theory of enzyme-substrate interactions has two advantages compared
to the lock and key model:

-   It explains how enzymes may exhibitÂ broad specificityÂ (e.g. lipase
    can bind to a variety of lipids)
-   It explains how catalysis may occur (the conformational change
    stresses bonds in the substrate, increasing reactivity)

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of databases to identify potential new anti-malarial drugs

Â  Â Â 
Malaria is a disease caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus
Plasmodium

-   The life cycle of the parasite requires both a human and mosquito
    host â€“ hence the disease is transmitted via mosquito bites
-   The maturation and development of the parasite in both human and
    mosquito host is coordinated by specific enzymes
-   By targeting these enzymes for inhibition, new anti-malarial drugs
    and medications can be produced

Scientists have sequenced the genome of infectious species of Plasmodium
and used it to determine the parasiteâ€™s proteome

-   From the proteome, enzymes involved in parasitic metabolism have
    been identified as potential targets for inhibition

These enzymes may be screened against a bioinformaticÂ database of
chemicals to identify potential enzyme inhibitors

-   Once a promising compound is identified, it may be chemically
    modified to improve its binding affinity and lower its toxicity
-   In one particular study, over 300,000 chemicals were screened to
    identify 19 new chemicals that might function as inhibitorsÂ 

An alternative method by which potential new anti-malarial medications
can be synthesised is via rational drug design

-   Rational drug design involves using computer modelling techniques to
    invent a compound that will function as an inhibitor
-   Using combinatorial chemistry, a compound is synthesised that is
    complementary to the active site of the target enzyme

Yeast-2-Hybrid System

The yeast-2-hybrid system is a simple scientific technique used to
screen a library of proteins for potential interactions

-   Firstly, a transcription factor is broken into two parts â€“ a
    DNA-binding domain (BD) and a catalytic activation domain (AD)
-   The DNA-binding domain is fused to a protein of interest called the
    bait (e.g. an enzyme)
-   The activation domain is fused to a number of potential binding
    partners â€“ called the prey (e.g. different ligands)
-   If the bait and prey interact, the two parts of the transcription
    factor are reconstituted and activate transcription of a gene
-   If the bait and prey do not interact, the two parts of the
    transcription factor remain separate and transcription doesnâ€™t
    occur

The yeast-2-hybrid system detects protein-protein interactions according
to the activation of a reporter gene

-   The reporter gene may encode for the production of a protein that
    causes a visible colour change (e.g. ÃŸ-galactosidase)
-   Alternatively, the reporter gene may encode for the production of an
    essential amino acid that is required for the yeast to grow on a
    deficient media (hence yeast growth would indicate successful
    interaction between bait and prey)

Yeast-2-hybrid screens are a simple technique and hence have a
relatively high rate of false positives (partial interactions)

-   Consequently, the yeast-2-hybrid system is typically only used as an
    initial test to identify possible protein interactionsÂ

Â  Â Â reactions occur

Â  Â Â 
Aerobic respiration involves the breakdown of glucose in the presence of
oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide

-   It requires the involvement of mitochondria and generates a large
    yield of ATP (typically 36 ATP per glucose consumed)
-   Aerobic respiration may include the following processes:
    Â glycolysis, link reaction, krebs cycle, electron transport chain

Aerobic Respiration Equation

[respiration equation]

Types of Aerobic Reactions

Aerobic respiration involves three main types of reactions â€“
decarboxylation, oxidation and phosphorylation

-   The following table organises these reactions according to the
    different stages of aerobic respiration

[aerobic respiration table]

Decarboxylation:

-   Carbon atoms are removed from the organic molecule (glucose) to form
    carbon dioxide
-   Aerobic respiration involves the complete combustion of glucose (6C)
    â€“ so six CO₂ molecules are produced

Oxidation:

-   Electrons and hydrogen ions are removed from glucose and taken up by
    hydrogen carriers (NADH and FADH₂)
-   The hydrogen carriers are in turn oxidised at the electron transport
    chain (where the energy is used to make ATP)
-   The electrons and hydrogen ions are then taken up by oxygen
    (reduction) to form water molecules
-   Twelve hydrogen carriers are produced and so six oxygen molecules
    are required (12Â Ã— O = 6Â Ã— O₂)

Phosphorylation:

-   Energy released from the breakdown of glucose is used to
    phosphorylate ADP to make ATP
-   A net total of four ATP molecules are produced directly via
    substrate level phosphorylation
-   The remaining ATP is produced indirectly via the electron transport
    chain (oxidative phosphorylation)

Aerobic respiration typically produces a net total of 36 ATP per
molecule of glucose consumed

-   A net total of 2 ATP are produced in glycolysis via substrate level
    phosphorylation (four are produced, but two are consumed)
-   A further 2 ATP are similarly produced in the Krebs cycle (one ATP
    per cycle â€“ two cycles occur per glucose molecule)
-   Lastly, 32 ATP are produced in the electron transport chain using
    energy from hydrogen carriers (oxidative phosphorylation)

Hydrogen carriers produce different amounts of ATP depending on where
they donate electrons to the transport chain

-   NADH molecules located in the matrix donate electrons to the start
    of the chain and produce 3 ATP per hydrogen carrier
-   Cytosolic NADH (from glycolysis) donate electrons later in the chain
    and only produce 2 ATP per hydrogen carrier
-   FADH₂ also donates electrons later in the chain and so only produce
    2 ATP per hydrogen carrier

Oxidative phosphorylation: Â (8Â Ã— matrix NADH) + (2Â Ã— cytosolic
NADH) + (2Â Ã— FADH₂) Â = Â (8Â Ã— 3) + (2Â Ã— 2) + (2Â Ã— 2) Â = Â 32

Anaerobic versus Aerobic Respiration

Both aerobic and anaerobic respiration uses the oxidation of organic
molecules to synthesis ATP
However there are several key differences between the two processes,
including:

-   Overall energy yield
-   Products formed
-   Location of processes

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Transfer of electrons between carriers in the electron transport
chain in the membrane of the cristae is

Â  Â Â coupled to proton pumping

Â  Â Â 
The final stage of aerobic respiration is the electron transport chain,
which is located on the inner mitochondrial membraneÂ 

-   The inner membrane is arranged into folds (cristae), which increases
    the surface area available for the transport chain

The electron transport chain releases the energy stored within the
reduced hydrogen carriers in order to synthesise ATP

-   This is called oxidative phosphorylation, as the energy to
    synthesise ATP is derived from the oxidation of hydrogen carriers

Oxidative phosphorylation occurs over a number of distinct steps:

-   Proton pumps create an electrochemical gradient (proton motive
    force)
-   ATP synthase uses the subsequent diffusion of protons (chemiosmosis)
    to synthesise ATP
-   Oxygen accepts electrons and protons to form water

Step 1: Â Generating a Proton Motive Force

-   The hydrogen carriers (NADH and FADH₂) are oxidised and release high
    energy electrons and protons
-   The electrons are transferred to the electron transport chain, which
    consists of several transmembrane carrier proteins
-   As electrons pass through the chain, they lose energy â€“ which is
    used by the chain to pump protons (H⁺ ions) from the matrix
-   The accumulation of H⁺ ions within the intermembrane space creates
    an electrochemical gradient (or a proton motive force)

[ETC1]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In chemiosmosis protons diffuse through ATP synthase to generate
ATP

Â  Â  Â 

Step Two: Â ATP Synthesis via Chemiosmosis

-   The proton motive force will cause H⁺ ions to move down their
    electrochemical gradient and diffuse back into matrix
-   This diffusion of protons is called chemiosmosis and is facilitated
    by the transmembrane enzyme ATP synthase
-   As the H⁺ ions move through ATP synthase they trigger the molecular
    rotation of the enzyme, synthesising ATP

[ETC2]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Oxygen is needed to bind with the free protons to maintain the
hydrogen gradient, resulting in the formation

Â  Â Â of water

Â  Â Â 

Step Three: Â Reduction of Oxygen

-   In order for the electron transport chain to continue functioning,
    the de-energised electrons must be removed
-   Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, removing the
    de-energised electrons to prevent the chain from becoming blocked
-   Oxygen also binds with free protons in the matrix to form water â€“
    removing matrix protons maintains the hydrogen gradient
-   In the absence of oxygen, hydrogen carriers cannot transfer
    energised electrons to the chain and ATP production is halted

[ETC3]

Summary: Â Oxidative Phosphorylation

-   Hydrogen carriers donate high energy electrons to the electron
    transport chain (located on the cristae)
-   As the electrons move through the chain they lose energy, which is
    transferred to the electron carriers within the chain
-   The electron carriers use this energy to pump hydrogen ions from the
    matrix and into the intermembrane space
-   The accumulation of H⁺ ions in the intermembrane space creates an
    electrochemical gradient (or a proton motive force)
-   H⁺ ions return to the matrix via the transmembrane enzyme ATP
    synthase (this diffusion of ions is called chemiosmosis)
-   As the ions pass through ATP synthase they trigger a phosphorylation
    reaction which produces ATP (from ADP + Pi)
-   The de-energised electrons are removed from the chain by oxygen,
    allowing new high energy electrons to enter the chain
-   Oxygen also binds matrix protons to form water â€“ this maintains
    the hydrogen gradient by removing H⁺ ions from the matrix

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Phosphorylation of molecules makes them less stable

Â  Â 
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a high energy molecule that functions as
an immediate power source for cells

-   One molecule of ATP contains three covalently bonded phosphate
    groups â€“ which store potential energy in their bonds
-   Phosphorylation makes molecules less stable and hence ATP is a
    readily reactive molecule that contains high energy bonds
-   When ATP is hydrolysed (to form ADP + Pi), the energy stored in the
    terminal phosphate bond is released for use by the cell

Relationship between ATP and ADP

[ATP-ADP]

ATP has two key functions within the cell:

-   It functions as the energy currency of the cell by releasing energy
    when hydrolysed to ADPÂ (powers cell metabolism)Â 
-   It may transfer the released phosphate group to other organic
    molecules, rendering them less stable and more reactive

ATP is synthesised from ADP using energy derived from one of two
sources:

-   Solar energy â€“ photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical
    energy that is stored as ATP
-   Oxidative processes â€“ cell respiration breaks down organic
    molecules to release chemical energy that is stored as ATP

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cell respiration involves the oxidation and reduction of electron
carriers

Â 
Cell respiration is the controlled release of energy from organic
compounds to produce ATP

-   Anaerobic respiration involves the incomplete breakdown of organic
    molecules for a small yield of ATP (no oxygen required)
-   Aerobic respiration involves the complete breakdown of organic
    molecules for a larger yield of ATP (oxygen is required)

The breakdown of organic molecules occurs via a number of linked
processes that involve a number of discrete steps

-   By staggering the breakdown, the energy requirements are reduced
    (activation energy can be divided across several steps)
-   The released energy is not lost â€“ it is transferred to activated
    carrier molecules via redox reactions (oxidation / reduction)

Energy Conversions in Sugar Breakdown (Direct Combustion vs Cell
Respiration)

[sugar breakdown]

Redox Reactions

When organic molecules are broken down by cell respiration, the chemical
energy is transferred by means of redox reactions

-   Redox reactions involved the reduction of one chemical species and
    the oxidation of another (redox = reduction / oxidation)

Most redox reactions typically involve the transfer of electrons,
hydrogen or oxygenÂ 

-   Reduction is the gain of electrons / hydrogen or the loss of oxygen
-   Oxidation is the loss of electrons / hydrogen or the gain of oxygen

Redox reactions can be summarised according to the following table:

[redox table]

Redox Mnemonics

Redox reactions involving electrons can be remembered using any of the
following mnemonics:

-   OIL RIG Â â€“ Â Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons) ; Reduction Is Gain
    (of electrons)
-   LEO goes GER Â â€“ Â Loss of Electrons is Oxidation ; Gain of
    Electrons is Reduction
-   ELMO Â â€“ Â Electron Loss Means Oxidation

[redox mnemonics]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Energy released by oxidation reactions is carried to the cristae
of the mitochondria by reduced NAD and FAD

Â Â 
Cell respiration breaks down organic molecules and transfers hydrogen
atoms and electrons to carrier molecules

-   As the organic molecule is losing hydrogen atoms and electrons, this
    is an oxidation reaction
-   Energy stored in the organic molecule is transferred with the
    protons and electrons to the carrier molecules

The carrier molecules are called hydrogen carriers or electron carriers,
as they gain electrons and protons (H⁺ ions)

-   The most common hydrogen carrier is NAD⁺ which is reduced to form
    NADH Â (NAD⁺ + 2H⁺ + 2e^(â€“) Â â†’Â Â NADH + H⁺)
-   A less common hydrogen carrier is FAD which is reduced to form FADH₂
    Â (FADÂ + 2H⁺Â + 2e^(â€“)Â Â â†’Â  FADH₂)

The hydrogen carriers function like taxis, transporting the electrons
(and hydrogen ions) to the cristae of the mitochondria

-   The cristae is the site of the electron transport chain, which uses
    the energy transferred by the carriers to synthesize ATP
-   This process requires oxygen to function, and hence only aerobic
    respiration can generate ATP from hydrogen carriers
-   This is why aerobic respiration unlocks more of the energy stored in
    the organic molecules and produces more ATP

Energy Transfer via Hydrogen Carriers

Energy Sources

Cell respiration is typically explained according to the oxidation of a
carbohydrate (glucose), however lipids and proteins can also be used as
energy sources
Carbohydrates are preferable as a ready-made energy source because:Â 

-   They are easier to transport and digest (unlike lipids)Â 
-   They donâ€™t produce nitrogenous wastes (unlike proteins)

Destination

-   Carbohydrates can be broken down into monosaccharides (e.g.
    glucose), which are able to be used in glycolysis
-   Lipids (i.e. triglycerides) can be broken down into glycerol and
    fatty acids (beta oxidation), which are able to be converted into
    acetyl CoA and used in the Krebs cycle (aerobic respiration only)
-   Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which are also capable
    of being converted into intermediates of the Krebs cycle and used in
    aerobic respiration

Energy Content

-   Lipids produce roughly twice as much energy (~4000 kJ per 100 g) as
    proteins and carbohydrates
-   Both proteins (~1,720 kJ per 100 g)Â and carbohydrates (~1,760 kJ
    per 100 g)Â produce similar levels of energyÂ

Glycolysis

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate in the cytoplasm

Â  Â Â 
The main organic compound used in cell respiration is carbohydrates
(glucose) â€“ although lipids and proteins can be used

-   Lipids are not preferentially used as they are harder to transport
    and digest (although will yield more energy per gram)
-   Proteins are not preferentially used as they release potentially
    toxic nitrogenous compounds when broken down

The first step in the controlled breakdown of carbohydrates is
glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol of the cell

-   In glycolysis, a hexose sugar (6C) is broken down into two molecules
    of pyruvate (3C)

The process of glycolysis involves many intermediate steps, but can be
summarised by four key events:

1. Â Phosphorylation

-   A hexose sugar (typically glucose) is phosphorylated by two
    molecules of ATP (to form a hexose bisphosphate)
-   This phosphorylation makes the molecule less stable and more
    reactive, and also prevents diffusion out of the cellÂ 

2. Â Lysis

-   The hexose biphosphate (6C sugar) is split into two triose
    phosphates (3C sugars)

3. Â Oxidation

-   Hydrogen atoms are removed from each of the 3C sugars (via
    oxidation) to reduce NAD⁺ to NADH (+ H⁺)
-   Two molecules of NADH are produced in total (one from each 3C sugar)

4. Â ATP formation

-   Some of the energy released from the sugar intermediates is used to
    directly synthesise ATP
-   This direct synthesis of ATP is called substrate level
    phosphorylation
-   In total, 4 molecules of ATP are generated during glycolysis by
    substrate level phosphorylation (2 ATP per 3C sugar)

At the end of glycolysis, the following reactions have occurred:

-   Glucose (6C) has been broken down into two molecules of pyruvate
    (3C)
-   Two hydrogen carriers have been reduced via oxidation (2Â Ã—Â NADH +
    H⁺)
-   A net total of two ATP molecules have been produced (4 molecules
    were generated, but 2 were used)

Overview of Glycolysis

[glycolysis]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Glycolysis gives a small net gain of ATP without the use of oxygen

Â  Â Â 
Glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate (Ã— 2), with
a small net gain of ATP (two molecules)

-   Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol and does not require oxygen (it is
    an anaerobic process)

Depending on the availability of oxygen, the pyruvate may be subjected
to one of two alternative processes:

-   Aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen and results in
    the further production of ATP (~ 34 molecules)
-   Anaerobic respiration (fermentation) occurs in the absence of oxygen
    and no further ATP is produced

Aerobic Respiration

-   If oxygen is present, the pyruvate is transported to the
    mitochondria for further breakdown (complete oxidation)
-   This further oxidation generates large numbers of reduced hydrogen
    carriers (NADH + H⁺ and FADH₂)
-   In the presence of oxygen, the reduced hydrogen carriers can release
    their stored energy to synthesise more ATP
-   Aerobic respiration involves three additional processes â€“ the link
    reaction, krebs cycle and the electron transport chain

Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation)

-   If oxygen is not present, pyruvate is not broken down further and no
    more ATP is produced (incomplete oxidation)
-   The pyruvate remains in the cytosol and is converted into lactic
    acid (animals) or ethanol and CO₂ (plants and yeast)
-   This conversion is reversible and is necessary to ensure that
    glycolysis can continue to produce small quantities of ATP
    -   Glycolysis involves oxidation reactions that cause hydrogen
        carriers (NAD⁺) to be reduced (becomes NADH + H⁺)
    -   Typically, the reduced hydrogen carriers are oxidised via
        aerobic respiration to restore available stocks of NAD⁺
    -   In the absence of oxygen, glycolysis will quickly deplete
        available stocks of NAD⁺, preventing further glycolysis
    -   Fermentation of pyruvate involves a reduction reaction that
        oxidises NADH (releasing NAD⁺Â to restore available stocks)
    -   Hence, anaerobic respiration allows small amounts of ATP to be
        produced (via glycolysis) in the absence of oxygen

-   Cell respiration involves the oxidation and reduction of electron
    carriers
-   Phosphorylation of molecules makes them less stable
-   In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate in the cytoplasm
-   Glycolysis gives a small net gain of ATP without the use of oxygen
-   In aerobic cell respiration pyruvate is decarboxylated
    andÂ oxidised, and converted intoÂ acetyl compound and attached to
    coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A in the link reaction

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In the Krebs cycle, the oxidation of acetyl groups is coupled to
the reduction of hydrogen carriers, liberating

Â  Â Â carbon dioxide

Â  Â Â 
The second stage of aerobic respiration is the Krebs cycle, which occurs
within the matrix of the mitochondria

-   The Krebs cycle is also commonly referred to as the citric acid
    cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle

In the Krebs cycle, acetyl CoA transfers its acetyl group to a 4C
compound (oxaloacetate) to make a 6C compound (citrate)

-   Coenzyme A is released and can return to the link reaction to form
    another molecule of acetyl CoA

Over a series of reactions, the 6C compound is broken down to reform the
original 4C compound (hence, a cycle)

-   Two carbon atoms are released via decarboxylation to form two
    molecules of carbon dioxide (CO₂)
-   Multiple oxidation reactions result in the reduction of hydrogen
    carriers (3Â Ã— NADH + H⁺ ; 1Â Ã— FADH₂)
-   One molecule of ATP is produced directly via substrate level
    phosphorylation

As the link reaction produces two molecules of acetyl CoA (one per each
pyruvate), the Krebs cycle occurs twice

-   Per glucose molecule, the Krebs cycle produces: Â 4Â Ã— CO₂ Â ;
    Â 2Â Ã— ATP Â ; Â 6Â Ã— NADH + H⁺ Â ; Â 2Â Ã— FADH₂

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In aerobic cell respiration pyruvate is decarboxylated and
oxidised, and converted into acetyl compound and

Â  Â Â attached to coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A in the link
reaction

Â  Â Â 
The first stage of aerobic respiration is the link reaction, which
transports pyruvate into the mitochondria

-   Aerobic respiration uses available oxygen to further oxidise the
    sugar molecule for a greater yield of ATP

The link reaction is named thus because it links the products of
glycolysis with the aerobic processes of the mitochondria

-   Pyruvate is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial
    matrix by carrier proteins on the mitochondrial membrane
-   The pyruvate loses a carbon atom (decarboxylation), which forms a
    carbon dioxide molecule
-   The 2C compound then forms an acetyl group when it loses hydrogen
    atoms via oxidation (NAD⁺ is reduced to NADH + H⁺)
-   The acetyl compound then combines with coenzyme A to form acetyl
    coenzyme A (acetyl CoA)

As glycolysis splits glucose into two pyruvate molecules, the link
reaction occurs twice per molecule of glucose

-   Per glucose molecule, the link reaction produces acetyl CoA (Ã—2),
    NADH + H⁺ (Ã—2) and CO₂ (Ã—2)

Mitochondria

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The structure of the mitochondrion is adapted to the function it
performs

Â  Â 
Mitochondria are theÂ â€˜powerplantsâ€™Â of the cell â€“ synthesising
large amounts of ATP via aerobic respiration

-   All eukaryotic cells possess mitochondria â€“ aerobic prokaryotes
    use the cell membrane to perform oxidative phosphorylation

Mitochondria are thought to have once been independent prokaryotes that
were internalised by eukaryotes via endosymbiosis

-   They have a double membrane structure (due to vesicular coating as
    part of the endocytotic process)
-   They have their own DNA (circular and naked) and ribosomes (70S)
-   Their metabolic processes are susceptible to certain antibiotics

The structure of the mitochondrion is adapted to the function it
performs:

-   Outer membrane â€“ the outer membrane contains transport proteins
    that enable the shuttling of pyruvate from the cytosol
-   Inner membrane â€“ contains the electron transport chain and ATP
    synthase (used for oxidative phosphorylation)Â 
-   Cristae â€“ the inner membrane is arranged into folds (cristae) that
    increase the SA:Vol ratio (more available surface)
-   Intermembrane space â€“ small space between membranes maximises
    hydrogen gradient upon proton accumulation
-   Matrix â€“ central cavity that contains appropriate enzymes and a
    suitable pH for the Krebs cycle to occur

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram of a mitochondrion to indicate the
adaptations to its function

Â  Â 
Electron micrographs of a mitochondrion may differ in appearance
depending on where the cross-section occurs

Typically, mitochondrial diagrams should display the following features:

-   Usually sausage-shaped in appearance (though will appear more
    rounded in perpendicular cross-sections)
-   Inner membrane contains many internal protrusions (cristae)
-   Intermembrane space is very small (allows for a more rapid
    generation of a proton motive force)
-   Ribosomes and mitochondrial DNA are usually not visible at standard
    resolutions and magnifications

Application:

â€¢ Â Electron tomography used to produce images of active mitochondria

Â  Â  Â 
Electron tomography is a technique by which the 3-dimensional internal
structure of a sample can be modelled

-   Samples are repeatedly imaged using a transmission electron
    microscope
-   Following each image, the sample is tilted to a different angle
    relative to the electron beam
-   The images are then compiled and used to computationally reconstruct
    a 3-D representation (called a tomogram)

When dealing with biological materials, samples are first prepared by
either fixing and dehydrating or freezing (cryogenics)

-   This stabilises the biological structures and prevents aqueous
    contents (i.e. water) from expanding and exploding

Using electron tomography, the following features of active mitochondria
have been identified:

-   The cristae are continuous with the internal mitochondrial membrane
-   The intermembrane space is of a consistent width thoughout the
    entire mitochondrion
-   The relative shape, position and volume of the cristae can change in
    active mitochondria

Overview of Electron Tomography

Phosphagen System

Phosphagens are energy storing compounds that are chiefly found in
muscle and nervous tissue in animals

-   They function as an immediate access reserve of high energy
    phosphates that can be used to make ATP
-   Phosphagens are found in tissues that experience rapidly changing
    energy needs (muscles and nerves)

A common phosphagen used by animals (including humans) is
phosphocreatine (or creatine phosphate â€“ CP)

-   At rest, ATP is hydrolysed to ADP and the phosphate is transferred
    to creatine to make phosphocreatine
    -   This occurs in the mitochondria, where ATP levels are high (thus
        driving the reaction)
-   During exercise, phosphocreatine is hydrolysed and the phosphate is
    released to make ATP from ADP
    -   This occurs in the muscles, where ADP levels will be high (thus
        driving the reaction)

ATPâ€“CP Cycle

[ATP-CP cycle]

Energy Systems

Phosphocreatine synthesises a pool of ATP more rapidly than cell
respiration, but reserves are quickly depleted

-   The phosphagen system will be used for the first 10 â€“ 12 seconds
    of intense exercise (e.g. a sprinter)

Anaerobic respiration provides a more sustained pool of ATP, but
produces lactic acid as a by-product

-   Anaerobic respiration (i.e. glycolysis) will be used for the first 1
    â€“ 2 minutes of exercise (e.g. 400 m swimmer)

Aerobic respiration requires a constant supply of oxygen, but can
produce a large yield of ATP

-   Aerobic respiration will be used for long-distance and less intense
    exercise activities (e.g. marathons)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mitosis and cell division in the shoot apex provide cells needed
for extension of the stem and development

Â  Â Â of leaves

Â  Â Â 
The apical meristems give rise to primary growth (lengthening) and
occurs at the tips of the roots and shoots

-   Growth at these regions is due to a combination of cell enlargement
    and repeated cell division (mitosis and cytokinesis)
-   Differentiation of the dividing meristem gives rise to a variety of
    stem tissues and structures â€“ including leaves and flowers

In the stem, growth occurs in sections called nodes â€“ with the
remaining meristem tissue forming an inactive axillary bud

-   These axillary (lateral) buds have the potential to form new
    branching shoots, complete with leaves and flowers

Apical Growth in Shoots and Roots

[apical growth]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plant hormones control growth in the shoot apex

Â  Â Â 
The growth of the stem and the formation of new nodes is controlled by
plant hormones released from the shoot apex

-   One of the main groups of plant hormones involved in shoot and root
    growth areÂ auxins (e.g. indole-3-acetic acid / IAA)

When auxins are produced by the shoot apical meristem, it promotes
growth in the shoot apex via cell elongation and division

-   The production of auxins additionally prevents growth in lateral
    (axillary) buds, a condition known as apical dominance
-   Apical dominance ensures that a plant will use its energy to grow up
    towards the light in order to outcompete other plants
-   As the distance between the terminal bud and axillary bud increases,
    the inhibition of the axillary bud by auxin diminishes
-   Different species of plants will show different levels of apical
    dominance

The Role of Auxin in Apical Dominance

Auxin

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Auxin efflux pumps can set up concentration gradients of auxin in
plant tissue

Â  Â Â 
Auxins are a group of hormones produced by the tip of a shoot or root
(i.e. apical meristems) that regulate plant growth

-   Auxin efflux pumps can set up concentration gradients within tissues
    â€“Â changing the distribution of auxin within the plant
-   These pumps can control the direction of plant growth by determining
    which regions of plant tissue have high auxin levels
-   Auxin efflux pumps can change position within the membrane (due to
    fluidity) and be activated by various factorsÂ 

Auxin has different mechanism of action in the roots of plants versus
the shoots of plants:

-   In the shoots, auxin stimulates cell elongation and thus high
    concentrations of auxin promote growth (cells become larger)
-   In the roots, auxin inhibits cell elongation and thus high
    concentrations of auxin limit growth (cells become relatively
    smaller)

The Role of Auxin Efflux Pumps on Growth Patterns in Plant Shoots

[auxin efflux pumps]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Auxin influences cell growth rates by changing the pattern of gene
expression

Â  Â Â 
Auxin is a plant hormone and influences cell growth rates by changing
the pattern of gene expression with a plantâ€™s cells

-   Auxinâ€™s mechanism of action is different in shoots and roots as
    different gene pathways are activated in each tissue

InÂ shoots, auxin increases the flexibility of the cell wall to promote
plant growth via cell elongation

-   Auxin activates a proton pump in the plasma membrane which causes
    the secretion of H⁺ ions into the cell wall
-   The resultant decrease in pH causes cellulose fibres within the cell
    wall to loosen (by breaking the bonds between them)
-   Additionally, auxin upregulates expression ofÂ expansins, which
    similarly increases the elasticity of the cell wall
-   With the cell wall now more flexible, an influx of water (to be
    stored in the vacuole) causes the cell to increase in size

9.3 Â Growth in Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Plants adapt their growthÂ 
to environmental conditions

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Undifferentiated cells in the meristems of plants allow
    indeterminate growth
-   Mitosis and cell division in the shoot apex provide cells needed for
    extension of the stem and development of leaves
-   Plant hormones control growth in the shoot apex
-   Plant shoots respond to the environment by tropisms
-   Auxin efflux pumps can set up concentration gradients of auxin in
    plant tissue
-   Auxin influences cell growth rates by changing the pattern of gene
    expression

Applications:

-   Micropropagation of plants using tissues from the shoot apex,
    nutrient agar gels and growth hormones
-   Use of micropropagation for rapid bulking up of new varieties,
    production of virus-free strains of existing varieties and
    propagation of orchids and other rare species
Lateral Growth

Plant growth is initiated at regions called meristems â€“
undifferentiated cells capable of indeterminate divisions

-   Meristems are equivalent to embyronic stem cells in animals, but are
    retained throughout the adult life of the plant
-   This allows plants to regrow structures and even reproduce asexually
    (vegetative propagation)

All the differentiated tissues in a plant are derived from meristems â€“
either apical or lateral meristems

-   Apical meristems give rise to the primary tissues needed to increase
    a plantâ€™s length and grow new leaves and fruits
-   Lateral meristems give rise to the secondary tissues needed to
    support an increase in the plantâ€™s width (e.g. bark)

Meristem Tissue Differentiation

[meristem tissues]

Secondary (Lateral) Growth

The thickening of a plantâ€™s stem (secondary growth) is controlled by
the cambium (where lateral meristems are found)

-   Vascular cambium cells give rise to secondary xylem and phloem,
    whichÂ facilitate water and nutrient transport in the plant
-   Relative to the cambium, secondary xylem cells are formed internally
    and secondary phloem cells are formed externally
-   Cork cambium cells produce a progressively thickening layer of cork,
    which contributes to the bark of a plant
-   These cells add girth to the plant stem, resulting in the thickening
    of the trunk (lateral growth)

Representation of Secondary Growth

[secondary growth]

Growth Rings

The rate of secondary growth in a plant will change throughout the year
according to the seasons

-   Growth rates will slow in winter when there is less light available
    for photosynthesis

This results in discrete growth rings occurring within the plant stem,
which are visible when the trunk is cut in cross-section

-   Each ring typically marks the passage of one year in the life of the
    tree
-   Growth rings can be counted to estimate the age of the plant
    (dendrochronology)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Undifferentiated cells in the meristems of plants allow
indeterminate growth

Â  Â Â 
Meristems are tissues in a plant consisting of undifferentiated cells
capable of indeterminate growth

-   They are analagous to totipotent stem cells in animals, except that
    they have specific regions of growth and development
-   Meristematic tissue can allow plants to regrow structures or even
    form entirely new plants (vegetative propagation)

Meristematic tissue can be divided into apical meristems and lateral
meristems:

-   Apical meristems occur at shoot and root tips and are responsible
    for primary growth (i.e. plant lengthening)
-   Lateral meristems occur at the cambium and are responsible for
    secondary growth (i.e. plant widening / thickening)
-   Apical meristems give rise to new leaves and flowers, while lateral
    meristems are responsible for the production of bark

Micropropagation

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Micropropagation of plants using tissues from the shoot apex,
nutrient agar gels and growth hormones

Â  Â Â 
Micropropagation is a technique used to produce large numbers of
identical plants (clones) from a selected stock plant

-   Plants can reproduce asexually from meristems because they are
    undifferentiated cells capable of indeterminate growth
-   When a plant cutting is used to reproduce asexually in the native
    environment it is called vegetative propagation
-   When plant tissues are cultured in the laboratory (in vitro) in
    order to reproduce asexually it is called micropropagation

The process of micropropagation involves a number of key steps:

-   Specific plant tissue (typically the undifferentiated shoot apex) is
    selected from a stock plant and sterilised
-   The tissue sample (called the explant) is grown on a sterile
    nutrient agar gel
-   The explant is treated with growth hormones (e.g. auxins) to
    stimulate shoot and root development
-   The growing shoots can be continuously divided and separated to form
    new samples (multiplication phase)
-   Once the root and shoot are developed, the cloned plant can be
    transferred to soil

Micropropagation

[micropropagation]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of micropropagation for rapid bulking up of new varieties,
production of virus-free strains of existing

Â  Â Â varieties and propagation of orchids and other rare species

Â  Â Â 
Micropropagation is used to rapidly produce large numbers of cloned
plants under controlled conditions:
Rapid Bulking

-   Desirable stock plants can be cloned via micropropagation to
    conserve the fidelity of the selected characteristic
-   This process is more reliable that selective breeding because new
    plants are genetically identical to the stock plant
-   This technique is also used to rapidly produce large quantities of
    plants created via genetic modification

Virus-Free Strains

-   Plant viruses have the potential to decimate crops, crippling
    economies and leading to famine
-   Viruses typically spread through infected plants via the vascular
    tissue â€“ which meristems do not contain
-   Propagating plants from the non-infected meristems allows for the
    rapid reproduction of virus-free plant strains

Propagation of Rare Species

-   Micropropagation is commonly used to increase numbers ofÂ rare or
    endangered plant species
-   It is also used to increase numbers of species that are difficult to
    breed sexually (e.g. orchids)
-   It may also be used to increase numbers of plant species that are
    commercially in demandÂ 
Plant Hormones

Plant growth and development are controlled by plant hormones
(phytohormones)

-   There are 5 main plant hormones that coordinate plant growth and
    development

Auxins:

-   Promote primary growth (lengthening) by promoting cell elongation
    and increasing the rate of cell division
-   Promote apical dominance â€“ whereby the apex / tip of a plant grows
    while the lateral buds remain undeveloped
-   Auxin concentrations may change in response to directional stimuli
    (i.e. play a key role in tropisms)

Cytokinins:

-   Promote cell division (cytokinesis) and ensure roots and shoots grow
    at equal rates
-   Promotes secondary growth (thickening) and help to control the rate
    of branching by a plant
-   Cytokinins are also involved in stimulating the growth of fruit

Gibberellins:

-   Triggers germination in dormant seeds (initiates plant growth)
-   Gibberellin also causes stem elongation by promoting cell elongation
    and cell division

Ethylene:

-   A gas which acts as a plant hormone and stimulates maturation and
    ageing (senescence)
-   It is responsible for the ripening of certain fruit (auxins and
    gibberellins promote fruit growth but inhibit ripening)
-   It also contributes to the loss of leaves (abscission) and the death
    of flowers

Abscisic Acid:

-   Abscisic acid (ABA) principally functions to inhibit plant growth
    and development
-   It promotes the death of leaves (abscission) and is responsible for
    seed dormancy
-   It generally initiates stress responses in plants (like winter
    dormancy in deciduous plants)
-   Abscisic acid controls the closing of stomata and hence regulates
    water loss in plants

Tropisms

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plant shoots respond to the environment by tropisms

Â  Â Â 
Tropisms describe the growth or turning movement of an plant in response
to a directional external stimulusÂ 

-   Phototropism is a growth movement in response to a unidirectional
    light source
-   Geotropism (or gravitropism) is a growth movement in response to
    gravitational forces
-   Other tropisms include hydrotropism (responding to a water gradient)
    and thigmotropism (responding to a tactile stimulus)

Both phototropism and geotropism are controlled by the distribution of
auxin within the plant cells:

-   In geotropism, auxin will accumulate on the lower side of the plant
    in response to the force of gravity
-   In phototropism, light receptors (phototropins) trigger the
    redistribution of auxin to the dark side of the plant

In shoots, high auxin concentrations promoteÂ cell elongation, meaning
that:

-   The dark side of the shoot elongates and shoots grow towards the
    light (positive phototropism)
-   The lower side of the shoot elongates and roots growÂ away from the
    ground

In roots, high auxin concentrations inhibit cell elongation, meaning
that:

-   The dark side of the root becomes shorter and the roots grow away
    from the light (negative phototropism)
-   The lower side of the root becomes shorter and the roots turn
    downwards into the earth

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Flowering involves a change in gene expression in the shoot apex

Â  Â Â 
Flowers are the reproductive organs of angiospermophytes (flowering
plants) and develop from the shoot apex

-   Changes in gene expression trigger the enlargement of the shoot
    apical meristem
-   This tissue then differentiates to form the different flower
    structures â€“ sepals, petals, stamen and pistil

The activation of genes responsible for flowering is influenced by
abiotic factors â€“ typically linked to the seasons

-   Flowering plants will typically come into bloom when a suitable
    pollinator is most abundantÂ 
-   The most common trigger for a change in gene expression is day/night
    length (photoperiodism)

â€¢ Â Drawing of half-views of animal-pollinated flowers

Â  Â Â 
Flowers are the reproductive organs of angiospermophytes (flowering

-   Most flowers possess both male and female structures (monoecious),
    but some may only possess one structure (dioecious)

Structure of a Flower

[My Image 1] [My Image 2]

(Click on image to hide / show labels)

Flower Structures

The male part of the flower is called the stamen and is composed of:

-   Anther â€“ pollen producing organ of the flower (pollen is the male
    gamete of a flowering plant)
-   Filament â€“ slender stalk supporting the anther (makes the anther
    accessible to pollinators)

The female part of the flower is called the pistil (or carpel) and is
composed of:

-   Stigma â€“ the sticky, receptive tip of the pistil that is
    responsible for catching the pollen
-   Style â€“ the tube-shaped connection between the stigma and ovule
    (it elevates the stigma to help catch pollen)
-   Ovule â€“ the structure that contains the female reproductive cells
    (after fertilisation, it will develop into a seed)

In addition to these reproductive structures, flowers possess a number
of other support structures:

-   Petals â€“ brightly coloured modified leaves, which function to
    attract pollinators
-   Sepal â€“ Outer covering which protects the flower when in bud
-   Peduncle â€“ Stalk of the flower

Germination

List

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Design of experiments to test hypotheses about factors affecting
germination

Â  Â Â 
Germination is the process by which a seed emerges from a period of
dormancy and begins to sprout

For germination to occur, a seed requires a combination of:

-   Oxygen â€“ for aerobic respiration (the seed requires large amounts
    of ATP in order to develop)
-   Water â€“ to metabolically activate the seed (triggers the synthesis
    of gibberellin)
-   Temperature â€“ seeds require certain temperature conditions in
    order to sprout (for optimal function of enzymes)
-   pH â€“ seeds require a suitable soil pH in order to sprout (for
    optimal function of enzymes)

Additionally, certain plant species may require additional conditions
for germination:

-   Fire â€“ some seeds will only sprout after exposure to intense heat
    (e.g. after bushfires remove established flora)
-   Freezing â€“ some seeds will only sprout after periods of intense
    cold (e.g. in spring, following the winter snows)
-   Digestion â€“ some seeds require prior animal digestion to erode the
    seed coat before the seed will sprout
-   Washing â€“ some seeds may be covered with inhibitors and will only
    sprout after being washed to remove the inhibitors
-   Scarification â€“ seeds are more likely to germinate if the seed
    coat is weakened from physical damage

Experiments can be developed using any of these factors as an
independent variable

-   Germination can be measured by the rate of seed growth over a set
    period of time

Factors Affecting Germination

[germination factors]
Germination Stages

The first step in the germination process is the metabolic activation of
a dormant seed

-   Germination begins with the absorption of water, which causes
    gibberellin to be produced
-   Gibberellin triggers the synthesis of amylase, which breaks down
    starch into maltose
-   Maltose is either hydrolysed (to glucose) for energy, or polymerised
    (to cellulose) for cell wall formation
-   This energy and cellular building blocks is used to promote cell
    division and the growth of a nascent shoot

Once the seed is metabolically activated, germination proceeds according
to the following stages:

-   The seed coat (testa) ruptures and the embryonic root (radicle)
    grows into the ground to extract key nutrients and minerals
-   The cotyledon emerges and produces the growing shootâ€™s first
    leaves
-   The growing plant can be divided into the epicotyl (embryonic
    shoot), hypocotyl (embryonic stem) and developing roots

9.4 Â Reproduction in Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Reproduction in flowering plants is influenced
by the biotic and abiotic environment

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Flowering involves a change in gene expression in the shoot apex
-   The switch to flowering is a response to the length of light and
    dark periods in many plants
-   Success in plant reproduction depends on pollination, fertilization
    and seed dispersal
-   Most flowering plants use mutualistic relationships with pollinators
    in sexual reproduction

Applications:

-   Methods used to induce short-day plants to flower out of season

Skill:

-   Drawing internal structure of seeds
-   Drawing of half-views of animal-pollinated flowers
-   Design of experiments to test hypotheses about factors affecting
    germination
Monocots versus Dicots

Flowering plants are the most diverse group of land plants and belong
within a phyla called angiospermophyta

-   Historically, angiosperms were subdivided into two identifiable
    groups â€“ monocotyledons and dicotyledons
-   However, recent molecular evidence has caused the dicotyledons to be
    reclassified as a paraphyletic groupÂ 
-   Due to the ease of identification, many scientists still prefer to
    categorise angiosperms as monocots or dicots

Monocotyledons and dicotyledons can be differentiated according to a
number of features:

-   Cotyledons â€“ monocots have one cotyledon within their seed, dicots
    have two cotyledons
-   Leaf veins â€“ monocots show parallel venation, whereas dicots
    display reticulated venation
-   Roots â€“ monocots have fibrous (adventitious) roots, dicots have a
    main tap root with lateral branches
-   Floral organs â€“ monocots have flower parts in multiples of three,
    dicots in multiples of four or five
-   Stem vascularisation â€“ the vascular bundles in monocots are
    scattered, whereas they form a ringed structure in dicots
-   Pollen â€“ monocot pollen has a single pore (monosulcate), dicot
    pollen has three pores or furrows (trisulcate)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The switch to flowering is a response to the length of light and
dark periods in many plants

Â  Â Â 
The purpose of flowering is to enable the plant to sexually reproduce
via pollination, fertilisation and seed dispersal

-   Consequently, flowers need to bloom when pollinators are most active
    and abundant â€“ this is dependent on seasons
-   Some plants bloom in long day conditions (summer), whereas other
    plants bloom in short day conditions (autumn / winter)

The critical factor responsible for flowering is the length of light and
dark periods, which is detected by phytochromes

Phytochromes

Phytochromes are leaf pigments which are used by the plant to detect
periods of light and darkness

-   The response of the plant to the relative lengths of light and
    darkness is called photoperiodismÂ 

Phytochromes exist in two forms â€“ an active form and an inactive form:

-   The inactive form of phytochrome (P_(r)) is converted into the
    active form when it absorbs red light (~660 nm)
-   The active form of phytochrome (P_(fr)) is broken down into the
    inactive form when itÂ absorbs far red light (~725 nm)
-   Additionally, the active form will gradually revert to the inactive
    form in the absence of light (darkness reversion)

Because sunlight contains more red light than moonlight, the active form
is predominant during the day

-   Similarly, as the active form is reverted in darkness, the inactive
    form is predominant during the night

[phytochrome]

Photoperiodism

Only the active form of phytochrome (P_(fr)) is capable of causing
flowering, however its action differs in certain types of plants

-   Plants can be classed as short-day or long-day plants, however the
    critical factor in determiningÂ their activity is night length

Short-day plants flower when the days are short â€“ hence require the
night period to exceed a critical length

-   In short-day plants,Â P_(fr)Â inhibits flowering and hence flowering
    requires low levels ofÂ P_(fr)Â (i.e. resulting from long nights)

Long-day plants flower when the days are long â€“ hence require the
night period to be less than a critical length

-   In long-day plants,Â P_(fr)Â activatesÂ flowering and hence
    flowering requires high levels ofÂ P_(fr)Â (i.e. resulting from
    short nights)

[sid the lad]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Methods used to induce short-day plants to flower out of season

Â  Â Â 
Horticulturalists can manipulate the flowering of short-day and long-day
plants by controlling the exposure of light

-   The critical night length required for a flowering response must be
    uninterrupted in order to be effective

Long-day plants require periods of darkness to be less than an
uninterrupted critical length

-   These plants will traditionally not flower during the winter and
    autumn months when night lengths are long
-   Horticulturalists can trigger flowering in these plants by exposing
    the plant to a light source during the night
-   Carnations are an example of a long-day plant

Short-day plants require periods of darkness to be greater than
anÂ uninterrupted critical length

-   These plants will traditionally not flower during the summer months
    when night lengths are short
-   Horticulturalists can trigger flowering in these plants by covering
    the plant with an opaque black cloth for ~12 hours a day
-   Crysanthemums are an example of a short-day plant

Plant Reproduction

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Success in plant reproduction depends on pollination,
fertilization and seed dispersal

Â  Â Â 
Plants can reproduce in a number of different ways:

-   Vegetative propagation (asexual reproduction from a plant cutting)
-   Spore formations (e.g. moulds, ferns)
-   Pollen transfer (flowering plants â€“ angiospermophytes)

Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the transfer of pollen
(male gamete) to an ova (female gamete)

-   This involves three distinct phases â€“ pollination, fertilization
    and seed dispersal

Pollination:

-   The transfer of pollen grains from an anther (male plant structure)
    to a stigma (female plant structure)
-   Many plants possess both male and female structures (monoecious) and
    can potentially self-pollinate
-   From an evolutionary perspective, cross-pollination is preferable as
    it improves genetic diversity

Fertilisation:

-   Fusion of a male gamete nuclei with a female gamete nuclei to form a
    zygote
-   In plants, the male gamete is stored in the pollen grain and the
    female gamete is found in the ovule

Seed dispersal:

-   Fertilisation of gametes results in the formation of a seed, which
    moves away from the parental plant
-   This seed dispersal reduces competition for resources between the
    germinating seed and the parental plant
-   There are a variety of seed dispersal mechanisms, including wind,
    water, fruits and animals
    -   Seed structure will vary depending on the mechanism of dispersal
        employed by the plant

Plant Reproduction Stages

[plant reproduction]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Most flowering plants use mutualistic relationships with
pollinators in sexual reproduction

Â  Â Â 
Cross-pollination involves transferring pollen grains from one plant to
the ovule of a different plant

-   Pollen can be transferred by wind or water, but is commonly
    transferred by animals (called pollinators)

Pollinators are involved in a mutualistic relationship with the
flowering plant â€“ whereby both species benefit from the interaction

-   The flowering plant gains a means of sexual reproduction (via
    theÂ transference of pollen between plants)
-   The animal gains a source of nutrition (plants secrete a sugar-rich
    substance called nectar to attract pollinators

Common examples of pollinators include birds, bats and insects
(including bees and butterflies)

-   Flowers may be structured to optimise access for certain pollinators
    (e.g. tube-shaped flowers for birds with long beaks)

Skill:

Â  Â Â 
When fertilisation occurs, the ovule will develop into a seed (which may
be contained within a fruit)

-   The seed will be dispersed from the parental plant and will then
    germinate, giving rise to a new plant

A typical seed will possess the following features:

-   Testa â€“ an outer seed coat that protects the embryonic plant
-   Micropyle â€“ a small pore in the outer covering of the seed, that
    allows for the passage of water
-   Cotyledon â€“ contains the food stores for the seed and forms the
    embryonic leaves
-   Plumule â€“ the embryonic shoot (also called the epicotyl)
-   Radicle â€“ the embryonic root

Evaporation

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The adhesive property of water and evaporation generate tension
forces in leaf cell walls

Â  Â Â 
Water is lost from the leaves of the plant when it is converted into
vapour (evaporation) and diffuses from the stomata

-   Some of the light energy absorbed by leaves is converted into heat,
    which evaporates water within the spongy mesophyll
-   This vapour diffuses out of the leaf via stomata, creating a
    negative pressure gradient within the leaf
-   This negative pressure creates a tension force in leaf cell walls
    which draws water from the xylem (transpiration pull)
-   The water is pulled from the xylem under tension due to the adhesive
    attraction between water and theÂ leaf cell walls

Evaporation within Leaf Tissue

[evaporation]

Regulating Water Loss

The amount of water lost from the leaves (transpiration rate) is
regulated by the opening and closing of stomata

-   Guard cells flank the stomata and can occlude the opening by
    becoming increasingly flaccid in response to cellular signals
-   When a plant begins to wilt from water stress, dehydrated mesophyll
    cells release the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA)
-   Abscisic acid triggers the efflux of potassium from guard cells,
    decreasing water pressure within the cells (lose turgor)
-   A loss of turgor makes the stomatal pore close, as the guard cells
    become flaccid and block the opening

Transpiration rates will be higher when stomatal pores are open than
when they are closed

-   Stomatal pores are responsible for gas exchange in the leaf and
    hence levels of photosynthesis will affect transpiration
-   Other factors that will affect transpiration rates include humidity,
    temperature, light intensity and wind

9.1 Â Transport in the Xylem of Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Structure and function are Â 
correlated in the xylem of plants

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Transpiration is the inevitable consequence of gas exchange in the
    leaf
-   Plants transport water from the roots to the leaves to replace
    losses from transpiration
-   The cohesive property of water and the structure of the xylem
    vessels allow transport under tension
-   The adhesive property of water and evaporation generate tension
    forces in leaf cell walls
-   Active uptake of mineral ions in the roots causes absorption of
    water by osmosis

Applications:

-   Adaptations of plants in deserts and in saline soils for water
    conservation
-   Models of water transport in xylem using simple apparatus including
    blotting or filter paper, porous pots and capillary tubing

Key Features:

-   Palisade mesophyll is the site of photosynthesis and hence is
    located on the upper surface of the leaf (facing sunlight)
-   Spongy mesophyll is the main site of gas exchange and is hence
    located on the lower surface of the leaf (near stomata)
-   Stomata are on the underside of the leaf (prevents obstruction so as
    to maintain an open channel for gas exchange)
-   The top surface of the leaf is covered by a thick, waxy cuticle
    (prevents water absorption which would affect transpiration)
-   Vascular bundles (including xylem and phloem) are located centrally
    to allow for optimal access by all leaf cells

Application:

â€¢ Â Models of water transport in xylem using apparatus including
filter paper, porous pots or capillary tubing

Â  Â Â 
The movement of water up the length of the xylem can be modelled using a
number of simple apparatus

-   These include capillary tubing, filter or blotting paper and porous
    pots

Capillary Tubing:

-   Water has the capacity to flow along narrow spaces in opposition to
    external forces like gravity (capillary action)
-   This is due to a combination of surface tension (cohesive forces)
    and adhesion with the walls of the tube surface
-   The thinner the tube or the less dense the fluid, the higher the
    liquid will rise (xylem vessels are thin: 20 â€“ 200 Âµm)Â 

Filter Paper:

-   Filter paper (or blotting paper) will absorb water due to both
    adhesive and cohesive properties
-   When placed perpendicular to a water source, the water will hence
    rise up along the length of the paper
-   This is comparable to the movement of water up a xylem (the paper
    and the xylem wall are both composed of cellulose)

Porous Pots:

-   Porous pots are semi-permeable containers that allow for the free
    passage of certain small materials through pores
-   The loss of water from the pot is similar to the evaporative water
    loss that occurs in the leaves of plants
-   If the porous pot is attached by an airtight seal to a tube, the
    water loss creates a negative pressure that draws more liquid

-   When a plant is affixed to theÂ potometer, transpiration can be
    indirectly identified by the movement of water towards the plant
-   This water movement can be assessed as a change in meniscus level or
    by the movement of an air bubble towards the plant
-   The initial starting position of the meniscus or air bubble can be
    adjusted by introducing additional water from a reservoirÂ 

When measuring transpiration rates with aÂ potometer, it is important to
remember that not all water is lost to transpiration

-   A small amount of water (~2%) is used in photosynthesis and to
    maintain the viable turgidity of plant cells

Measuring Transpiration Rate with a Potometer

[potometer]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Design of an experiment to test hypotheses about the effect of
temperature or humidity on transpiration rates

Â  Â Â 
Potometers can be used to test a number of variables that may affect the
rate of transpiration in plants

-   These variables include temperature, humidity, light intensity and
    wind exposure

Temperature:

-   Increasing the ambient temperature is predicted to cause an increase
    in the rate of transpiration
-   Higher temperatures lead to an increase in the rate of water
    vaporisation within the mesophyll, leading to more evaporation
-   The effect of temperature variation can be tested experimentally by
    using heaters or submerging in heated water baths

Humidity:

-   Increasing the humidity is predicted to cause a decrease in the rate
    of transpiration
-   Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the air â€“ less vapour
    will diffuse from the leaf if there is more vapour in the air
-   The effect of humidity can be tested experimentally by encasing the
    plant in a plastic bag with variable levels of vapour

Light Intensity:

-   Increasing the light intensity to which a plant is exposed is
    predicted to cause an increase in the rate of transpiration
-   Increasing light exposure will cause more stomata to open in order
    to facilitate photosynthetic gas exchange
-   The effect of light intensity can be tested experimentally by
    placing the plant at variable distances from a lamp

Wind Exposure:

-   Increasing the level of wind exposure is predicted to cause an
    increase in the rate of transpiration
-   Wind / air circulation will function to remove water vapour from
    near the leaf, effectively reducing proximal humidity
-   The effect of wind can be tested experimentally by using fans to
    circulate the air around a plant
Root Tissue

Key Features:

-   The outer layer (epidermis) may have protrusions called root hairs
    to increase available surface area for material exchange
-   The central region is called the stele and is surrounded by an
    endodermis with a Casparian strip (controls water transport)
-   The pericycle / cambium provides strength to the root and is also
    responsible for the development of lateral roots
-   The vascular bundle is located centrally to withstand stretching
    forces and allow for material transport to be controlled
Root Uptake

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Active uptake of mineral ions in the roots causes absorption of
water by osmosis

Â  Â Â 
Plants take up water and mineral ions from the soil via their roots and
thus need a maximal surface area to optimise this uptake

-   Some plants have a fibrous, highly branching root system which
    increases the surface area available for absorption
-   Other plants have a main tap root with lateral branches, which can
    penetrate the soil to access deeper reservoirs of water

The epidermis of roots may have cellular extensions called root hairs,
which further increases the surface area for absorption

-   Materials absorbed by the root epidermis diffuse across the cortex
    towards a central stele, where the xylem is located
-   The stele is surrounded by an endodermis layer that is impermeable
    to the passive flow of water and ions (Casparian strip)
-   Water and minerals are pumped across this barrier by specialised
    cells, allowing the rate of uptake to be controlled

Structure of a Root Â (Vascular Plant)

[root structure]

Mineral Uptake

Fertile soil typically contains negatively charged clay particles to
which positively charged mineral ions (cations) may attach

-   Minerals that need to be taken up from the soil include Mg²⁺ (for
    chlorophyll), nitrates (for amino acids), Na⁺, K⁺ and PO₄^(3â€“)

Mineral ions may passively diffuse into the roots, but will more
commonly be actively uploaded by indirect active transport

-   Root cells contain proton pumps that actively expel H⁺ ions (stored
    in the vacuole of root cells) into the surrounding soil
-   The H⁺ ions displace the positively charged mineral ions from the
    clay, allowing them to diffuse into the root along a gradient
-   Negatively charged mineral ions (anions) may bind to the H⁺ ions and
    be reabsorbed along with the proton

Uptake of Mineral Ions via Indirect Active Transport

[mineral uptake]

Water Uptake

Water will follow the mineral ions into the root via osmosis â€“ moving
towards the region with a higher solute concentration

-   The rate of water uptake will be regulated by specialised water
    channels (aquaporins) on the root cell membrane

Once inside the root, water will move towards the xylem either via the
cytoplasm (symplastic) or via the cell wall (apoplastic)

-   In the symplastic pathway, water moves continuously through the
    cytoplasm of cells (connected via plasmodesmata)
-   In the apoplastic pathway, water cannot cross the Casparian strip
    and is transferred to the cytoplasm of the endodermis

Apoplastic vs Symplastic Pathway

[symplastic vs apoplastic]
Stem Tissue

Below is a microscopic cross-section of a typical stem (taken from a
dicotyledonous plant)

-   Distribution of tissues may differ between plant types (e.g.
    vascular bundles are scattered in monocotyledons)

[My Image 1] [My Image 2]

Click on the above image to show / hide labels

Key Features:

-   The epidermis covers the outer surface and functions to waterproof,
    protect the stem and control gas exchange
-   The ground tissue (cortex and pith) is found internally and assist
    in the transport and storage of materials within the stem
-   The cambium is a centrally located, circular layer of
    undifferentiated cells responsible for lateral growth of the stem
-   Vascular bundles are arranged in bundles near the outer edge of the
    stem to resist compression and bending
    -   The xylem is located to the interior side of the bundle and the
        phloem is on the exterior side (phloem = outside)
Transpiration

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Transpiration is the inevitable consequence of gas exchange in the
leaf

â€¢ Â Plants transport water from the roots to the leaves to replace
losses from transpiration

Â  Â Â 
Transpiration is the loss of water vapour from the stems and leaves of
plants

-   Light energy converts water in the leaves to vapour, which
    evaporates from the leaf via stomataÂ 
-   New water is absorbed from the soil by the roots, creating a
    difference in pressure between the leaves (low) and roots (high)
-   Water will flow, via the xylem, along the pressure gradient to
    replace the water lost from leaves (transpiration stream)

Stomata are pores on the underside of the leaf which facilitate gas
exchange (needed for photosynthesis)

-   As photosynthetic gas exchange requires stomata to be open,
    transpiration will be affected by the level of photosynthesis
-   Hence, transpiration is an inevitable consequence of gas exchange in
    the leaf

Transpiration Stream

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The cohesive property of water and the structure of the xylem
vessels allow transport under tension

Â  Â Â 
The flow of water through the xylem from the roots to the leaf, against
gravity, is called the transpiration stream

-   Water rises through xylem vessels due to two key properties of water
    â€“ cohesion and adhesion

Cohesion:

-   Cohesion is the force of attraction between two particles of the
    same substance (e.g. between two water molecules)
-   Water molecules are polar and can form a type of intermolecular
    association called a hydrogen bond
-   This cohesive property causes water molecules to be dragged up the
    xylem towards the leaves in a continuous stream

Adhesion:

-   Adhesion is the force of attraction between two particles of
    different substances (e.g. water molecule and xylem wall)
-   The xylem wall is also polar and hence can form intermolecular
    associations with water molecules
-   As water molecules move up the xylem via capillary action, they pull
    inward on the xylem walls to generate further tension

Water Transport via the Xylem

This browser cannot play the embedded video file.

Structure of the Xylem

The xylem is a specialised structure that functions to facilitate the
movement of water throughout the plant

-   It is a tube composed of dead cells that are hollow (no protoplasm)
    to allow for the free movement of water
-   Because the cells are dead, the movement of water is an entirely
    passive process and occurs in one direction only
-   The cell wall contains numerous pores (called pits), which enables
    water to be transferred between cells
-   Walls have thickened cellulose and are reinforced by lignin, so as
    to provide strength as water is transported under tension

Basic Xylem Structure

[xylem]

Xylems can be composed of tracheids (all vascular plants) and vessel
elements (certain vascular plants only)

-   Tracheids are tapered cells that exchange water solely via pits,
    leading to a slower rate of water transfer
-   In vessel elements, the end walls have become fused to form a
    continuous tube, resulting in a faster rate of water transfer

All xylem vessels are reinforced by lignin, which may be deposited in
different ways:

-   In annular vessels, the lignin forms a pattern of circular rings at
    equal distances from each other
-   In spiral vessels, the lignin is present in the form of a helix or
    coilÂ

Water Conservation

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Adaptations of plants in deserts and in saline soils for water
conservation

Â  Â Â 
Desert plants (xerophytes) and plants that grow in high salinity
(halophytes) possess various adaptations for water conservation

-   Xerophytes will have high rates of transpiration due to the high
    temperatures and low humidity of desert environments
-   Halophytes will lose water as the high intake of salt from the
    surrounding soils will draw water from plant tissue via osmosis

Xerophytes

Xerophytes are plants that canÂ tolerate dry conditions (such as
deserts) due to the presence of a number of adaptations:

-   Reduced leaves â€“ reducing the total number and size of leaves will
    reduce the surface area available for water loss
-   Rolled leaves â€“ rolling up leaves reduces the exposure of stomata
    to the air and hence reduces evaporative water loss
-   Thick, waxy cuticle â€“ having leaves covered by a thickened cuticle
    prevents water loss from the leaf surfaceÂ 
-   Stomata in pits â€“ having stomata in pits, surrounded by hairs,
    traps water vapour and hence reduces transpiration
-   Low growth â€“ low growing plants are less exposed to wind and more
    likely to be shaded, reducing water loss
-   CAM physiology â€“ plants with CAM physiology open their stomata at
    night, reducing water loss via evaporation

Halophytes

Halophytes are plants that can tolerate salty conditions (such as
marshlands) due to the presence of a number of adaptations:

-   Cellular sequestration â€“ halophytes can sequester toxic ions and
    salts within the cell wall or vacuoles
-   Tissue partitioning â€“ plants may concentrate salts in particular
    leaves, which then drop off (abscission)
-   Root level exclusion â€“ plant roots may be structured to exclude
    ~95% of the salt in soil solutions
-   Salt excretion â€“ certain parts of the plant (e.g. stem) may
    contain salt glands which actively eliminate salt
-   Altered flowering schedule â€“ halophytes may flower at specific
    timesÂ (e.g. rainy seasons) to minimise salt exposureÂ

â€¢ Â Drawing the structure of primary xylem vessels in sections of
stems based on microscope images

Â  Â Â 
When drawing the structure of primary xylem vessels, it is important to
remember the following features:

-   Vessel elements should be drawn as a continuous tube (tracheids will
    consist of interlinking tapered cells)
-   The remnants of the fused end wall can be represented as indents
    (these forms perforated end plates)
-   The xylem wall should contain gaps (pits), which enable the exchange
    of water molecules
-   Lignin can be represented by either a spiral (coiled) or annular
    (rings) arrangement

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plants transport organic compounds from sources to sinks

Â  Â Â 
Translocation is the movement of organic compounds (e.g. sugars, amino
acids) from sources to sinks

-   The source is where the organic compounds are synthesised â€“ this
    is the photosynthetic tissues (leaves)
-   The sink is where the compounds are delivered to for use or storage
    â€“ this includes roots, fruits and seeds

Organic compounds are transported from sources to sinks via a vascular
tube system called the phloem

-   Sugars are principally transported as sucrose (disaccharide),
    because it is soluble but metabolically inert
-   The nutrient-rich, viscous fluid of the phloem is called plant sap

Active Translocation

Fungal Hyphae

Hyphae are the tubular projections of multicellular fungi that form a
filamentous network (mycelium)

-   Fungal hyphae release digestive enzymes in order toÂ absorb
    nutrients from food sources

Certain species of fungi may form a symbiotic relationship with plants
whereby both species benefit (mutualism)

-   The hyphae penetrate into the plantâ€™s root tissue in response to
    chemical exudates produced by both plant and fungus
-   Within the cortical cells of the root, the hyphae form arbuscular
    projections which absorb nutrients from the plant cells
-   In return, the fungus transfers minerals absorbed from the soil into
    the plant, so both species benefit from the interaction

9.2 Â Transport in the Phloem of Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Structure and function are Â 
correlated in the phloem of plants

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Plants transport organic compounds from sources to sinks
-   Active transport is used to load organic compounds into phloem sieve
    tubes at the source
-   High concentrations of solutes in the phloem at the source lead to
    water uptake by osmosis
-   Incompressibility of water allows transport along hydrostatic
    pressure gradients
-   Raised hydrostatic pressure causes the contents of the phloem to
    flow towards sinks

Applications:

-   Structure-function relationships of phloem sieve tubes

Skills:

-   Identification of xylem and phloem in microscope images of stem and
    root
-   Analysis of data from experiments measuring phloem transport rates

Understanding:

â€¢ Â High concentrations of solutes in the phloem at the source lead to
water uptake by osmosis

â€¢ Â Incompressibility of water allows transport along hydrostatic
pressure gradients

Â  Â Â 
At the Source

-   The active transport of solutes (such as sucrose) into the phloem by
    companion cells makes the sap solution hypertonic
-   This causes water to be drawn from the xylem via osmosis (water
    moves towards higher solute concentrations)
-   Due to the incompressibility of water, this build up of water in the
    phloem causes the hydrostatic pressure to increase
-   This increase in hydrostatic pressure forces the phloem sap to move
    towards areas of lower pressure (mass flow)
-   Hence, the phloem transports solutes away from the source (and
    consequently towards the sink)

Active Translocation via Mass Flow

[active translocation]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Raised hydrostatic pressure causes the contents of the phloem to
flow towards sinks

Â  Â Â 
At the Sink

-   The solutes within the phloem are unloaded by companion cells and
    transported into sinks (roots, fruits, seeds, etc.)
-   This causes the sap solution at the sink to become increasingly
    hypotonic (lower solute concentration)
-   Consequently, water is drawn out of the phloem and back into the
    xylem by osmosis
-   This ensures that the hydrostatic pressure at the sink is always
    lower than the hydrostatic pressure at the source
-   Hence, phloem sap will always move from the source towards the sink
-   When organic molecules are transported into the sink, they are
    either metabolised or stored within the tonoplast of vacuoles

Mechanisms of Phloem Unloading

Phloem Loading

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Active transport is used to load organic compounds into phloem
sieve tubes at the source

Â  Â Â 
Organic compounds produced at the source are actively loaded into phloem
sieve tubes by companion cells

-   Materials can pass into the sieve tube via interconnecting
    plasmodesmata (symplastic loading)
-   Alternatively, materials can be pumped across the intervening cell
    wall by membrane proteins (apoplastic loading)

Apoplastic loading of sucrose into the phloem sieve tubes is an active
transport process that requires ATP expenditure

-   Hydrogen ions (H⁺) are actively transported out of phloem cells by
    proton pumps (involves the hydrolysis of ATP)
-   The concentration of hydrogen ions consequently builds up outside of
    the cell, creating a proton gradient
-   Hydrogen ions passively diffuse back into the phloem cell via a
    co-transport protein, which requires sucrose movement
-   This results in a build up of sucrose within the phloem sieve tube
    for subsequent transport from the source

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Structure-function relationships of phloem sieve tubes

Â  Â Â 
Phloem sieve tubes are primarily composed of two main types of cells â€“
sieve element cells and companion cells

-   The phloem also contains schlerenchymal and parenchymal cells which
    fill additional spaces and provide support

Sieve Element Cells

Sieve elements are long and narrow cells that are connected together to
form the sieve tube

-   Sieve elements are connected by sieve plates at their transverse
    ends, which are porous to enable flow between cells
-   Sieve elements have no nuclei and reduced numbers of organelles to
    maximise space for the translocation of materials
-   The sieve elements also have thick and rigid cell walls to withstand
    the hydrostatic pressures which facilitate flow

Companion Cells

Provide metabolic support for sieve element cells and facilitate the
loading and unloading of materials at source and sink

-   Possess an infolding plasma membrane which increases SA:Vol ratio to
    allow for more material exchange
-   Have many mitochondria to fuel the active transport of materials
    between the sieve tube and the source or sink
-   Contain appropriate transport proteins within the plasma membrane to
    move materials into or out of the sieve tube

Sieve elements are unable to sustain independent metabolic activity
without the support of a companion cell

-   This is because the sieve element cells have no nuclei and fewer
    organelles (to maximise flow rate)
-   Plasmodesmata exist between sieve elements and companion cells in
    relatively large numbers
-   These connect the cytoplasm of the two cells and mediate the
    symplastic exchange of metabolites

Structure of a Phloem Sieve Tube

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of xylem and phloem in microscope images of stem
and root

Â  Â Â 
Xylem and phloem vessels are grouped into bundles that extend from the
roots to the shoots in vascular plants

-   Differences in distribution and arrangement exist between plant
    types (e.g. monocotyledons vs dicotyledons)
-   Xylem and phloem vessels can usually be differentiated by the
    diameter of their cavity (xylem have larger cavities)

Roots

-   In monocotyledons, the stele is large and vessels will form a
    radiating circle around the central pith
    -   Xylem vessels will be located more internally and phloem vessels
        will be located more externally
-   In dicotyledons, the stele is very small and the xylem is located
    centrally with the phloem surrounding it
    -   Xylem vessels may form a cross-like shape (â€˜Xâ€™ for xylem),
        while the phloem is situated in the surrounding gaps

[My Image 1] [My Image 2]

Click on the image to display false colour representations of xylem
(red) and phloem (blue)

Stem

-   In monocotyledons, the vascular bundles are found in a scattered
    arrangement throughout the stem
    -   Phloem vessels will be positioned externally (towards outside of
        stem) â€“ remember: Â phloem = outside Â 
-   In dicotyledons, the vascular bundles are arranged in a circle
    around the centre of the stem (pith)
    -   Phloem and xylem vessels will be separated by the cambium (xylem
        on inside ; phloem on outside)

Storage Organs

A storage organ is a part of a plant specifically modified to store
energy (e.g. carbohydrates) or water

-   They are usually found underground (for protection from herbivores)
    and result from changes to roots, leaves or stems

Examples of storage organs include:

-   Bulbs â€“ Modified leaf bases (found as underground vertical shoots)
    that contain layers called scales (e.g. onions)
-   Storage Roots â€“ Modified roots that store water or food in an
    enlarged central stele (e.g. carrots)
-   Tubers â€“ Horizontal underground stems that store carbohydrates
    (e.g. potatoes)

Application:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data from experiments measuring phloem transport rates
using aphid stylets and radioactively-

Â  Â Â labelled carbon dioxide

Â  Â Â 
Aphids are a group of insects, belonging to the order Hemiptera, which
feed primarily on sap extracted from phloem

-   Aphids possess a protruding mouthpiece (called a stylet), which
    pierces the plantâ€™s sieve tube to allow sap to be extracted
-   The penetration of the stylet into the sieve tube is aided by
    digestive enzymes that soften the intervening tissue layers
-   If the stylet is severed, sap will continue to flow from the plant
    due to the hydrostatic pressure within the sieve tube

Extraction of Phloem Sap via an Aphid Stylet

[aphid stylet]

Â 

Measuring Phloem Transport

Aphids can be used to collect sap at various sites along a plant's
length and thus provide a measure of phloem transport rates

-   A plant is grown within a lab with the leaves sealed within a glass
    chamber containing radioactively-labelled carbon dioxide
-   The leaves will convert the CO₂ into radioactively-labelled sugars
    (via photosynthesis), which are transported by the phloem
-   Aphids are positioned along the plantâ€™s length and encouraged to
    feed on the phloem sap
-   Once feeding has commenced, the aphid stylet is severed and sap
    continues to flow from the plant at the selected positions
-   The sap is then analysed for the presence of radioactively-labelled
    sugars
-   The rate of phloem transport (translocation rate) can be calculated
    based on the time taken for the radioisotope to be detected at
    different positions along the plantâ€™s length

Example of Phloem Transport Rate Data

[aphid experiment]

Factors Affecting Translocation Rate

The rate of phloem transport will principally be determined by the
concentration of dissolved sugars in the phloem

The concentration of dissolved sugars in the phloem sap will be affected
by:

-   The rate of photosynthesis (which is affected by light intensity,
    CO₂ concentration, temperature, etc.)
-   The rate of cellular respiration (this may be affected by any factor
    which physically stresses the plant)
-   The rate of transpiration (this will potentially determine how much
    water enters the phloem)
-   The diameter of the sieve tubes (will affect the hydrostatic
    pressure and may differ between plant species)
Xylem versus Phloem

Xylem and phloem are both transport vessels that combine to form a
vascular bundle in higher order plants

-   The vascular bundle functions to connect tissues in the roots, stem
    and leaves as well as providing structural support

Xylem

-   Moves materials via the process of transpiration
-   Transports water and minerals from the roots to aerial parts of the
    plant (unidirectional transport)
-   Xylem occupy the inner portion or centre of the vascular bundle and
    is composed of vessel elements and tracheids
-   Vessel wall consists of fused cells that create a continuous tube
    for the unimpeded flow of materials
-   Vessels are composed of dead tissue at maturity, such that vessels
    are hollow with no cell contents

Phloem

-   Moves materials via the process of active translocation
-   Transports food and nutrients to storage organs and growing parts of
    the plant (bidirectional transport)
-   Phloem occupy the outer portion of the vascular bundle and are
    composed of sieve tube elements and companion cells
-   Vessel wall consists of cells that are connected at their transverse
    ends to form porous sieve plates (function as cross walls)
-   Vessels are composed of living tissue, however sieve tube elements
    lack nuclei and have few organelles

Why the change?

While the new IB syllabus covers much the same content as the old
syllabus, the style has changed significantly:

-   The old syllabus was organised into dot points, each of which
    included a specific command term that identified the level of
    knowledge required
-   The new syllabus is organised into assessment statements that do not
    include command terms â€“ this makes the knowledge requirements
    broader and vague

To reflect this change, the new website no longer addresses content as
an itemised list, however every assessment statement is still
specifically covered

-   For each sub-topic, assessment statements are grouped and organised
    by subject matter and explained as part of theÂ core content
-   Additional information that helps with understanding but is not
    specifically referenced by an assessment statement is included
    asÂ extra content

The new layout is not as concise as the old layout, but this is because
the new syllabus is not as concise as the old syllabus

-   The new layout is a lot prettier than the old layout though â€“ hope
    you like it!

Gastrulation

Gastrulation is an early phase of embryogenesis whereby a single-layered
blastula differentiates into three germ layers

-   The organisation of cell layers occurs by different mechanisms in
    different types of animals
-   The end result in all cases is a trilaminar (three layered) mass of
    cells called a gastrula
-   Gastrulation precedes further cellular differentiation by processes
    such as neurulation

Types of Cell Movements During Gastrulation

[gastrulation]

Germ Layers

Gastrulation results in the production of three germ layers â€“ ectoderm
(outer), mesoderm (middle) and endoderm (inner)

-   The ectoderm will form the nervous system (via neurulation) and
    outer surfaces such as skin, pigment cells and hair cells
-   The mesoderm will form the majority of body organs, including
    muscle, blood vessels, kidney, heart and skeleton
-   The endoderm will form the respiratory and digestive tracts, as well
    as associated organs such as the liver and pancreas

A1 Â Neural Development

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Modification of neurons starts in the earliest stages of
embryogenesis and continues to the final years of life

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The neural tube of embryonic chordates is formed by infolding of
    ectoderm followed by elongation of the tube
-   Neurons are initially produced by differentiation in the neural tube

-   An axon grows from each immature neuron in response to chemical
    stimuli
-   Some axons extend beyond the neural tube to reach other parts of the
    body
-   A developing neuron forms multiple synapses
-   Synapses that are not used do not persist
-   Neural pruning involves the loss of unusedÂ neurons
-   The plasticity of the nervous system allows it to change with
    experience

Applications:

-   Incomplete closure of the embryonic neural tube can cause spina
    bifida

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Neurons are initially produced by differentiation in the neural
tube

Â  Â Â 
The neural tube containsÂ multipotent neuronal stem cells which can
differentiate to form the different types of nerve cells:

-   Neurons are specialised nerve cells that conduct messages â€“ they
    can be sensory, motor or relay (interneurons)
-   Glial cells provide physical and nutritional support for the neurons
    â€“ roughly 90% of nerve cells in the brain are glial cells

Neurons are produced by progenitor neuroblasts via a process known as
neurogenesis

-   Most neurons survive for the lifetime of the individual and do not
    proliferate following embryogenesis (they are 'post-mitoticâ€™)
-   Certain brain regions may be capable of adult neurogenesis, but most
    of the nervous system is incapable of regeneration

Neuron Production via Neurogenesis

[neurogenesis]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Immature neurons migrate to a final location

Â  Â Â 
Immature neurons must migrate in order to adopt precise final positions
that allow for the formation of neural circuitries

-   This migration process is critical for the development of brain and
    spinal architecture

Neural migration may occur via one of two distinct processes â€“ glial
guidance or somal translocation

-   Glial cells may provide a scaffolding network along which an
    immature neuron can be directed to its final location
-   Alternatively, the neuron may form an extension at the cellâ€™s
    perimeter and then translocate its soma along this length

Mechanisms of Neural Migration

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â An axon grows from each immatureÂ neuron in response to chemical
stimuli

â€¢ Â Some axons extend beyond the neural tube to reach other parts of
the body

Â  Â Â 
An immature neuron consists of a cell body (soma) containing a nucleus
and cytoplasm

-   Axons and dendrites will grow from each immature neuron in response
    to chemical signals from surrounding cells
-   Some axons may be quite short (within the CNS) but others may extend
    to other parts of the body (within the PNS)

An axon has a growth cone at its tip that contains highly motile growth
filaments calledÂ filipodia

-   Extension of theseÂ filipodia causes the expansion of the internal
    cytoskeleton within the growth cone â€“ resulting in growth
-   The direction of this expansion is controlled by chemical stimuli
    released from surrounding cells
-   These cells may release chemoattractant signals (grow towards) or
    chemorepellant signals (grow away)
-   Using these molecular guidance signals, axonÂ growth cones may
    navigate long distances to reach specific targets

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The plasticity of the nervous system allows it to change with
experience

Â  Â Â 
Neuroplasticity describes the capacity for the nervous system to change
and rewire its synaptic connections

-   Neuroplasticity enables individuals to reinforce certain connections
    (learning) or circumvent damaged regions

This adaptive response is achieved via two primary mechanisms â€“
rerouting and sprouting

-   Rerouting involves creating re-establishing an existing nervous
    connection via an alternative neural pathway
-   Sprouting involves the growth of new axon or dendrite fibres to
    enable new neural connections to be formed

This reorganisation of the architecture of the nervous system enables
memory retention and learning

Neurulation

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The neural tube of embryonic chordates is formed by infolding of
ectoderm followed by elongation of the tube

Â  Â Â 
The development of a fully-formed organism from a fertilised egg is
called embryogenesis

-   All tissues are derived from three initial germ layers (ectoderm,
    mesoderm, endoderm) formed via gastrulation
-   In chordates, a flexible notochord will develop during gastrulation
    and lead to the subsequent formation of a neural tube

The formation of a neural tube in embryonic chordates occurs via the
process of neurulation

-   Cells located in the outer germ layer (ectoderm) differentiate to
    form a neural plate
-   The neural plate then bends dorsally, folding inwards to form a
    groove flanked by a neural crest
-   The infolded groove closes off and separates from the neural crest
    to form the neural tube
-   The neural tube will elongate as the embryo develops and form the
    central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
-   The cells of the neural crest will differentiate to form the
    components of the peripheral nervous system

Overview of Neurulation

[neurulation]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram of embryonic tissues in Xenopus, used as
an animal model, during neurulation

Â  Â Â 
Xenopus are a genus of frog that possess robust embryos that can
tolerate extensive manipulation

-   This makes them a suitable animal models for investigating the
    developmental stages ofÂ embryogenesis

During neurulation, the following embryonic tissues should be easily
identifiable:

-   Three germ layers (outer = ectoderm ; middle = mesoderm ; inner =
    endoderm)
-   A hollow cavity called the archenteron (will develop into the
    digestive tract)
-   Notochord (flexible rod that stimulates neurulation)
-   Neural tube (developed from the infolding of the neural plate)

Spina Bifida

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Incomplete closure of the embryonic neural tube can cause spina
bifida

Â  Â Â 
Closure of the neural tube does not occur simultaneously along the
entire length of the embryo

-   The area where the brain forms is well advanced over the caudal
    (tail) region, where closure occurs more slowly

Spina bifida is a birth defect resulting in the incomplete closure of
the neural tube (and associated vertebrae)

-   It is most commonly seen in the lumbar and sacral areas, as these
    are the regions where closure is slowest
-   The vertebral processes do not fuse, leaving the spinal cord nerves
    exposed and prone to damage

Comparison of Vertebrae

[vertebrae]

The severity of the condition can vary from mild to severe depending on
the consequence of the incomplete closure

-   In cases of spina bifidaÂ occulta, the splits in the vertebrae are
    so small that the spinal cord does not protrude
-   In spina bifidaÂ cystica, a meningeal cyst forms (meningocele) which
    may include the spinal elements (myelomeningocele)
-   In the more severe cases, patients may typically suffer some degree
    of paralysis, as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction

Spina bifida is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and
environmental factors

-   The average worldwide incidence of the condition is ~1 in 1,000
    births, however marked geographic variation occurs
-   Not having enough folate in the diet during pregnancy is believed to
    play a significant role in causing spina bifida

Strokes

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Events such as strokes may promote reorganisation of brain
function

Â  Â Â 
A stroke is the sudden death of brain cells in a localised area due to
inadequate blood flow

-   This results in the improper functioning of the brain, due to the
    loss of neural connections in the affected area

There are two main types of stroke â€“ ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic
strokes

-   Ischemic strokes result from a clot within the blood restricting
    oxygenation to an associated region of the brain
-   Hemorrhagic strokes result from a ruptured blood vessel causing
    bleeding within a section of the brain

Strokes symptoms may be temporary if the brain is able to reorganise its
neural architecture to restore function

-   Following a stroke, healthy areas of the brain may adopt the
    functionality of damaged regions
-   This capacity for the restoration of normal function is made
    possible due to the neuroplasticity of the brain

Synaptic Formation

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A developing neuron forms multiple synapses

Â  Â Â 
A synapse is a junction at which a neuron transmits a signal to another
cell (relay neuron or effector)

-   Most synapses transmit chemical signals, although electrical
    synapses also exist

A developing neuron will form multiple synapses, creating a vast array
of permutable communication pathways

-   Within the CNS, a neuron may form a synapse with another axon,
    dendrite or cell body (soma)
-   Within the PNS, a neuron may form a synapse with a muscle fibre
    (neuromuscular) or gland (neuroglandular)
-   SomeÂ neurons may form a synapse with capillaries and secrete
    chemicals directly into the bloodstream (neurosecretory)

Types of Synapses within the Central Nervous SystemÂ 

[types of synapse]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synapses that are not used do not persist

â€¢ Â Neural pruning involves the loss of unusedÂ neurons

Â  Â Â 
During embryonic and early post-natal development, neurons will form
multiple synapses to maximise available connections

-   As an organism matures, some synapses are used more frequently and
    these connections are consequently strengthened
-   Other synapses are not used as often and these connections are
    weakened and do not persist
-   This strengthening and weakening of certain neural pathways is
    central to the concept of how organisms learn

Neural pruning involves the loss of unused neurons (by removing excess
axons and eliminating their synaptic connections)

-   Infant and adult brains typically have the same total number of
    neurons (roughly 100 billion neurons in total)
-   However infant brains form vastly more synaptic connections
    (approximately twice the number found in adult brains)

The purpose of neural pruning seems to be to reinforce complex wiring
patterns associated with learned behaviour

-   Pruning is influenced by environmental factors and is mediated by
    the release of chemical signals from glial cells

Synaptic Formation and Neural Pruning

[neural pruning]
Types of Neuroglia

There are two groups of cells that comprise the human nervous system â€“
neurons and neuroglia

-   Neurons transmit electrical signals around the body, while neuroglia
    function to provide nourishment and support

There are a number of different neuroglia within the central and
peripheral nervous systems

-   These different types of neuroglia play distinct functional roles in
    supporting the activity ofÂ neurons

Neuroglia in the CNS

There are four types of neuroglia found within the central nervous
system:

-   Astrocytes â€“ maintain the blood brain barrier and preserve the
    chemical environment by recycling ions and neurotransmitters
-   Oligodendrocytes â€“ myelinate axons in the central nervous system
    and provide an overall structural framework
-   Ependymal cells â€“ line ventricles (brain) and central canal
    (spine) and are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid
-   Microglia â€“ remove cell debris, wastes and pathogens via
    phagocytosis

Neuroglia in the PNS

There are two types of neuroglia found within the peripheral nervous
system:

-   Schwann cells â€“ myelinate axons in the peripheral nervous system
-   Satellite cells â€“ regulate nutrient and neurotransmitter levels
    around neurons in ganglia

Types of Neuroglia

Autonomic Control

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes in the
body using centres in the brainstem

Â  Â Â 
The human nervous system can be organised into several sub-divisions:

-   Firstly, the nervous system can be divided into the central nervous
    system (brain and spine) and peripheral nervous system
-   The peripheral nervous system (PNS) can be divided into the sensory
    (afferent) pathway or the motor (efferent) pathway
-   The motor pathway can be subdivided according to whether the
    response is voluntary (somatic) or involuntary (autonomic)

The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes in the body
using centres located mostly within the brainstem

-   Sympathetic nerves release noradrenaline (adrenergic) to mobilise
    body systems (â€˜fight or flightâ€™ responses)
-   Parasympathetic nerves release acetylcholine (cholinergic) to relax
    body systems and conserve energy (â€˜rest and digestâ€™)

Divisions of the Nervous System

[nerve system divisions]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Swallowing, breathing and heart rate as examples of activities
coordinated by the medulla

Â  Â Â 
The medulla oblongata is a part of the brainstem responsible for
coordinating many autonomic (involuntary) activities

-   This includes the regulation of body activities such as swallowing,
    breathing and heart rate

Sympathetic ResponsesÂ Â (â€˜Fight or Flightâ€™)

-   Decreases salivary release and blood flow to the gut in response to
    swallowing
-   Increases ventilation rate and dilates airways in response to a
    reduction in blood pH (caused by increased levels of CO₂)
-   Increases heart rate by raising the normal sinus rhythm of the
    pacemaker of the heart

Parasympathetic Responses Â (â€˜Rest and Digestâ€™ /Â â€˜Feed and
Breedâ€™)

-   Increases salivary release and blood flow to the gut in response to
    swallowing
-   Lowers ventilation rate and constricts airways in response to an
    increase in blood pH (caused by lower levels of CO₂)
-   Reduces heart rate (via vagus nerve) by lowering the normal sinus
    rhythm of the pacemaker of the heart

Autonomic Control of Body Systems

[autonomic control]
Blood-Brain Barrier

The blood-brain barrier is a selective barrier that separates
circulating blood from cerebrospinal fluid of the brain

-   It is formed by brain endothelial cells which are connected by tight
    junctions
-   It functions to prevent the movement of large molecules (e.g.
    bacteria) from the blood into the brain
-   Smaller molecules (such as O₂, CO₂ and hormones) can still freely
    cross the blood-brain barrier

The purpose of the blood-brain barrier is to protect the brain from most
pathogenic infections

-   As a result, brain diseases are rare but are also difficult to treat
    (antibodies cannot cross the blood-brain barrier)
-   Diseases that may be associated with the deterioration of the
    blood-brain barrier include meningitis and MS

Brain Damage

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of the pupil reflex to evaluate brain damage

Â  Â Â 
The Pupil Reflex

The pupil reflex is an involuntary response originating at the brainstem
and under the control of the autonomic nervous system

-   It involves the resizing of the iris to regulate the amount of light
    that reaches the retina (excess light can damage the retina)

Pupils constrict in bright light (to prevent overstimulation of
photoreceptors) and dilate in dim light (to maximise light exposure)

-   In bright light, parasympathetic nerves trigger circular muscles to
    contract and cause the pupils to constrict
-   In dim light, sympathetic nerves trigger radial muscles to contract
    and cause the pupils to dilate

Overview of the Pupil Reflex

[pupil reflex]

Brain Death

Brain death is defined as the permanent absence of measurable activity
in both the cerebrum and brainstem

-   The brainstem is responsible for involuntary autonomic responses and
    may function alone to maintain homeostasis
-   Hence, individuals with a non-functioning cerebrum but a functioning
    brainstem may be kept alive in a vegetative state

Brain death can be determined by medical professionals by testing the
function of specific autonomic responses

-   The pupil reflex is one autonomic test used to assess brain death
    â€“ brain dead individuals will not exhibit a pupil reflex
-   The Glasgow Coma Scale uses multiple tests to determine the
    neurological health of someone with suspected brain injury

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The anterior part of the neural tube expands to form the brain

Â  Â Â 
During embryonic development, the neural tube will enlarge and develop
into different components of the nervous system:

-   The anterior part of the neural tube will expand to form the brain
    during cephalisation (development of the head)
-   The remainder of the neural tube will develop into the spinal cord
-   Cells that comprised the neural crest will differentiate to form
    most of the peripheral nervous system

The embryonic brain will initially be composed of three primary
structures â€“ the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain

-   These structures will eventually give rise to the identifiable
    components of the developed brain

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of animal experiments, autopsy, lesions and fMRI to identify
the role of different brain parts

Â  Â Â 
The role of a specific brain part can be identified by either
stimulating or removing the region to assess its effect

-   Identification of brain roles can be made via the use of animal
    experiments, autopsy, lesions and fMRI

Animal Experiments

-   AnimalÂ experimentation can be used to identify function by
    stimulating regions with electrodes or removing via lobotomy
-   Because such methods are highly invasive and potentially damaging,
    animal models are frequently used
-   Experimentation on animals involves less ethical restrictions than
    human studies (although ethical standards do exist)
-   Animal studies are limited by the differences between animal and
    human brains, making valid comparisons difficult
-   Example: Â Animal studies using mice and rats have been used to
    develop drug treatments for diseases such as MS

Lesions

-   Lesions are abnormal areas of brain tissue which can indicate the
    effect of the loss of a brain area
-   Lesions can be identified via post-mortem analysis (autopsy) or via
    scans of the brain (CT scans or MRI)
-   The effects of lesions can be difficult to identify, as many
    functions may involve multiple brain areas
-   Additionally, the brain has the capacity to re-learn certain skills
    by re-routing instructions to other areas (plasticity)
-   Example: Â Split brain patients have been used to identify specific
    roles of the left and right cerebral hemisphere

Autopsy

-   An autopsy is a post-mortem examination of a corpse via dissection
    in order to evaluate causes of death
-   Comparisons can be made between the brains of healthy and diseased
    corpses to identify affected brain areas
-   Example: Â Cadavers who suffered from aphasia (language impairment)
    in life demonstrate damage to specific areas

fMRI

-   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) records changes in
    blood flow within the brain to identify activated areas
-   Oxygenated haemoglobin responds differently to a magnetic field than
    deoxygenated haemoglobin
-   These differences in oxygenation can be represented visually and
    reflect differences in the level of brain activity
-   fMRI is non-invasive and can be used to identify multiple brain
    regions involved in complex, integrated brain activities
-   Example: Â fMRI studies have been used to diagnose ADHD and
    dyslexia, as well as monitor recovery from strokes

Methods for Identifying Brain Functions

[brain identification]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Visual cortex, Brocaâ€™s area, nucleusÂ accumbens as areas of the
brain with specific functions

Â  Â Â 
While complex activities may require integration of multiple regions,
some specific functions are localised to particular areas

-   Examples of brain areas with clearly defined functions include the
    visual cortex, Brocaâ€™s area and the nucleusÂ accumbens

Visual Cortex

-   Located within the occipital lobe of the cerebrum and receives
    neural impulses from light-sensitive cells in the eyes
-   The visual cortex is the region of the brain responsible for visual
    perception (sight)Â 

Brocaâ€™s Area

-   Located within the frontal lobe of the left cerebral hemisphere (not
    present in the right hemisphere)
-   Is responsible for speech production (if damaged, the
    individualÂ cannot produce meaningful speech despite intending to)

Nucleus Accumbens

-   The nucleus accumbens is involved in the pleasure reward pathway and
    is found within each cerebral hemisphere
-   It secretes neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of pleasure
    (dopamine) and satiety (serotonin)
-   It communicates with other centres involved in the mechanisms of
    pleasure, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
Brain Matter

The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can be characterised
by two distinct regions â€“ white matter and grey matter

-   White matter is composed of bundles of myelinated axons which
    connect the various grey matter regions together
-   Myelin acts as an insulator and hence nerve signals are transmitted
    at greater speed through white matter
-   Grey matter is composed of the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites,
    as well as unmyelinated nerve fibres
-   Grey matter functions as the regions of the brain where information
    is processed

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Brain metabolism requires large energy inputs

Â  Â Â 
The human brain consumes ~20% of the bodyâ€™s energy levels, despite
making up only ~2% of the bodyâ€™s mass

-   The brainâ€™s rate of energy consumption varies little, regardless
    of the level of physical exertion by the body

The large amounts of energy required by the brain are used to sustain
neurons and their processes

-   Energy is needed to maintain a resting potential whenÂ neurons are
    not firing (Na⁺/K⁺ pump uses ATP)
-   Energy is used to synthesise large numbers of neurotransmitters to
    facilitate neuronal communication

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Different parts of the brain have specific roles

Â  Â Â 
The human brain acts as an integration and coordination system for the
control of body systems

-   It processes sensory information received from the body and relays
    motor responses to effector organ

The human brain is organised into clearly identifiable sections that
have specific roles

-   The major external structures include the cerebral cortex,
    cerebellum and brainstem
-   Internal structures include the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and
    corpusÂ callosum

External Structures

Cerebral Cortex

-   The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of tissue organised into two
    cerebral hemispheres and composed of four distinct lobes
-   The frontal lobe controls motor activity and tasks associated with
    the dopamine system (memory, attention, etc.)
-   The parietal lobe is responsible for touch sensation (tactility) as
    well as spatial navigation (proprioception)
-   The temporal lobe is involved in auditory processing and language
    comprehension
-   The occipital lobe is the visual processing centre of the brain and
    is responsible for sight perception

Cerebellum

-   The cerebellum appears as a separate structure at the base of the
    brain, underneath the cerebral hemispheres
-   It is responsible for coordinating unconscious motor functions â€“
    such as balance and movement coordination

Brainstem

-   The brainstem is the posterior part of the brain that connects to
    the spinal cord (which relays signals to and from the body)Â 
-   The brainstem includes the pons, medulla oblongata (often referred
    to as the medulla) and the midbrain
-   The brainstem (via the medulla) controls automatic and involuntary
    activities (breathing, swallowing, heart rate, etc.)Â

Internal Structures

Hypothalamus

-   The hypothalamus is the region of the brain that functions as the
    interface with the pituitary gland
-   As such, the hypothalamus functions to maintain homeostasis via the
    coordination of the nervous and endocrine systems
-   The hypothalamus also produces some hormones directly, which are
    secreted via the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis)

Pituitary Gland

-   The pituitary gland is considered theÂ â€˜masterâ€™ gland â€“ it
    produces hormones that regulate other glands and target organs
-   The anterior lobe is called the adenohypophysis and secretes
    hormones such as FSH, LH, growth hormone and prolactin
-   The posterior lobe is called the neurohypophysis and secretes
    hormones such as ADH and oxytocin

Corpus Callosum

-   The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibres that connects the
    two cerebral hemispheres
-   It is the largest white matter structure in the brain, consisting of
    roughly 250 million axon projections
-   Damage to the corpus callosum can prevent information exchange
    between left and right hemispheres (split brain disorders)

The increase in total area is mediated by extensive folding
(gyrification) to form wrinkled peaks (gyrus) and troughs (sulcus)

-   This greatly increases surface area without increasing volume â€“
    allowing the brain to fit within the cranium

The extent of gyrification of the cerebral cortex is a reliable
indicator of potential cognitive capacity

-   Primates and humans have a greater degree of folding compared to
    lower mammals (e.g. rats have a smooth cortex)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The cerebral hemispheres are responsible for higher order
functions

Â  Â Â 
The cerebrum is organised into two hemispheres that are responsible for
higher order functions and complex skills

-   These functions include memory, speech, cognitive thought, problem
    solving, attention and emotions

Not all complex tasks are equally represented by both cerebral
hemispheres â€“ some activities are localised to a single side

-   Speech production is coordinated by Brocaâ€™s area, which is
    situated in the left frontal lobe of the brain

Information can be passed between the two hemispheres by a bundle of
myelinated nerve fibres embedded within the brain

-   These fibres form the corpusÂ callosum to facilitate
    interhemispheric communication

Lateralization of Brain Function

[brain lateralization]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The left cerebral hemisphere receives sensory inputs from sensory
receptors in the right side of the body

Â  Â Â and the right side of the visual field in both eyes and vice
versa for the right hemisphere

Â  Â Â 
The left cerebral hemisphere is responsible for processing sensory
information from the right side of the body (and vice versa)

-   Tactile sensation from the left side of the body is processed by the
    right side of the brain (at the somatosensory cortex)
-   Objects on the left side of the visual field in both eyes are
    processed on the right side of the visual cortex

The processing of information on the opposite side of the body is called
contralateral processing (same side = ipsilateral)

-   Tactile information from the left side of the body is transferred to
    the right side in the spinal cord or brainstem
-   Visual information from the left visual field is transferred to the
    right cerebral hemisphere at the optic chiasma

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The left cerebral hemisphere controls muscle contraction in the
right side of the body and vice versa for theÂ 

Â  Â Â right hemisphere

Â  Â Â 
The left cerebral hemisphere is also responsible for processing motor
information for the right side of the body (and viceÂ versa)

-   Muscular contractions are coordinated by the motor cortex (premotor
    cortex = preparation ; primary motor cortex = execution)

A consequence of this contralateral processing is that damage to one
side of the brain affects the other side of the body

-   For instance, a stroke in the left hemisphere may cause paralysis to
    the right side of the body

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of correlations between body size and brain size in
different animals

Â  Â Â 
There is a positive correlation between body size and brain size in
different animals â€“ larger animals have larger brains

-   This correlation follows a linear pattern of progression but is not
    directly proportional

While an increase in body size results in an increase in brain size, the
brain:body ratio decreasesÂ in larger animals

-   Body mass increases disproportionately to an increase in brain mass
    as most tasks only require a fixed brain capacity
-   While there is a correlation between body size and brain size, there
    is not a correlation between brain size and intelligence

Encephalization is defined as the amount of brain mass relative to an
animal's body mass

-   Scientists have derived an encephalization quotient (EQ), which
    attempts to provide a rough estimate of potential cognition
-   The quotient is only applied to mammals â€“ higher values are
    indicativeÂ of a higher predicted capacity for intelligence

A2 Â The Human Brain

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The parts of the brain
specialise in different functions

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The anterior part of the neural tube expands to form the brain
-   Different parts of the brain have specific roles
-   The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes in the
    body using centres located mainly in the brainstem
-   The cerebral cortex forms a larger proportion of the brain and is
    more highly developed in humans than other animals
-   The human cerebral cortex has become enlarged principally by an
    increase in total area with extensive folding to accommodate it
    within the cranium
-   The cerebral hemispheres are responsible for higher order functions
-   The left cerebral hemisphere receives sensory inputs from sensory
    receptors in the right side of the body and the right side of the
    visual field in both eyes and vice versa for the right hemisphere
-   The left cerebral hemisphere controls muscle contraction in the
    right side of the body and vice versa for the right hemisphere
-   Brain metabolism requires large energy inputs

Applications:

-   Visual cortex, Brocaâ€™s area, nucleus accumbens as areas of the
    brain with specific functions
-   Swallowing, breathing and heart rate as examples of activities
    coordinated by the medulla
-   Use of the pupil reflex to evaluate brain damage
-   Use of animal experiments, autopsy, lesions and fMRI to identify the
    role of different brain parts

Skills:

-   Identification of parts of the brain in a photograph, diagram or
    scan of the brain
-   Analysis of correlations between body size and brain size in
    different animals
Sensorimotor Areas

Tactile perception (touch) and gross physical movements are coordinated
by the sensorimotor areas of the brain

-   The primary motor cortex is located in theÂ precentral gyrus
    (frontal lobe) and handles motor signals
-   The somatosensory cortex is located in theÂ postcentral gyrus
    (parietal lobe) and handles tactile sensory signals

These two regions each form a cortical homunculus â€“ a neurological map
of the anatomical divisions of the body

-   Parts of this representation of the human body are
    disproportionately large as these regions are highly innervated
-   The hands, tongue and lips are very large as these appendages
    require more nervous control (e.g. for speech)
-   Areas with less innervation (e.g. torso) have less of the cortex
    dedicated to their functioning and appear small

Cortical Homunculus of the Sensorimotor Areas

[homunculus]
Edge Enhancement

The human eye has the capacity to see the edges of objects in greater
contrast (edge enhancement)

-   This is why the eye can detect shapes and outlines in dark
    conditions, but not detect finer details

Stimulated photoreceptors will activate opposing bipolar cells but
inhibit adjacent bipolar cells

-   This is known as vertical activation and lateral inhibition
    respectively

This will increase the contrast between the light and dark borders of an
object due to the fact that:

-   The light edge is not being laterally inhibited by photoreceptors in
    the adjoining dark region (hence appears lighter)
-   The dark edge is not being vertically activated but is receiving
    lateral inhibition from the light edge (hence appears darker)

Mechanism of Edge Enhancement in the Retina

[edge enhancement]

Optical Illusions

Edge enhancement can give rise to a number of different optical
illusions, including:

-   Scintillating Grid Illusion â€“ Dots appear to change colour as the
    point of visual focus is adjusted
-   Hermannâ€™s Grid Illusion â€“ Grey spots appear to be visible at the
    intersection between the white lines
-   Simultaneous Contrast â€“ A inner grey square appears darker when
    encased in a white square as opposed to a black square

Types of Optical Illusions

[optical illusions]
Gustation

Gustation describes the detection of taste by chemoreceptors in the oral
cavity (predominantly on the tongue)

-   The tongue is covered by thousands of small bumps called papillae,
    which each contain hundreds of taste buds
-   Each taste bud consists of many specialised sensory cells (gustatory
    epithelial cells), which detect chemicals in the mouth
-   The gustatory cells are not neurons, but will release
    neurotransmitters upon stimulation to activate neural pathways

The perception of taste by gustatory cells is limited, but can be
expanded by olfactory information (smells)

-   This is why food may taste comparatively flavourless when an
    individual has a virus or cold

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Impulses caused by sound perception are transmitted to the brain
via the auditory nerve

Â  Â Â 
Sound travels as pressure waves in the air, which travel down the
auditory canal and cause the eardrum to vibrate

-   The degree of vibration of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) will
    depend on the frequency and amplitude of the sound wave

The eardrum transfers the vibrations via the bones of the middle ear
(the ossicles) to the oval window of the cochlea

-   The function of these bones is to amplify the vibrations from the
    eardrum (can increase magnification by ~ 20 times)

The vibration of the oval window causes fluid within the cochlea to be
displaced â€“ this displacement is detected by hair cells

-   Activation of these hair cells generates nerve impulses which are
    transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain

Overview of Sound Perception

[hearing]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Structures in the middle ear transmit and amplify sound

Â  Â Â 
The middle ear is separated from the outer ear by the eardrum and the
inner ear by the oval window

-   It is an air-filled chamber that houses three small bones
    (collectively called the ossicles)

The bones of the middle ear are individually called the malleus
(hammer), incus (anvil) and stapes (stirrup)

-   The malleus is in contact with the eardrum and the stapes contacts
    the oval window (while the incus connects the two)

The function of the ossicles is to amplify the sound vibrations by
acting like levers to reduce the force distribution

-   Sound travelling through air is mostly reflected when contacted by a
    liquid medium (due to the incompressibility of fluids)
-   The amplification of sound by the ossicles allows the vibrational
    pressure to pass to the cochlear fluid with very little lossÂ 
-   The oval window is smaller than the ear drum, which also assists in
    amplifying the sound energy

Sound Amplification by the Ossicles

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Sensory hairs of the cochlea detect sounds at specific wavelengths

Â  Â Â 
The cochlea is a fluid-filled spiral tube within the inner ear that
converts sound vibrations into nerve impulses

-   Displacement of fluid by sound vibrations activates sensory hair
    cells within the spiral part of the cochlea (organ of Corti)

Hair cells are mechanoreceptors that possess tiny hair-like extensions
called stereocilia

-   The cilia on hair cells vary in length and will each resonate to a
    different frequency of sound (i.e. specific wavelengths)

When the stereocilia are moved by the cochlear fluid, the hair cell will
depolarise to generate a nerve impulse

-   The nerve impulse will be transmitted via the auditory nerve to the
    auditory centres of the brain
-   The kinetic movement of the cochlear fluid (and stereocilia motion)
    is dissipated by the vibration of the round window

Essential Idea:
Living organisms are able to detect
changes in the environment

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Receptors detect changes in the environment
-   Rods and cones are photoreceptors located in the retina
-   Rods and cones differ in their sensitivities to light intensities
    and wavelengths
-   Bipolar cells send the impulses from rods and cones to ganglion
    cells
-   Ganglion cells send messages to the brain via the optic nerve
-   The information from the right field of vision from both eyes is
    sent to the left part of the visual cortex and vice versa
-   Structures in the middle ear transmit and amplify sound
-   Sensory hairs of the cochlea detect sounds of specific wavelengths
-   Impulses caused by sound perception are transmitted to the brain via
    the auditory nerve
-   Hair cells in the semicircular canals detect movement of the head

Applications:

Application:

â€¢ Â Detection of chemicals in the air by the many different olfactory
receptors

Â  Â Â 
Olfaction is the ability to detect airborne chemicals (odorants) as
scents or smells

-   At the back of the nasal cavity is a patch of tissue called the
    olfactory epithelium, which is embedded with chemoreceptors
-   The olfactory epithelium is lined with mucus, in which odorant
    molecules will dissolve before binding to the chemoreceptors
-   Binding of an odorant molecule will trigger a nerve impulse, which
    is transferred via the olfactory bulb to the brain
-   The combination of olfactory receptors activated determines the
    specific scent perceived by the brain

Application:

â€¢ Â Red-green colour-blindness as a variant of normal trichromatic
vision

Â  Â Â 
Red-green colour blindness is a genetic disorder whereby an individual
fails to discriminate between red and green hues

-   There are three different types of cone cells, each of which absorbs
    different wavelengths (trichromatic: red, green, blue)
-   The genes responsible for producing red or green photoreceptors are
    located on the X chromosome (sex-linked)
-   If either of these genes are mutated, red and green wavelengths
    cannot be distinguished
-   As these genes are recessive and located on the X chromosome,
    red-green colour-blindness is more common in males
-   Red-green colour-blindness can be diagnosed using the Ishihara
    colour test

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of cochlear implants in deaf patients

Â  Â Â 
Cochlear implants may be used to stimulate the auditory centres of the
brain in patients with non-functioning hair cells

-   Standard hearing aids are ineffective in deaf patients as they
    amplify sounds but do not bypass defective hearing structures

Cochlear implants consist of two parts â€“ an external part (microphone
/ transmitter) and an internal part (receiver / stimulator)

-   The external components detect sounds, filter out extraneous
    frequencies and then transmit the signals to the internal parts
-   The internal components receive the transmissions and
    produceÂ electrical signals via electrodes embedded in the cochlea
-   The electrical signals are then transferred via the auditory nerve
    to be processed by the brain

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Rods and cones are photoreceptors located in the retina

Â  Â Â 
Photoreception is the mechanism of light detection (by the eyes) that
leads to vision when interpreted by the brain

-   Light is absorbed by specialised photoreceptor cells in the retina,
    which convert the light stimulus into nerve impulses

There are two different types of photoreceptors located within the
retina â€“ rod cells and cones cells

-   These cells differ in both their morphology (shape) and function

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Rods and cones differ in their sensitivities to light intensities
and wavelengths

Â  Â Â 
Rod Cells

-   Rod cells function better in low light conditions (twilight vision)
    â€“ they become quickly bleached in bright light
-   Rod cells all contain the same pigment (rhodopsin) which absorbs a
    wide range of wavelengths
-   Rod cells cannot differentiate between different colours
    (monochromatic)
-   Rod cells are abundant at the periphery of the retina and hence are
    responsible for peripheral vision
-   Rod cells produce poorly resolved images as many rod cells synapse
    with a single bipolar neuron

Cone Cells

-   Cone cells function better in bright light conditions (daylight
    vision) â€“ they require more photons of light to become activated
-   There are three different types of cone cells, each with a different
    pigment that absorbs a narrow range of wavelengths
-   Cone cells can therefore differentiate between different colours
    (red, blue and green)
-   Cone cells are abundant at the centre of the retina (within the
    fovea) and hence are involved in visual focusing
-   Cone cells produce well defined images as each cone cell synapses
    with a single bipolarÂ neuron

Comparison of Rods and Cones

[rod cone comparison]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Bipolar cells send the impulses from rods and cones to ganglion
cells

â€¢ Â Ganglion cells send messages to the brain via the optic nerve

Â  Â Â 
Photoreceptors (rods and cones) convert light stimuli into an electrical
nerve impulse (action potential)

-   This neural information is relayed to the brain via bipolar cells
    and ganglion cells

Bipolar cells transmit the nerve impulses produced by the photoreceptors
to ganglion cells

-   Many rod cells may synapse with a single bipolar cell, resulting in
    low resolution of sensory information (poor acuity)
-   Most cone cells only synapse with a single bipolar cell, resulting
    in high resolution of sensory information (high acuity)

Ganglion cells transmit nerve impulses to the brain via long axonal
fibres that compose the optic nerve

-   Signals from ganglion cells may be sent to the visual cortex to form
    a composite representation of surroundings (i.e. sight)
-   Alternatively, signals may be sent to other brain regions to
    coordinate eye movements or maintain circadian rhythms

There are no photoreceptors present in the region of the retina where
ganglion axon fibres feed into the optic nerve

-   This region is called the 'blind spotâ€™ as visual information
    cannot be processed at this location
-   The brain interpolates details from the surrounding regions, such
    that individuals do not perceive a visual blind spot

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Receptors detect changes in the environment

Â  Â Â 
Sensitivity describes the ability of an organism to detect external and
internal changes and respond accordingly

    impulses which are relayed to the brain and effector organs
-   There are different types of receptors that each recognise a

Skill:

â€¢ Â Labelling a diagram of the structure of the human eye

Â  Â Â 
The human eye is the sensory organ responsible for vision (sight
perception)

-   It consists of two fluid-filled cavities separated by a lens
    (anterior = aqueous humour, posterior = vitreous humour)
-   The lens is attached to ciliary muscles, which can contract or relax
    to change the focus of the lens
-   The amount of light that enters the eye via the pupil is controlled
    by the constriction and dilation of the iris
-   The exposed portion of the eye is coated by a transparent layer
    called the cornea, which isÂ lubricated by conjunctiva
-   The internal surface of the eye is composed of three layers â€“ the
    sclera (outer), choroid (middle) and retina (inner)
-   The region of the retina responsible for sharpest vision (i.e. focal
    point) is the foveaÂ centralis (or fovea for short)
-   Nerve signals from the retina are sent via an optic nerve to the
    brain (no retina in this region creates a visual blind spot)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram of the retina to show the cell types and
the direction in which light moves

Â  Â Â 
The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that forms the
innermost coat of the internal surface of the eye

-   Two types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) convert light stimuli
    into electrical nerve impulses
-   These nerve impulses are transmitted via bipolar cells to ganglion
    cells, whose fibres from the optic nerve tract
-   The photoreceptors line the rear of the retina (adjacent to the
    choroid), meaning light passes through the other cell layers

Skill:

â€¢ Â Labelling a diagram of the structure of the human ear

Â Â Â 
The human ear is the sensory organ responsible forÂ hearingÂ (sound
perception)

-   The external part of the ear is called the pinna, whereas the
    internal part of the ear is divided into three sections
-   The outer ear contains the auditory canal, which channel sound waves
    to the tympanic membrane (or eardrum)
-   The middle ear contains three small bones called the ossicles, which
    transfer vibrations to the oval window
-   The inner ear consists of the cochleaÂ and semicircular canals, as
    well as a round window which dissipates vibrations
-   The cochlear converts sound stimuli into electrical nerve impulses,
    which are transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain

Types of Vision

Accommodation is the process by which the human eye changes optical
power to maintain a clear focus on an object

-   This is mediated by ciliary muscles, which contract to change the
    aperture of the lens (and thus adjust focal distance)

Normally, the light from an object will be focused on the centre of the
retina (at the fovea) in a healthy person

-   However some individuals may be short / near-sighted (myopic) or
    long / far-sighted (hyperopic)

Short Sightedness

-   Light is focused in front of the retina, causing distant objects to
    appear blurry (close objects still appear focused)
-   Commonly develops with age (the ciliary muscles start to lose
    tensile strength, resulting in the widening of the lens)
-   Most common corrective measure is the use of concave lenses to
    refocus the incoming light

Long Sightedness

-   Light is focused on a point behind the retina, causing nearby
    objects to appear blurry (distant objects still appear focused)
-   It is a type of refractive error caused by imperfections in the eye
    (e.g. the eyeball may be too short)
-   Most common corrective measure is the use of convex lenses to
    refocus the incoming light

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hair cells in the semicircular canals detect movement of the head

Â  Â Â 
The vestibular system is a sensory system in the inner ear that is
involved in balance and spatial orientation (proprioception)

-   Within the semicircular canals are gelatinous caps called cupula,
    which are embedded with numerous hair cells
-   When the head moves, the fluid in the semicircular canals
    (endolymph) follows the direction of movement (due to inertia)
-   This fluid movement exerts pressure on the hair cells embedded in
    the cupula, triggering nerve impulses
-   There are three semicircular canals at 90Âº angles to one another,
    allowing head movement to be detected in all three planes
-   The brain integrates information from the semicircular canals in
    each ear in order to identify head position and movement

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Information from the right visual field from both eyes is sent to
the left part of the visual cortex and vice versa

Â  Â Â 
Contralateral processing is when a stimulus is processed on the opposite
side to where it was detected

-   Information from the right half of the visual field is detected by
    the left half of the retina in both eyes and is processed by the
    left hemisphere (and vice versa for the left half of the visual
    field)

Information from each eye may swap at the opticÂ chiasma, so that the
right or left visual field is processed together

-   The optic nerves that swap sides are moving contralaterally, while
    those that stay on the same side remain ipsilateral

Impulses are conducted by the optic nerve to the thalamus, before being
transmitted to the visual cortex (occipital lobe)

-   Thalamic structures (e.g. lateral geniculate nuclei) are involved in
    coordinating eye movements and circadian rhythms

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â The role of inheritance and learning in the development of
birdsong

Â  Â Â 
The development of birdsongs in fledglings is an example of an action
that involves both innate and learned behaviours

-   Birds will use songs as a means of communication â€“ either
    signalling courtship or establishing territorial boundaries

Most birds are born with a crude template song that is genetically
inherited (innate behaviour)

-   The possession of an innate template prevents birds from adopting
    the songs of a different species of bird

Whilst young, fledglings learn to expand and refine their song by
listening to, and mimicking, the adult version (motor learning)

-   Birds raised in isolation will lack the necessary song complexity
    that develops through social interaction

The time taken to develop a birdsong differs between species and songs,
but once established, the final song is rarely altered

Stages in the Development of Birdsong

Conditioning

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Reflex conditioning involves forming new associations

Â  Â Â 
Conditioning is a process of behaviour modification whereby desired
behaviours become associated with unrelated stimuli

-   This process can be achieved via either classical (reflex)
    conditioning or operant (instrumental) conditioning

Reflex conditioning involves placing a neutral signal before a reflex in
order to create an association between the two

-   Reflex conditioning focuses on involuntary and autonomic behaviours
-   It involves associating a desired behaviour with a new stimulus

Operant conditioning involves applying reinforcement or punishment after
a behaviour to increase or reduce its occurrence

-   Operant conditioning focuses on strengthening or weakening voluntary
    behaviours
-   It involves associating a particular behaviour with a specific
    consequence (either reward or punishment)

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Pavlovâ€™s experiments into reflex conditioning in dogs

Â  Â Â 
Reflex Conditioning

Reflex conditioning was first described by Ivan Pavlov, a Russian
physiologist who experimented on dogs

-   Dogs normally salivate (unconditioned response) in anticipation of
    being fed (unconditioned stimulus)
-   Pavlov sounded a bell (neutral stimulus) prior to feeding a dog
-   After many repetitions, the dog came to associate the bell with food
    and began to salivate to the bell (conditioned response)
-   Pavlov described this as a conditioned reflex â€“ the stimulus that
    prompted the response had been changed

Reflex Conditioning in Dogs

[reflex conditioning]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Operant conditioning is a form of learning that consists of trial
and error experiences

Â  Â Â 
Operant Conditioning

Operant conditioning was first described by B. F. Skinner, an American
psychologist who experimented on rats

-   Rats were placed in a controlled chamber (called a Skinner box) that
    contained a responsive lever
-   The pushing of the lever by the rat was accidental but resulted in
    several possible outcomes, including:
    -   The delivery of food in response to light (desirable outcome =
        positive reinforcement)
    -   The silencing of a loud noise from a speaker (desirable outcome
        = negative reinforcement)
    -   The activation of an electrified floor if not pressed in
        response to light (negative outcome = punishment)
-   By trial and error, the mice learned to press the lever in response
    to the different environmental contexts

Operant Conditioning in Rats

[operant conditioning]
Habituation

Habituation is a type of learned behaviour whereby the strength of a
response diminishes when the response is repeated

-   The response is usually an innate behaviour (e.g. reflex), rather
    than conditioned behaviours (which undergoÂ â€˜extinctionâ€™)

An example of habituation can be seen in the response of crows to the
presence of a scarecrow

-   Initially the birds will react to the scarecrow as if it is a valid
    threat (predator) and fly away
-   Eventually the birds will react less and not fly away â€“
    demonstrating habituation

Habituation can even be seen in the slime mould Physarum polycephalum,
which lacks any form of nervous system

-   When introduced by a bitter (yet harmless) barrier between its food

-   This acquired behaviour could even be passed on to naive mould cells
    when the two types of slime moulds fused

The opposite of habituation is sensitisation â€“ whereby the strength of
a response is amplified with repetition

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Innate behaviour is inherited from parents and so develops
independently of the environment

Â  Â Â 
A behaviour is typically defined as any observable action by a living
organisms

-   Behaviours can be categorised as either innate or learned

An innate behaviour is an instinctive response that is developmentally
fixed â€“ it is independent of environmental context

-   Innate behaviours have a genetic basis and are hence inherited from
    parents

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data from invertebrate behaviour experiments in terms
of the effect on chances of survival andÂ 

Â  Â Â reproduction

Â  Â Â 
Any instinctive response that improves survival and reproductive
prospects will become more common by natural selection

-   Examples of innate behavioural responses seen in invertebrates
    include taxis and kinesis

Taxis

Taxis is a change in movement in response to an environmental stimulus
â€“ either towards (positive) or away (negative)

Euglena is a photosynthetic microorganism that requires light as an
energy source and hence displays positive phototaxis

-   Step 1: Â Place Euglena in a petri dish with appropriate
    environmental conditions for survival
-   Step 2: Â Cover the dish with aluminium foil, excluding a few small
    exposed sections
-   Observation: Â With a light source placed above the dish, the
    Euglena should migrate towards the exposed sections

[taxis experiment]

Kinesis

Kinesis is a change in the rate of activity in response to an
environmental stimulus

Woodlice have gills for respiration and tend to prefer moist conditions
(their gills may dry out in dry conditions)

-   Step 1: Â Place a woodlouse in a dry petri dish and mark its
    movements every 30 seconds
-   Step 2: Â Repeat this process for a second woodlouse placed in moist
    conditions (i.e. petri dish lined with wet paper towel)
-   Observation: Â The woodlouse in dry conditions should have a higher
    rate of movement (improve chances of finding moisture)

[kinesis experiment]

Â Â 
Insight Learning

Insight learning is the abrupt realisation of a problemâ€™s solution
through cognitive reasoning

-   It is not a result of trial and error, responding to a stimulus or
    mimicry through observation

Insight learning was first described by Wolfgang Kohler, who studied the
behaviour of a chimpanzee named Sultan

-   Sultan was placed in a cage and a piece of food was placed outside
    of his reach
-   Sultan was presented with a short stick, which he learned to use to
    drag the food close enough to reach
-   Kohler then moved the food outside of the range of the short stick
    but placed a longer stick within range
-   Sultan used the short stick to reach the longer stick, and then used
    the longer stick to reach the food
-   Sultan was never conditioned to use the short stick in this way â€“
    he had demonstrated insight learning

Insight learning is typically seen in organisms with higher cognitive
functions â€“ including primates, dolphins and crows

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Learned behaviour develops as a result of experience

â€¢ Â Learning is the acquisition of skills or knowledge

Â  Â Â 
Learned behaviour is not developmentally fixed and can be modified by
experience

-   Learned behaviour shows significant variation as it is influenced by
    environmental context

Learning involves acquiring information from past experiences to adapt
to new situations

-   The capacity to learn particular skills may be influenced by genes,
    but will not develop without appropriate experiences
-   Learning improves an organismâ€™s survival prospects as they can
    modify their responses to changing environmental conditions

Innate versus Learned Behaviours

[innate vs learned]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Imprinting is learning occurring at a particular life stage and is
independent of the consequences of behaviour

Â  Â Â 
Imprinting is any kind of phase-sensitive learning that is rapid and
independent of behavioural consequences

-   Imprinting occurs during a short critical period in which the
    organism adopts behavioural characteristics from a stimulus
-   Imprinted behaviour is not influenced by consequences â€“ it does
    not require reinforcement to develop

Examples of imprinting include filial imprinting (bonding to a parent)
and sexual imprinting (developing sexual preferences)

-   Filial imprinting was demonstrated by Konrad Lorenz, who imprinted
    baby geese to recognise him as a parental figure

Filial Imprinting

Memory

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Memory is the process of encoding, storing and accessing
information

Â  Â Â 
Learned behaviour is modified by experiences and thus requires memory to
recall and process this information

-   If we could not remember past events, we couldnâ€™t adapt our
    behaviour to new situations

Memory is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded,
stored and retrieved

-   Encoding involves converting information into a form that can be
    stored (e.g. visual cues, sounds, semantics)
-   Accessing involves the retrieval of stored information to be
    actively used in cognitive processes

Information can be stored as a short term memory (short recall duration)
or long term memory (indefinite recall period)

-   Short term memories can be converted to long term via the repetitive
    recall and consolidation of the information
-   Information that is not stored as a memory will be forgotten and
    will have to be re-learned

Many parts of the brain are involved in memory â€“ including the
prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Autonomic and involuntary responses are referred to as reflexes

â€¢ Â Reflex arcs comprise theÂ neurons that mediate reflexes

Â  Â Â 
The basic pathway for a nerve impulse is described by the stimulus
response model

-   AÂ stimulusÂ is a change in the environment (either external or
    internal) that is detected by a receptor
-   ReceptorsÂ transform the stimuli into nerve impulses thatÂ are
    transmitted to theÂ brainÂ where decision-making occurs
-   When a response is selected, the signal is transmitted viaÂ neurons
    to effectors, promoting a change in the organism

Some responses may be involuntary and occur without conscious thought
â€“ these actions are called reflexes

-   Reflex actions do not involve the brain â€“ instead sensory
    information is directly relayed to motor neurons within the spineÂ 
-   This results in a faster response, but one that does not involve
    conscious thought or deliberation

Stimulusâ€“Response Pathway

[reflex pathway]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Withdrawal reflex of the hand from a painful stimulus

Â  Â Â 
Reflex actions are particularly beneficial in survival situations, when
quick reactions are necessary to avoid permanent damage

-   Because reflex arcs donâ€™t involve the brain (only the spine and
    possibly brainstem), reflex actions are more rapid
-   Reflex responses also include autonomic actions such as
    modifications to heart rate, breathing and pupil accommodation

A common example of a reflex action is the patellar reflex (â€˜knee
jerkâ€™ response) that occurs when the patellar tendon is tapped

-   The patellar reflex is a common test employed by doctors to
    determine the presence of spinal lesions

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing and labelling a diagram of a reflex arc for a pain
withdrawal reflex

Â Â  Â Â 
In a pain withdrawal reflex arc:

-   A pain stimulus is detected by a receptor (nocireceptor) and a nerve
    impulse is initiated in a sensoryÂ neutron
-   The sensory neuron enters the spinal cord via the dorsal root and
    synapses with a relayÂ neuron in the grey matter
-   The relay neuron synapses with a motor neuron, which leaves the
    spinal cord via the ventral root
-   The motorÂ neuron synapses with a muscle (effector), causing it to
    contract and remove the limb from the pain stimulus

Addiction

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Addiction can be affected by genetic predisposition, social
environment and dopamine secretion

Â  Â Â 
An addiction is a dependence on a substance or an activity which results
in its repeated and compulsive use

-   Stopping is very difficult and can cause severe mental and physical
    reactions (withdrawal symptoms)
-   Addictions can be affected by genetic factors, social factors and
    dopamine secretion

Genetic Predisposition

-   Particular addictions can run in families, suggesting a genetic
    predisposition (although social factors may contribute)
-   Specific genes might influence the rate of drug metabolism or
    intensity of drug effect (i.e. dopamine secretion)
-   Genetic factors may also contribute to personality types that are
    more inclined towards addictive behaviours
-   The genetic predisposition for a particular addiction may be
    determined by polygenic inheritance

Social Environment

-   Individuals raised in environments with prevalent substance abuse
    are at higher risk of addiction (peer pressure risks)
-   Individuals treated with neglect (child abuse) or suffering
    significant personal trauma are at a higher risk of addiction
-   Certain cultures have a higher incidence of addictions (may reflect
    demographic influences or marketing forces)
-   Low socioeconomic status (i.e. poverty) may increase the likelihood
    of addiction (poor education / lack of support networks)

Dopamine Secretion

-   Dopamine is a neurotransmitter released within the limbic system in
    response to reward (activates pleasure pathways)
-   Certain drugs (e.g. cocaine, heroin) and particular activities (e.g.
    sex, gambling) enhance dopamine activity
-   Long-term substance abuse will lead to the down-regulation of
    dopamine receptors, requiring higher doses to achieve effect
-   Consequently, addicts must continue to repeat the addictive activity
    in order to achieve a diminishing level of reward

Effect of Drug Addiction on Dopamine Activity

Anesthetics

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Anesthetics act by interfering with neural transmissions between
areas of sensory perception and the CNS

Â  Â Â 
Anesthetics act on ion channels to block the conduction of sensory nerve
signals to the central nervous system

-   This results in the loss of sensation (numbness) in the affected
    region, allowing for surgical interventions to occur

Anesthetics can be grouped into two classes â€“ local anesthetics and
general anesthetics

-   Local anesthetics only affect a localised region â€“ usually by
    blocking axonal sodium influx (conduction block)
-   General anesthetics affect the whole body â€“ this may involve
    blocking calcium influx to prevent neurotransmitter exocytosis

General versus Local Anesthesia

[anesthesia]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â The effect of anesthetics on awareness

Â  Â Â 
Different types of anesthetics will affect consciousness in different
ways:

-   General anesthetics will induce a temporary loss of consciousness as
    they interfere with neural transmissions in the brain
-   Local anesthesia will not result in a loss of consciousness and only
    cause a reversible loss of sensation to the affected area

General anesthetics are typically inhaled (to affect the whole body),
while local anaesthetics are injected into specific regions

-   General anesthetics are administered by trained specialists who
    monitor patient vitals for the duration of the procedure
Anti-Drug Vaccines

Anti-drug vaccines are being designed to help substance abusers overcome
particular drug addiction

-   Most addictive drugs activate the pleasure-reward pathways of the
    brain (i.e. promote dopamine secretion)
-   A fragment of the addictive drug is made into a vaccine, such that
    the body produces specific antibodies to the drug
-   The antibodies do not destroy the drug, but form a complex with it
    that is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier
-   As a result, the drug cannot activate the pleasure-reward pathways
    of the brain, eliminating its addictive effects
-   This therapy is currently being developed for a number of drugs â€“
    including nicotine, cocaine and heroin

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Endorphins can act as painkillers

Â  Â Â 
Endorphins are endogenous neuropeptides produced by the pituitary gland
that functions as the bodyâ€™s natural painkiller

-   Endorphins are typically released by the body during periods of
    stress, injury or physical exercise

Pain is perceived in body tissues when impulses are sent from pain
receptors (nocireceptors) to sensory areas of the brain

-   Endorphins bind to opiate receptors on pre-synaptic neurons to block
    the transmission of pain signals

Endorphins differ from anesthetics in that they reduce pain perception
but do not necessarily block all sensory perception

-   Endorphins can also promote feelings of euphoria (as they target
    opioid receptors)

Essential Idea:
Communication between neurons can be altered through the
manipulation of the release and reception of chemical messengers

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Some neurotransmitters excite nerve impulses in postsynaptic neurons
    and others inhibit them
-   Nerve impulses are initiated or inhibited in postsynaptic neurons as
    a result of summation of all excitatory and inhibitory
    neurotransmitters received from presynaptic neurons
-   Many different slow acting neurotransmitters modulate fast synaptic
    transmission in the brain
-   Memory and learning involve changes in neurons caused by slow-acting
    neurotransmitters
-   Psychoactive drugs affect the brain by either increasing or
    decreasing postsynaptic transmission
-   Anaesthetics act by interfering with neural transmission between

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Many different slow acting neurotransmitters modulate fast
synaptic transmission in the brain

Â  Â Â 
Neurotransmitters within the brain can be classified as either
fast-acting or slow-acting according to their action

-   Fast-acting neurotransmitters bind directly to ligand-gated ion
    channels to initiate a rapid response (<1 millisecond)
-   Slow-acting neurotransmitters bind to G-protein coupled receptors to
    initiate a slower response (milliseconds â€“ minute)

Slow-acting neurotransmitters trigger second messenger pathways within
the post-synaptic cell, which allows for:

-   A longer, more sustained duration of action (i.e. ion channels
    remain open for longer to mediate greater depolarisation)
-   Long term alterations to cellular activity to improve synaptic
    transfer (i.e. increased expression of ion channels)

Slow-acting neurotransmitters are called neuromodulators because they
can modulate the efficiency of synaptic transfer

-   Examples of fast-acting neurotransmitters include glutamate
    (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory)
-   Examples of slow-acting neurotransmitters include dopamine,
    serotonin, acetylcholine and noradrenaline

By modulating the efficiency of synaptic transfer, slow-acting
neurotransmitters can regulate fast synaptic transmission

Fast Acting versus Slow Acting Neurotransmission

[neuromodulators]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Memory and learning involve changes in neurons caused by
slow-actingÂ neurotransmitters

Â  Â Â 
Slow-acting neurotransmitters can strengthen the neural pathways
involved in learning and memory

-   By activating second messenger systems, they can trigger
    long-lasting changes to synaptic activity (long-term potentiation)

When a neuron is repetitively stimulated by slow-acting
neurotransmitters, second messengers promote cellular changes:

-   There is an increase in dendritic receptors in the
    post-synapticÂ neutron (improving post-synaptic stimulation)
-   There is an increase in the production of neurotransmitters in the
    pre-synaptic cell
-   Neurons may undergo morphological changes to enlarge existing
    synaptic connections or form new synapses

The net effect of this long-term potentiation is that certain neural
pathways become easier to stimulate

-   This makes certain memories easier to recall (i.e. forming long-term
    memories)
-   This makes certain actions easier to repeat (i.e. learning of a new
    skill or aptitude)

Psychoactive Drugs

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Psychoactive drugs affect the brain by either increasing or
decreasing postsynaptic transmission

â€¢ Â Stimulant drugs mimic the stimulation provided by the sympathetic
nervous system

Â  Â Â 
Psychoactive drugs affect the brain and personality by either increasing
or decreasing postsynaptic transmissions

-   Drugs that increase neurotransmission levels are called stimulants
    and increase psychomotor arousal and alertness
-   Drugs that decrease neurotransmission levels are called depressants
    and slow down brain activities and relax muscles

Stimulant drugs mimic the stimulation provided by the sympathetic
nervous system (i.e. 'fight or flightâ€™ responses)

-   Examples of stimulants include caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines,
    ecstasy (MDMA) and nicotine

Depressants reduce stimulation of the central nervous system and may
induce sleep (sedatives)

-   Examples of sedatives include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol
    and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC = cannabis)

[psychoactive drugs]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Effects on the nervous system of two stimulants and two sedatives

Â  Â Â 
Stimulants

1. Â Nicotine

-   Nicotine stimulates the cholinergic pathways by mimicking the action
    of acetylcholine (bindsÂ Ach receptors)
-   Nicotine is not broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase,
    resulting in overstimulation of Ach receptors
-   Nicotine raises dopamine levels in the brain (leading to addiction)
    and activates parasympathetic pathways (calming effect)

2. Â MDMA (ecstasy)

-   MDMA binds to reuptake pumps on presynaptic neurons and blocks the
    recycling of dopamine and serotonin (5-HT)
-   MDMA also enters the presynaptic neurons via the reuptake pumps and
    triggers the secretion of neurotransmitter
-   This increases levels of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft,
    prompting feelings of euphoria and heightened sensation

Sedatives

1. Â Benzodiazepine

-   Benzodiazepines bind to GABA receptors on the post-synaptic neuron
    and increase the efficiency of GABA action
-   GABA triggers the opening of chloride channels to
    causeÂ hyperpolarisation â€“ benzodiazepines enhance this effect
-   Benzodiazepines promote sleep-inducing and muscle relaxing responses
    by the body

2. Â Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)

-   THC mimics the neurotransmitter anandamide by binding to cannabinoid
    receptors on presynaptic neurons
-   Anandamide (and THC) blocks the release of inhibitory
    neurotransmitters that prevent dopamine secretion
-   By preventing the inhibition of dopamine secretion, THC causes a
    sense of euphoria and emotional well-being

Mechanism of Drug Action

[drug action]

Â 

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Evaluation of data showing the impact of MDMA on serotonin and
dopamine metabolism in the brain

Â  Â Â 
MDMA (ecstasy) is a recreational drug known to increase the activity of
specific neurotransmitters â€“ serotonin and dopamine

-   Serotonin (5-HT) is found in regions of the brain associated with
    sleep and emotion and is involved in regulating mood
-   Dopamine is involved in the brainâ€™s reward pathway and plays an
    important role in regulating motivation and pleasure

MDMA binds to reuptake pumps and increases the release of
neurotransmitter whilst slowing its rate of uptake

-   This causes an overstimulation of post-synaptic receptors until
    neurotransmitter reserves are depleted
-   Long-term usage of MDMA can cause adverse changes to brain
    architecure and result in cognitive impairment

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some neurotransmitters excite nerve impulses in postsynaptic
neurons and others inhibit them

Â  Â Â 
Presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that diffuse into the
synapse and bind receptors on postsynaptic neurons

-   Some neurotransmitters generate excitatory post-synaptic potentials
    (EPSPs) by causing depolarisation (e.g. glutamate)
-   Some neurotransmitters generate inhibitoryÂ post-synaptic potentials
    (IPSPs) by causing hyperpolarisation (e.g. GABA)

If the combination of excitatory and inhibitory signals reaches a
threshold limit, an action potential will be generated

Excitatory vs Inhibitory Neurotransmitters

[EPSP vs IPSP]

Â 

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nerve impulses are initiated or inhibited in postsynaptic neurons
as a result of summation of all excitatory

Â  Â Â and inhibitory neurotransmitters received from presynaptic
neurons

Â  Â Â 

The combination of graded potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) in the
post-synaptic neuron is known as summation

-   Cancellation occurs when excitatory and inhibitory graded potentials
    cancel each other out (no threshold potential reached)
-   Spatial summation occurs when EPSPs are generated from multiple
    presynaptic neurons simultaneously to reach threshold
-   Temporal summation occurs when multiple EPSPs are generated from a
    single presynaptic neuron in quick succession

These summative effects determine which nerve pathways are activated and
hence lead to alternate decision-making processes

Types of Summation

[summation]
Types of Neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers released into the synaptic
cleft by neurons

-   They maintain signals in the nervous system by binding to receptors
    on post-synapticÂ neurons and triggering electrical impulses
-   They also activate responses by effector organs (such as contraction
    in muscles or hormone release from endocrine glands)

Neurotransmitters may be either excitatory or inhibitory in their effect
(some may be both depending on the receptor they bind to)

-   Excitatory neurotransmitters trigger depolarisation, increasing the
    likelihood of a response
-   Inhibitory neurotransmitters trigger hyperpolarisation, decreasing
    the likelihood of a response

Major Classes of Neurotransmitter

[types of neurotransmitters]

Examples of Neurotransmitters

Adrenaline

-   Adrenaline is primarily a hormone released by the adrenal gland, but
    some neurons may secrete it as a neurotransmitter
-   It increases heart rate and blood flow, leading to a physical boost
    and heightened awareness
-   It is produced during stressful or exciting situations

Noradrenaline

-   In contrast to adrenaline, noradrenaline is predominantly a
    neurotransmitter that is occasionally released as a hormone
-   It contracts blood vessels and increases blood flow, improving
    attention and the speed at which responsive actions occur

Dopamine

-   It is primarily responsible for feelings of pleasure, but is also
    involved in movement and motivation
-   People tend to repeat behaviours that lead to dopamine release,
    leading to addictions
-   Abnormal dopamine secretion is common in specific movement
    disorders, like Parkinsonâ€™s disease

Serotonin

-   Contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness
-   Is affected by exercise and light exposure, and plays a role in the
    sleep cycle and digestive system regulation

GABA

-   Inhibits neuron firing in the CNS â€“ high levels improve focus
    whereas low levels cause anxiety
-   Also contributes to motor control and vision

Acetylcholine

-   Involved in thought, learning and memory within the brain
-   Activates muscle contraction in the body and is also associated with
    attention and awakening

Glutamate

-   Most common brain neurotransmitter
-   Regulates development and creation of new nerve pathways and hence
    is involved in learning and memory

Endorphins

-   Release is associated with feelings of euphoria and a reduction in
    pain (bodyâ€™s natural 'pain killersâ€™)
-   Released during exercise, excitement and sex
Altruism

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Blood sharing in vampire bats as an example of the development of
altruistic behaviour by natural selection

Â  Â Â 
Altruism is behaviour which benefits another individual at the cost of
the performer

-   Ostensibly, it is in opposition to natural selection as it reduces
    the potential for the altruistic individual passing on their genes
-   However, it improves the chances of the other individual passing on
    genes into the same gene pool (i.e. inclusive fitness)

If the individuals are closely related, altruistic genes will persist in
the gene pool and be naturally selected

-   Enhancing the reproductive success of relatives who share common
    genes is called kin selection
-   Organisms that live in social clusters will also promote the
    conservation of altruistic genes viaÂ reciprocal altruism

The occurrence of altruistic behaviours will be determined by three
factors (known as Hamiltonâ€™s rule: rB > C)

-   The cost to the performer (C) should be small, while the benefit to
    a receiver (B) and degree of relatedness (r) should be large

Hamiltonâ€™s Rule

[hamiltons rule]

Â 

Blood Sharing Among Vampire Bats

Vampire bats commonly regurgitate blood to share with unlucky roost
mates who were unable to gain independentÂ sustenance

-   Vampire bats cannot survive multiple successive days without food,
    however food can often be difficult to find
-   The small cost of sharing blood (lost time until starvation) is less
    than the benefit received (time gained)
-   Hence sharing blood improves the fitness of the entire brood (via
    reciprocal altruism), increasing the occurrence of altruism

Application:

â€¢ Â Breeding strategies in coho salmon populations as an example of
behaviour affecting chances of survivalÂ 

Â  Â Â and reproduction

Â  Â Â 
Breeding Strategies

Male coho salmon form two different breeding populations according to
the strategy used for passing on genes:

-   All males initially undergo a development phase as juveniles in
    which they grow within freshwater rivers (~12 months)
-   Following that, the males migrate out to the ocean for a period of
    maturation, whereby they differentiate into two populations

Some of the male salmon develop intoÂ â€˜jacksâ€™, while other male
salmon will develop intoÂ â€˜hooknoses'

-   Jacks are smaller and well camouflaged â€“ they only require ~ 6
    months in the seawater to reach maturity
-   Hooknoses are larger and brightly coloured â€“ they require ~ 18
    months in the seawater to reach maturity

Jacks and hooknoses employ different breeding strategies in order to
successfully reproduce with female coho salmon:

-   Jacks sneak out from behind rocks or recesses in the riverbed and
    attempt to stealthily mate with a female
-   Hooknoses swim within the open water and fight aggressively amongst
    one another for the opportunity to mate

Having two breeding pathways improves the rates of successful
reproduction and also increases levels of genetic variation

-   Jacks have higher rates of survival (as they spend less time in
    seawater), but have more competition for reproduction
-   Hooknoses have lower rates of survival but consequently experience
    less direct competition for successful mating

Application:

â€¢ Â Courtship in birds of paradise as an example of mate selection

Â  Â Â 
Mate Selection

Courtship describes a set of behavioural patterns whereby potential
mates inform each other of a readiness to reproduce

-   Courtship stimuli may be species-specific and will be performed
    differently by different individuals
-   Courtship stimuli are often competitive among males and form the
    basis of assessment by females

Courtship behaviour is especially pronounced in the different species of
birds of paradise

-   Whereas females appear drab, males will have bright plumage and
    display fancy behaviours to demonstrate their virility
-   While these features make them a target for predators, they improve

â€¢ Â Synchronised oestrus in female lions in a pride as an example of
innate behaviour that increases theÂ 

Â  Â Â chances of survival and reproduction of offspring

Â  Â Â 
Synchronised Oestrus

Female lions synchronise their sexual receptiveness (oestrus) to
increase chances of survival and reproduction of offspring

-   Lionesses remain in the same pride their entire lives, living with
    genetic relatives (sisters, aunts, nieces)
-   Male lions leave their birth group at a young age and in order to
    reproduce must replace males in existing prides
-   Upon establishing dominance within a pride, a male lion will kill
    all cubs already present
-   The loss of cubs triggers an innate, synchronised response whereby
    all lionesses enter a period of oestrus
-   This synchronised oestrus is mediated by pheromone signals

There are many advantages to synchronising oestrus:

-   It increases the number of offspring the male lion can produce
    (risks of displacement are always present)
-   It allows for shared lactation and nursing of cubs within the pride
    (all female lions nurse indiscriminately)
-   It is easier for the lionesses to hunt and defend the pride if all
    cubs are of a comparable age

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ethology is the study of animal behaviour in natural conditions

Â  Â Â 
Ethology is the scientific study of animal behaviour under natural
conditions (i.e. observational not experimental)

-   As it is a biological perspective, behaviour is considered to be an
    evolutionary adaptive trait developed via natural selection

The modern field of ethology includes a number of well-known
investigations into animal behaviour:

-   Migratory patterns in birds (such as blackcaps)
-   Reciprical altruism in animal species (such as vampire bats)
-   Breeding and courtship strategies in a number of different animals

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural selection can change the frequency of observed animal
behaviour

â€¢ Â Behaviour that increases the chances of survival and reproduction
become more prevalent in a population

Â  Â Â 
Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution by which the frequency of
inherited traits change as a result of external agents

-   Characteristics which promote survival and reproduction (i.e.
    beneficial alleles) become more prevalent in a population

Any behaviour that has a genetic basis (i.e. innate) and confers
reproductive success will become more common

-   Learned behaviours may also evolve via natural selection if the
    capacity for learning has a genetic basis (e.g. language)

Natural selection will promoteÂ â€œoptimalâ€?Â behaviours for the given
set of environmental conditions in which the organism lives

-   As these external conditions change, the frequency of certain
    behavioural responses will vary accordingly

An example of the evolution of behaviour via natural selection can be
demonstrated by the feeding habits of fledgling birds

-   Within a nest, baby birds (chicks) will gape andÂ chirp as
    fledglings in order to be fed by their parents
-   The chicks that chirp louder and gape more obviously are more likely
    to receive parental attention and be fed more
-   These chicks are more likely to survive and pass their alleles for
    chirping and gaping on to their offspring
-   Over many generations, the frequency of excessively overt chirping
    and gaping behaviours has increased

Application:

â€¢ Â Foraging behaviour in shore crabs as an example of increasing
chances of survival by optimal prey choice

Â  Â Â 
Foraging is the act of searching for (and potentially finding) food
resources in nature

-   As availability and abundance of food resources vary, animals must
    adapt their foraging practices to account for any changes
-   Animals with optimal foraging strategies will have more available
    energy with which to survive and reproduceÂ 

According to the optimal foraging theory, animals will adopt strategies
that:

-   Minimise the cost of foraging (i.e. the amount of energy used to
    capture and consume prey)
-   Maximise the benefits to the consumer (i.e. the amount of energy
    yielded by a particular food source)

Shore crabs demonstrate selectivity in the type of mussel foraged when
the mussel population is abundant:

-   Crabs will ignore smaller mussels (as the energy yield is less than
    that obtained from larger mussels)
-   Crabs will also ignore larger mussels (difficult to crush, also
    risks potential damage to the crabâ€™s claws)
-   Crabs will selectively identify and feed on mid-sized mussels
    (provided the mussel supply is in abundance)Â

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Learned behaviour can spread through a population or be lost from
it more rapidly than innate behaviour

Â  Â Â 
Learned behaviour describes the process of acquiring new knowledge or
skills (which can be improved with practice)

-   Learned behaviour is dependent on environmental context and can
    disappear over time if the context is absent

Innate behaviour describes instinctive responses that are ingrained in
an animal (it is encoded in the DNA)

-   It can only be modified by genetic change (mutation) which would
    take place over many generations

Properties of Innate versus Learned Behaviour

[behaviour comparison]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Feeding on cream from milk bottles in blue tits as an example of
the development and loss of learned

Â  Â Â behaviour

Â  Â Â 
At the start of the 20th century, two bird species in the UK â€“ blue
tits and robins â€“ would feed on cream from milk bottles

-   These bottles had no lids, allowing the birds easy access to the top
    layer of cream

Eventually, aluminium seals were placed over the tops of the milk
bottles to close access to this food source

-   The blue tit population as a whole learnt how to penetrate the foil
    lids, whereas the robins as a population did not

This difference in learning development is attributed to the different
social organisation of the two bird populations

-   Blue tits are flock birds and hence were more likely to observe and
    pass on newly acquired skills
-   Robins are territorial (solitary) birds and could not effectively
    propagate the information within the population

The ability to pierce the seals and siphon the cream has since been lost
from the blue tit population

-   Milk is now capped with a plastic lid and is no longer delivered so
    the situational context is no longer present
-   Blue tits have a relatively short life span, so a learned behaviour
    can be removed from the population rapidly

Application:

â€¢ Â Migratory behaviours in blackcaps as an example of the genetic
basis of behaviour and its change by

Â  Â Â natural selection

Â  Â Â 
The blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) exhibits behavioural variation in its
seasonal migratory patterns

-   This behaviour is genetically predetermined and not learned (i.e. it
    is instinctive / innate)

Genetic Basis of Migratory Behaviours

The migratory behaviours in blackcaps has been demonstrated to have a
genetic basis via a number of experiments

-   Chicks raised in isolation will follow the migratory routes of their
    parents (hence it is an innate trait andÂ notÂ learned)
-   Hybrid chicks of parents with different migration routes will
    migrate in a direction between the two parental directions
    -   This suggests heterozygote hybrids exhibit a combination of the
        migratory tendencies from each homozygous parent

Experiment Demonstrating the Genetic Basis of Migratory Behaviours

[blackcap genetics]

Natural Selection of Migratory Behaviours

Blackcaps occupy summer breeding grounds in Germany, but migrate to
different locations during the winter months

-   Historically, most birds migrated south to Spain in the winter, with
    a minority migrating west to the UK
-   Spain is further away but has generally had a more temperate winter
    climate than the UK, improving reproductive success

With an increase in global temperatures, the migratory patterns of
blackcaps are changing due to natural selection

-   Blackcap populations in the UK are rising, as warmer temperatures
    are improving survival rates during the winter months
-   UK blackcaps are reproducing more, as the shorter migration allows
    them to select the best breeding territories in Germany

Migratory Patterns of European Blackcaps

[blackcap migration]
Sexual Dimorphism

Sexual dimorphism describes differences in the physical characteristics
of the two sexes (beyond sex organs)

-   These differences may be subtle or exaggerated, and include size,
    colours, markings and behaviours

Sexual dimorphism has evolved as a result of differential mate selection
in males and females of a species

-   Exaggerated traits (ornaments) are more likely to attract female
    attention, despite increasing exposure to predators
-   Over many generations, these traits have become more pronounced,
    leading to marked differences between sexes

Examples of sexual dimorphism can be seen in a number of animals:

-   Many species of birds show clear differences between males and
    females of the species (e.g. peacock and peahen)
-   Male and female deer can be differentiated by the presence of large
    antlers on the male stags
-   Even humans demonstrate clear sexual dimorphism (e.g. facial hair
    and other secondary sex characteristics)

Sexual Dimorphism in Birds

[sexual dimorphism]
Social Hierarchies

Many organisms form social clusters as their survival prospects are
improved by cooperative group organisation

-   Such social traits are more likely to be passed on to subsequent
    generations and become frequent in the gene pool
-   Types of social organisations include eusociality and dominance
    hierarchies

Eusociality

Eusociality involvesÂ a reproductive division of labour and occurs in
honey bee colonies where a caste system exists

-   A single queen bee (reproductive female) is responsible for the
    production of eggs
-   A few drone bees (reproductive males) are responsible for the
    fertilisation of the eggs
-   The majority of bees are workers (sterile females) and may be
    subdivided into various castes - foragers, soldiers, etc.

Eusocial Organisation of Honey Bees

[eusociality]

Dominance Hierarchies

Baboons live and interact in small groups called troops (10 - 20
members) organised according toÂ physical dominance

-   Troops are structured around dominant females who rank as leaders,
    while males will move in and out of troops
-   Members of the troop do not share food, each individual is
    responsible for themselves (no division of labour)
-   Baboons have no mating season, so females are readily available and
    highly promiscuous (will take many partners)
-   Males will form relationships with females through social activities
    such as grooming, and may help to defend females and infants

Animal Survival

There are a number of limiting factors that affect the distribution of
animal species within a community

-   These include temperature, territory for feeding and breeding, water
    access and food supply

Temperature

-   Animal survival typically relies on a narrow temperature range â€“
    few animals can survive temperature extremes
-   Poikilotherms cannot maintain thermal homeostasis and must occupy
    environments according to temperature needs
-   Homeotherms can regulate their own internal body temperatures and
    hence can occupy a wider range of habitats
-   Body size will play a fundamental role in determining an animalâ€™s
    capacity to retain heat (i.e. SA:Vol ratio)

Territory

-   Territorial boundaries may determine an animals capacity to attract
    mates, rear young, forage for food and avoid predators
-   Territories may be temporary (e.g. migration / breeding sites) or
    alternatively may be permanent
-   In certain species, juveniles may have different environmental
    requirements to adults (e.g. tadpoles and frogs)
-   Establishment of territories can lead to intraspecific and
    interspecific competition

Food Availability

-   Availability of a food supply is a critical determinant in
    influencing population size and distribution
-   Animals may require a particular plant or animal species as a food
    source â€“ limiting their spread to certain regionsÂ 
-   Seasonal or geographic variations may directly affect food
    availability within a population (e.g. seasonal migrations)

Ecological Niche

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Each species plays a unique role within a community because of the
unique combination of its spatial habitat

Â  Â Â and interactions with other species

Â  Â Â 
An ecological niche describes the functional position and role of an
organism within its environment

-   It consists of all physical and biological conditions which
    determine the organismâ€™s survival and reproductive prospects

An ecological niche will be comprised of various components, including:

-   The habitat in which an organism lives
-   The activity patterns of the organism (e.g. periods of time during
    which it is active)
-   The resources it obtains from the environment (e.g. food sources,
    territorial boundaries, etc.)
-   The interactions that occur with other species in the community
    (e.g. predator prey relationships, competition, etc.)

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Two species cannot survive indefinitely in the same habitat if
their niches are identical

Â  Â Â 
If two distinct species share an identical niche, there will be
interspecific competition for available space and resources

-   This competition between the two species will result in the fitness
    of one being lowered by the presence of the other
-   Inevitably, the less well-adapted species will struggle to survive
    and reproduce â€“ it will eventually be eliminated from the niche

Interspecific competition within a shared niche will typically prompt
one of two responses:

-   Competitive exclusion â€“ One species uses the resources more
    efficiently, driving the other species to local extinction
-   Resource partitioning â€“ Both species alter their use of the
    habitat to divide resources between them (i.e. niche separation)

Niche Differentiation

[niche differentiation]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of a data set that illustrates the distinction between
fundamental and realized niche

Â  Â Â 
Some species may not be able to occupy their entire niche due to the
presence or absence of other species

-   Hence a species may occupy a smaller subset of their niche than is
    theoretically possible (fundamental vs realised niche)

Fundamental Niche

A fundamental niche is the entire set of conditions under which an
organism can survive and reproduce (where it could live)

-   It is the theoretical habitat and may not be fully occupied due to
    the presence of competing species
-   In a rocky shore environment, the Chthalamus barnacle can
    potentially occupy the entire rocky shore (if in isolation)

Realised Niche

A realised niche is the set of conditions used by an organism after
including interactions with other species (where it does live)

-   It is the actual habitat that is completely occupied by an organism
    in the presence of competing species
-   In a rocky shore environment, theÂ Chthalamus barnacle only occupies
    regions where the Semibalanus barnacle is absent

Keystone Species

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Community structure can be strongly affected by keystone species

Â  Â Â 
A keystone species is a species that has a disproportionately large
impact on the environment relative to its abundance

-   It is analogous to a keystone in an arch â€“ it fundamentally
    supports the whole structure and prevents it from collapsing

Keystone species may influence communities in a number of ways:

-   Predators â€“ they can exert pressure on lower trophic levels to
    prevent them from monopolising certain resources
-   Mutualism â€“ they can support the life cycle of a variety of
    species within a community (e.g. pollinators / seed dispersal)
-   Engineers â€“ they can refashion the environment in a manner that
    promotes the survival of other species

There are numerous examples of keystone species within different
communities:

-   Sea stars (predator) prey on urchins and mussels, preventing mussel
    overpopulation and coral reef destruction by urchins
-   Honey bees (mutualist) pollinate a wide variety of plant species,
    ensuring the continuation of the plant life cycleÂ 
-   Beavers (engineer) build dams that transform the environment in a
    manner that allows certain other species to survive

Keystone species are not the dominant species (most numerous) within a
community, nor do they have to be apex predators

Keystone Species

[keystone species]

Â 
Plant Survival

There are a number of limiting factors that affect the distribution of
plant species within a community

-   These include temperature, water and light availability, salinity
    and edaphic factors (soil pH and nutrient levels)

Temperature

-   Plants can only survive within a narrow range of temperatures to
    which they are adapted
-   High temperatures will increase the rate of water loss by
    evaporation and may also denature metabolic enzymes
-   Low temperatures may cause plant sap to freeze (the expansion of
    frozen water in the xylem can cause trunks to split)
-   Certain species of woody plants (e.g. maple trees) synthesise
    antifreeze protein to prevent crystal formation in frozen cells

Water Availability

-   Water is needed for photosynthetic processes and is also necessary
    for maintaining cell turgor
-   Xerophytes (e.g. cacti) are plant species that are adapted to
    survive in dry and arid environments â€“ such as deserts
-   HydrophytesÂ (e.g. rice) are plant species that are adapted to
    survive in frequently waterlogged soilsÂ 

Light Availability

-   Light is essential to the process of photosynthesis â€“ whereby
    plants produce organic molecules
-   Low-growing plants will typically possess darker green leaves (more
    chlorophyll) in order to optimise their light conversion
-   Certain seaweeds (e.g. kelp) have pigments adapted to absorbing blue
    wavelengths (red does not easily penetrate water)

Salinity

-   Most plants have a low soil salinity tolerance and can only exist
    within a narrow range of salinity
-   High salinity may be toxic to plants and makes the uptake of water
    via osmosis more difficult
-   Halophytes (e.g. mangroves) are plant species that are adapted to
    tolerate high levels of salinity

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of a transect to correlate the distribution of plant or animal
species with an abiotic variable

Â  Â Â 
Quadrats and transects can measure the distribution of a plant or animal
species in response to an incremental abiotic factor

-   Quadrats are rectangular frames of known dimensions that can be used
    to establish population densities
-   Transects are a straight line along an abiotic gradient from which
    population data can be recorded to determine a pattern

Quadrats can be placed at regular intervals along the transect line in
order to generate population data

-   The quadrats will show the changing distribution pattern of a
    species in response to a change in an abiotic variable
-   This data can be used to identify optimal conditions as well as
    zones of stress and zones of intolerance

Sampling with Quadrats and Transects

[transect]

Transect Data

Transects are used to assess species distribution in correlation with
any abiotic factor that varies across a measurable distance

-   These factors could include elevation, elemental exposure,
    temperature, light levels, pH, humidity and more

A kite graph can be used to represent changes in species distribution in
a clear and effective fashion

-   The relative width of eachÂ â€˜kiteâ€™ represents the abundance of
    an organism at a particular point along a transect

In the example below, animal and plant distribution patterns are
determined along a typical rocky shore

-   Organisms experience varying levels of environmental exposure at
    high tide regions and low tide regions

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Interactions between species in a community can be classified
according to their effect

Â  Â Â 
In nature, no species exist in total isolation â€“ all organisms
interact with both the abiotic environment and other organisms

-   The interactions between species in a community can be classified
    according to their effect on the organisms involved

Herbivory

Herbivory is the act of eating only plant matter (e.g. primary consumers
are considered herbivores)

-   Herbivores may employ different feeding strategies (e.g. mucivores
    feed on plant sap, granivores feed on seeds, etc.)

Herbivory can be either harmful or beneficial to the plant species as a
whole:

-   Certain types of beetle may feed voraciously on the leaves / foliage
    of crop plants (folivores), causing crop failure
-   Fruit-eating animals (frugivores) spread the seeds from a fruit in
    their faeces, promoting overall seed dispersal Â 

Examples of Herbivores

[herbivores]

Predation

Predation is a biological interaction whereby one organism (predator)
hunts and feeds on another organism (prey)

Because the predator relies on the prey as a food source, their
population levels are inextricably intertwined

-   If the prey population drops (e.g. due to over-feeding), predator
    numbers will dwindle as intra-specific competition increases
-   If the prey population rises, predator numbers will increase as a
    result of the over-abundance of a food source

Predator-Prey Relationship (Arctic Fox vs Snowshoe Hare)

[predator-prey]

Symbiosis

Symbiosis describes the close and persistent (long-term) interaction
between two species

-   Symbiotic relationships can be obligate (required for survival) or
    facultative (advantageous without being strictly necessary)

Symbiotic relationships can be beneficial to either one or both
organisms in the partnership:

-   MutualismÂ â€“ Both species benefit from the interaction (anemone
    protects clownfish, clownfish provides fecal matter for food)
-   CommensalismÂ â€“ One species benefits, the other is unaffected
    (barnacles transported to plankton-rich waters by whales)
-   ParasitismÂ â€“ One species benefits to the detriment of the other
    species (ticks or fleas feed on the blood of their canine host)

Types of Symbiotic Relationships

Application:

â€¢ Â Local examples to illustrate the range of ways in which species
can interact within a community

Â  Â Â 
Mutualism

Mutualism describes an ongoing interaction between two species whereby
both species benefit from the interaction

-   Honey bees gather food (nectar) from flowers and distributes pollen
    between plants (mediating plant life cycle)
-   Plover birds pick food morsels from between the jaws of crocodiles,
    cleaning the crocodiles teeth in the process
-   Zooxanthellae (algae) photosynthesise within the protective
    environment of the polypâ€™s endodermis (feeding the coral)

[mutualism]

Commensalism

Commensalism describes an ongoing interaction between two species
whereby one benefits and the other is unaffected

-   Remora attach to the underside of larger predatory fish (e.g.
    sharks) and feed off the uneaten food scraps
-   Monarch butterflies can safely store poisonous chemicals produced by
    milkweeds, discouraging predators from eating it
-   Decorator crabs remove small fragments of tissue from sea sponges
    and uses them as a source of camouflage

[commensalism]

Parasitism

Parasitism describes an ongoing interaction between two species whereby
one species benefits at the other's expense

-   Ticks infest the skin and fur of host animals (such as humans),
    feeding off the host and potentially causing disease
-   Leeches attach to the skin and drinks the blood of the host animal
    until fully engorged
-   Tongue-eating louses eat the tongue of a fish (it may then function
    as a replacement tongue â€“ stealing ingested food)

[parasitism]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â The symbiotic relationship between Zooxanthellae and reef-building
coral reef species

Â  Â Â 
Reef-building coral will form a symbiotic relationship with the
photosynthetic unicellular algae â€“ Zooxanthellae

-   Coral are colonial organisms made up of individual polyps that are
    connected by a layer of living tissue
-   The algae lives within the cells of the coralâ€™s endodermis
    (innermost lining of the animal)

The coral provides the algae with a protective environment and source of
inorganic compounds:

-   Coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate to build a stony skeleton
    which encases the polyps (and zooxanthellae)
-   Coral polyps also recycle the waste products of the algae and
    supplies the zooxanthellae with carbon dioxide

The zooxanthellae, in turn, provides the coral polyps with a necessary
source of nutrition:

-   The algae supplies the coral with oxygen, glucose and other organic
    molecules (produced via photosynthesis)
-   The algae also helps the coral to remove necessary waste products

Mutualistic Relationship Between Algae and Coral

[coral anatomy]

Coral Bleaching

It is the zooxanthellae within the polyp endodermis which gives the
coral its vibrantÂ pigmentation

-   When there is a large scale loss of zooxanthellae from the coral
    (due to environmental stress), bleaching occurs
-   When bleaching occurs, coral begins to starve and will die unless
    the zooxanthellae are restored

Conditions which can cause coral bleaching include:

-   Changes in light availability (e.g. sedimentation may increase the
    opacity of the oceanic waters)
-   Temperature increases (water temperatures in excess of 30ÂºC can
    irrevocably stress the zooxanthellae)Â 
-   Ocean acidification (the build up of carbon dioxide concentrations
    in the ocean can lower pH and stress the algae)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The distribution of a species is affected by limiting factors

Â  Â Â 
In ecology, a limiting factor is a component of an ecosystem which
limits the distribution or numbers of a population

-   A limiting factor defines optimal survival conditions according to
    its effect on a species when in deficiency or excess

Limiting factors can be either biotic (living) or abiotic (non-living):

-   Biotic factors include interactions between organisms â€“ either
    intraspecific (within species) or interspecific (between species)
-   Abiotic factors include environmental conditions â€“ such as light,
    temperature, salinity, rainfall, wind velocity, soil pH, etc.

Law of Tolerance

The law of tolerance was proposed by an American zoologist â€“ Victor
Ernest Shelford â€“ in 1911

-   According to the law of tolerance, populations have optimal survival
    conditions within critical minimal and maximal thresholds
-   As a population is exposed to the extremes of a particular limiting
    factor, the rates of survival begin to drop

The distribution of a species in response to a limiting factor can be
represented as a bell-shaped curve with 3 distinct regions:

-   Optimal zone â€“ Central portion of curve which has conditions that
    favour maximal reproductive success and survivability
-   Zones of stress â€“ Regions flanking the optimal zone, where
    organisms can survive but with reduced reproductive success
-   Zones of intolerance â€“ Outermost regions in which organisms cannot
    survive (represents extremes of the limiting factor)

Application:

â€¢ Â Distribution of one animal and one plant species to illustrate
limits to tolerance and zones of stress

Â  Â Â 
Plant Example

Plant growth varies greatly in response to concentrations of salt within
the soil (salinity levels)

-   Plant species that are not particularly salt tolerant are called
    glycophytes â€“ these plants are easily damaged by high salinity
-   Plant species that are salt tolerant are called halophytes â€“ these
    plants may become stressed in freshwater environments

Most plant species are considered to be glycophytes â€“ relatively few
plant species are halophytes (~ less than 2%)

-   Cultivation of land for agriculture (e.g. irrigation or grazing)
    causes the water table to rise and concentrates salt at the roots
-   This makes it harder for glycophytes to extract water from the soil
    (also, the uptake of salt can be toxic to the plant)
-   Understanding salt tolerance for different plant species is
    therefore critically important to effective crop farming

Animal Example

Coral species form connected reefs that are greatly impacted by changes
in oceanic temperature

-   Coral polyps receive nutrition from photosynthetic zooxanthellae (an
    algae) that lives within the polypâ€™s endodermis
-   The zooxanthellae cannot survive in lower ocean temperatures (i.e. <
    18ÂºC)
-   Increases in ocean temperature cause zooxanthellae to leave the
    coral tissue, leading to coral bleachingÂ (i.e. > 35ÂºC)

Reef-building coral species therefore have a typical optimal growth
range in temperate waters between 20 â€“ 30ÂºC

-   This correlates to the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the
    world (i.e. near the equator)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Disturbance influxes the structure and rate of change within
ecosystems

Â  Â Â 
Environmental disturbances may cause fluctuations to the structure and
rate of change within ecosystems

-   Environmental disturbances may be natural or artificial (human
    induced) in origin

Natural Disturbance

A natural environmental disturbance may give rise to secondary
succession â€“ where one ecosystem is replaced by another

-   Secondary succession occurs when succession starts on existing soil
    following the upheaval of a pre-existing ecosystem
-   This upheaval results in the removal of existing biota and allows a
    new ecosystem to develop on the site of the old
-   Because the soil is already developed, dominance is usually achieved
    by the fastest growing plants

The progression of secondary succession can be summarised as follows:

-   An environmental disturbance, such as a bushfire or earthquake,
    destroys the pre-existing climax community
-   Grasses and herbaceous plants are the first to grow back as the soil
    is already present (no pioneer species required)
-   Fast growing trees will develop to their fullest, while shade
    tolerant trees will develop in the understory
-   Eventually the fast-growing trees may be overtaken by larger,
    slower-growing trees as the ecosystem reverts to its prior state

Secondary Succession

[secondary succession]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Consideration of one example how humans interfere with nutrient
cycling

Â  Â Â 
Deforestation is the permanent destruction of a forest via the removal
or clearance of trees

-   This human-induced degradation of forests is driven primarily by a
    need for timber and cleared land for agricultural purposes

Deforestation disturbs the normal nutrient cycling within the region in
a number of ways:

-   Less trees means there is less evapotranspiration, meaning there is
    less moisture in the air (less precipitation)
-   Fewer trees means less litter (due to less defoliation), which
    reduces the production of humus (so less nutrients in soil)
-   There will be a rapid loss of nutrients from leaching, but less
    chemical weathering of rock (due to less water in soil)
-   The soil will become acidic and release iron and aluminium to form
    an infertile ferrilitic soil (nutrient poor)
-   The soil layer will become increasingly thin and easily eroded once
    the trees have been cleared
-   The infertile soil will prevent vegetative growth, reducing
    biodiversity and further nutrient cycling
-   Logging operations may also alter the distribution of plant species
    by removing the canopy and increasing light exposure
-   Removal of the canopy also results in an increased loss of nutrients
    from the soil via runoff

The Effect of Deforestation on Nutrient Cycling

[deforestation]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Investigation into the effect of an environmental disturbance on
an ecosystem

Â  Â Â 
Environmental disturbances are caused by natural or artificial
disruptions to a normal ecosystem, including:

-   Fire breaks inÂ bush lands or regions damaged by bushfires
-   Outer boundaries of population settlements or regions bordering
    roads
-   Dams and artificial rivers and creeks (e.g. irrigation sites)

The effect of an environmental disturbance on an ecosystem can be
measured in a number of ways:

-   Population density (using the Lincoln index via the
    capture-mark-recapture technique)
-   Species diversity and richness (using the Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal
    index)
-   The presence and distribution of indicator species (to measure
    levels of pollution)
-   Canopy coverage and relative light intensity (could measure with a
    lux meter)
-   Biomass (via the average width of tree stems at a specified height)
-   Edaphic factors such as soil erosion (via depth), water retention
    (via drainage), pH and nutrient content

Measurements taken from a disturbed area need to be compared against
measurements taken from an undisturbed control

-   This enables the investigator to statistically calculate both the
    effect and magnitude of the environmental disturbance
Ecological Pyramids

Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of a specific component at
the different trophic levels of an ecosystem

-   The three main types of ecological pyramids measure species numbers,
    biomass and energy

Pyramid of Numbers

A pyramid of numbers shows the relative number of organisms at each
stage of a food chain

-   These areÂ usuallyÂ shaped like pyramids, as higher trophic levels
    cannot be sustained if there are more predators than prey
-   However, the shape may be distorted if a food source is
    disproportionately large in size / biomass compared to the feeder
    -   For example, a large number of caterpillars may feed on a single
        oak tree and many fleas may feed off a single dog host

Pyramid of Biomass

A pyramid of biomass shows the total mass of organisms at each stage of
a food chain

-   These pyramids areÂ almost alwaysÂ upright in shape, as biomass
    diminishes along food chains as CO₂Â and waste is released
-   An exception to this rule is found in marine ecosystems, where
    zooplankton have a large total biomass than phytoplankton
    -   This is because phytoplankton replace their biomass at such a
        rapid rate and so can support a larger biomass of zooplankton

Pyramid of Energy

A pyramid of energy shows the amount of energy trapped per area in a
given time period at each stage of a food chain

-   These pyramids areÂ alwaysÂ upright in shape, as energy is lost
    along food chains (either used in respiration or lost as heat)
-   Each level in the pyramid will be roughlyÂ one tenthÂ the size of
    the preceding level as energy transformations are ~10% efficient

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of a climograph showing the relationship between
temperature, rainfall and the type of ecosystem

Â  Â Â 
A climograph is a graphical representation of basic climatic parameters
at a given geographicalÂ location

-   It is a diagram which shows a combination of monthly average
    temperature and precipitationÂ (rainfall) at a certain location

Climographs provide a quick view of the climate of a region and can be
used to identify seasonal patterns and changes

Examples of Climographs (Northern Hemisphere Biomes)

[climographs]

In 1975, ecologist Robert Whittaker developed a holistic climograph that
allowed for the classifying of 9 distinct biomes

-   These biomes were distinguished according to their average yearly
    temperatures and rainfall (precipitation)
    -   Deserts typically have high average temperatures but low
        precipitation (hot and dry)
    -   Rainforests typically have both high average temperatures and
        high precipitation (warm and wet)
    -   Taigas typically have low average temperatures and reasonably
        low precipitation (cold and icy)

Whittakerâ€™s Climograph

[climograph]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Comparison of pyramids of energy from different ecosystems

Â  Â Â 
Pyramids of energy show the flow of energy between trophic levels and
are measured in units of energy per area per time

-   The standard units for a pyramid of energy are kJ m^(â€“2) y^(â€“1)
-   Pyramids of energy are always triangular and never inverted as ~90%
    of energy is lost between trophic levels

Pyramids of energy will differ between ecosystems due to the effect of
climate on primary productivity

-   Warmer temperatures will speed up enzyme reactions required for
    photosynthesis (i.e. light independent reactions)
-   High precipitation will also increase photosynthesis as the
    photolysis of water is essential for non-cyclic photophosphorylation

Consequently, tropical rainforests have a high net primary productivity
(NPP), whereas deserts have a low NPP

-   Ecosystems with higher productivity will be able to supply more
    energy to consumers and hence support more trophic levels
-   Therefore a pyramid of energy for a tropical rainforest will display
    a wider base and more levels than a desert

The types of species within a particular biome may also affect how
efficiently energy is transferred between trophic levels

-   For instance, homeotherms will use more energy maintaining a stable
    body temperature compared to poikilotherms

Skill:

â€¢ Â Construction of Gersmehl diagrams to show the inter-relationships
between nutrient stores and flows between

Â  Â Â taiga, desert and tropical rainforest

Â  Â Â 
Gersmehl diagrams show the differences in nutrient flow and storage
between different types of ecosystems
Nutrients are stored in one of three nutrient sinks â€“ either as
biomass, litter or soil

-   Biomass is the total mass of living organisms (mainly plant tissue)
    in a given area
-   Litter is any organic matter in and on the soil â€“ it includes
    humus and leaf litter (defoliation)
-   Soil is the top layer of the earth that is composed of disintegrated
    rock particles

Nutrients can be transferred between nutrient sinks and may also be
cycled via environmental inputs and outputs

-   Nutrients can be transferred from biomass to litter (fallout),
    litter to soil (decay) or soil to biomass (uptake)
-   Litter can additionally gain nutrients via precipitation (rainfall)
    and lose nutrients in surface runoff
-   Soil can gain nutrients from the erosion of rocks via weathering,
    but will lose nutrients via leaching

Standard Gersmehl Diagram

[Gersmehl]

Comparing Gersmehl Diagrams

The inter-relationships between nutrient stores and flows will be
affected by climatic factors (e.g. temperature and rainfall)

-   Hence Gersmehl diagrams will differ between biomes (e.g. tropical
    rainforest, taiga and desert)

Tropical Rainforest

-   Most nutrients are stored as biomass (litter is rapidly decomposed
    and vast roots quickly draw nutrients from soil)
-   There is a fast rate of transfer between stores (hot and wet
    conditions promote precipitation, runoff, weathering and leaching)

Taiga

-   Most nutrients are stored as litter (low temperatures slow
    decomposition which delays nutrient transfer to soil and biomass)
-   There is little nutrient gain from precipitation or weathering due
    to low levels of rainfall (cold temperatures produce snow)
-   There is little nutrient loss via leaching (due to low rainfall) but
    surface runoff may be high at certain times (if the snow melts)

Desert

-   Most nutrients are stored in the soil (few plants exist to store
    nutrients as biomass or produce litter)
-   There is little nutrient gain from precipitation and little nutrient
    loss via runoff due to very low levels of rainfall
-   The amount ofÂ weathering and leaching is negligible

Energy Conversions

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The percentage of ingested energy converted to biomass is
dependent upon the respiration rate

Â  Â Â 
Ecological production (or productivity) refers to the rate of generation
of biomass in an ecosystem

-   It is usually expressed in units of mass per area per time (e.g. kg
    m^(â€“2) day^(â€“1))

Biomass is the total dry weight of organic matter in organisms or
ecosystems

-   Biomass is essentially the entirety of all biologically produced
    organic matter (e.g. proteins, carbohydrates, etc.)

The percentage of energy that is converted into biomass is dependent
upon a number of factors:

-   Energy is lost as inedible materials â€“ such as bones, teeth and
    hair
-   Energy is lost via excretion of undigested and unabsorbed materials
-   Energy is lost as heat from cellular respiration (higher respiration
    rate results in more heat lost)

Primary Production

Primary production describes the production of chemical energy in
organic compounds byÂ producers

-   The main source of energy for primary production is sunlight, but a
    fraction may be driven by chemosynthesis byÂ lithotrophs

Primary production may be categorised as one of two types:

-   Gross primary productionÂ (GPP) is the amount of chemical energy as
    biomass that a producer creates in a given length of time
-   Net primary productionÂ (NPP) is the amount of chemical energy that
    is not consumed by respiration (NPP = GPP â€“ respiration)

Secondary Production

Secondary production describes the generation of biomass by
heterotrophic organisms (consumers)

-   This biomass generation is driven by the transfer of organic
    compounds between trophic levels via feeding
-   Secondary production may also be categorised according
    toÂ grossÂ (total) andÂ netÂ (usable) amounts of biomass

Ecological Productivity

Feed Conversion Ratio

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Conversion ratio in sustainable food production practices

Â  Â Â 
Feed conversion ratios measure the efficiency of an animal in converting
the food provided (feed mass) into a desired output

-   Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) = mass of feed Ã· mass of desired output
-   The lower the feed conversion ratio the more efficient the method of
    food production

A low feed conversion ratio is obtained by minimising the potential
losses of energy for the animal stock:

-   Restricting animal movement (e.g. battery hens) will reduce energy
    lost to cell respiration
-   Optimising feeding practices so that food is ingested and digested
    more effectively
-   Slaughtering animals at a young age (older animals tend to grow more
    slowly and have a higher FCR)

While more efficient food production practices lower costs, there are a
number of potential ethical issues that may be involved

Primary Succession

Previous

List

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data showing primary succession

Â  Â Â 
Ecological succession describes the process by which a sequence of
increasingly complex communities develop over time

-   The climax community is reached when succession has ended and the
    community has all of its characteristics

Primary Succession

Primary succession occurs when communities develop on entirely new land
without any established soil

-   This may occur at river deltas, glaciers, sand dunes or on exposed
    rock

The organisms which first colonise the region are called pioneer species
and typically consist of lichen or moss

-   As the lichen and moss die, they decompose, which creates the first
    organic soil capable of sustaining plant growth

As plant species colonise the area, the litter produced by their growth
and their decomposing remains will cause changes:

-   Soil depth will increase (as plants add humus to the soil) and soil
    pH will become altered
-   Soil mineral content will increase and rocks will begin to be broken
    down by the action of roots
-   The soil will become aerated and water retention is increased
    (drainage is reduced)Â 

These changes will allow for the growth of larger plants, which will
reduce erosion through the binding action of their roots

-   Not all plant species will thrive in unison â€“ larger plants will
    eventually outcompete smaller shade intolerant plants

Overview of Primary Succession

[primary succession]

Primary Succession Data

A primary succession sequence can be identified according to the
distribution of plants at a site of ecological nascency

-   This is any location where a new community may emerge from
    uninhabitable land â€“ such as a coastal sand dune or glacier
-   The regions closer to the site of ecological nascency will be in the
    earlier chronological stages of succession

Glacial retreat exposes bare rock for colonisation, so regions further
from the glacier have had more time to develop life

-   Hence regions further from the glacier are expected to contain
    larger trees common to a climax community, while regions closer to
    the glacier are expected to contain plant life common to the earlier
    stages of primary successionÂ

Sustainable Food Practices

Most of the protein found in human diets (Western culture) comes from
farmed animal meat (e.g. cattle and poultry)

-   These animals need to be fed and housed, creating an ecological
    footprint (size depends on feed conversion ratio)

Sustainable food practices provide food for the consumer while
minimising the environmental impact of the food source

-   The benefits of lowering food production costs must be balanced
    against ethical considerations regarding animal treatment

One sustainable food practice currently being explored is the use of
crickets as a protein source:

-   Crickets have a substantially lower feed conversion ratio than
    cattle, minimising feed costs
-   Crickets require significantly less water to survive than cattle,
    minimising water usage
-   Crickets can reproduce much faster than cattle and require less
    space
-   Crickets produce far less methane than cattle (a greenhouse gas)

For these reasons, certain health professionals are advocating the
introduction of crickets into a normal diet

-   The advantages of crickets as a food source is still subject to
    debate however, so implementation is likely to be slow

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Most species occupy different trophic levels in multiple food
chains

Â  Â Â 
The position an organism occupies within a feeding sequence is known as
a trophic level

-   Producers always occupy the first trophic level in a feeding
    sequence
-   Primary consumers feed on producers and hence occupy the second
    trophic level
-   Further consumers (e.g. secondary, tertiary, etc.) may occupy
    subsequent trophic levels

The trophic levels in a community are:

[trophic levels]

Food Chains

A food chain shows the linear feeding relationships between species in a
community

-   Arrows represent the transfer of energy and matter as one organism
    is eaten by another (arrows point in direction of energy flow)
-   The first organism in a food chain is always a producer, followed by
    consumers (primary, secondary, etc.)
-   Most species feeding requirements will consist of multiple food
    chains, with organisms occupying different trophic levels

[food chains]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A food web shows all the possible food chains in a community

Â  Â Â 
A food web is a diagram that shows how food chains are linked together
into more complex interrrelated feeding relationshipsÂ 
A food web is more representative of actual feeding pathways within an
ecosystem because:

-   Organisms can have more than one food source
-   Organisms can have more than one predator

This means that, unlike a food chain, organisms in a food web can occupy
more than one trophic level

-   Hint: Â When constructing food webs, position organisms at their
    highest trophic level (keeps all arrows pointing in same direction)

Example of a Food Web (Pond Ecosystem)

Types of Biomes

Biomes are geographical areas that have a particular climate and sustain
a specific community of flora and fauna

-   The total area where all living things are found (i.e. the totality
    of biomes) is called the biosphere

There are a number of different biomes that are recognised according to
their specific characteristics

-   These include forests and grasslands (tropical and temperate),
    tundras, deserts and mountain ranges

Tropical Rainforest

-   Hot climate (25ÂºC â€“ 30ÂºC) with very high levels of precipitation
    (> 250 cm per year)Â 
-   Has a large diversity in species and vegetation includes epiphytes,
    tall trees and undergrowth

Temperate Forest

-   Temperate forests (deciduous forests) have moderate temperatures and
    clear seasonal changes
-   They have a growing period of ~200 days during 4 â€“ 6 frost free
    months

Boreal Forest (Taiga)

-   Taigas (coniferous forests) are cold and icy (0ÂºC â€“ 15ÂºC) with a
    small amount of precipitation
-   Coniferous trees are densely packed and there is little variation in
    species

Tropical Grassland (Savannah)

-   Savannahs are warm (20ÂºC â€“ 30ÂºC) with medium amounts of
    moisture, although seasonal droughts are common
-   Trees are intermittent and widely spaced, with occasional fires
    preventing thicker vegetation from encroaching

Temperate Grassland

-   Temperate grasslands have moderate temperatures and moderate amounts
    of rainfall
-   Trees and shrubs are largely absent and grasses are the dominant
    vegetation

Mediterranean (Chaparrel)

-   Temperatures are moderate (15ÂºC â€“ 25ÂºC) with rainy winters and
    dry summers
-   Vegetation consists of dry woody shrubs that are quick to grow

Desert

-   Deserts have extreme temperature conditions (> 30ÂºC during day ; <
    0ÂºC at night) and very low precipitation
-   Dominant plant species are xerophytes which are adapted for water
    conservation (rainfall is < 30 cm per year)

Tundra

-   Tundras have freezing temperatures (< 0ÂºC) and very little
    precipitation
-   Vegetation is low growing (e.g. mosses), although perennial plants
    may grow during the summer

Mountain Ranges

-   Mountain ranges are found all over the world at high altitudes (>
    10,000 feet)
-   Temperatures are typically fairly low due to the altitude, although
    weather conditions may change rapidly

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In closed ecosystems energy but not matter is exchanged with the
surroundings

Â  Â Â 
Ecosystems can be described as closed or open according to whether
matter moves into and out of the system

-   A closed ecosystem exchanges energy but not matter with its
    surroundings â€“ it is self-contained (e.g. mesocosm)
-   An open ecosystem exchanges both energy and matter with surrounding
    environments (e.g. a natural ecosystem)

Open versus Closed Ecosystems

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The type of stable ecosystem that will emerge in an area is
predictable based on climate

Â  Â Â 
An ecosystem is the interaction of living and non-living things within
an area (i.e. a community and its abiotic environment)

-   Particular types of stable ecosystems will emerge in a given
    geographical area according to climate conditions

A biome is a geographical area that has a particular climate and
sustains a specific community of plants and animals

-   The main factors affecting the distribution of biomes is temperature
    and rainfall
-   These factors will vary according to lattitude and longitude, as
    well as altitude and proximity to the ocean

There are a number of different biomes found across the continents,
including:

-   Tropical rainforests â€“ hot and humid environments near the equator
    with dense vegetation and high biodiversity
-   Taiga â€“ coniferous forests near the poles that have cold
    temperatures and little precipitation (moisture trapped as snow /
    ice)
-   Deserts â€“ dry and arid environments that display extreme
    temperature conditions (hot and cold)

Biological Control

Skill:

â€¢ Â Evaluation of eradication programmes and biological control as
measures to reduce impact of alien species

Â  Â Â 
Controlling the population of invasive species once they have become
established is difficult and typically very expensive

-   There are three main methods of population control â€“ physical,
    chemical and biological

Physical Control

Physical control involves the removal or restriction of invasive species
by manual or mechanical measures

-   This may include the installation of barriers and fences or the
    removal of habitat by excavation or trimming
-   Population numbers may be reduced by hunting, trapping and culling,
    although these methods are labour intensive
-   Physical methods to contain invasive species are not usually species
    specific and can also impede endemic wildlife

Chemical Control

Chemical control involves the use of chemical agents (poisons and
toxins) to limit population numbers and spread

-   Chemical agents may include herbicides (for plants), pesticides (for
    insects) or other compounds (e.g. rat poison)
-   Chemical agents may have moderate specificity, but can also
    detrimentally affect local wildlife and are costly to employ
-   The effect of chemical agents may become more pronounced in higher
    trophic levels due to biomagnification

Biological Control

Biological control involves using a living organism (or a virus) to
control an invasive species

-   The biological control may eat the invasive species (predation) or
    cause it to become diseased
-   Biological agents must be carefully assessed before release to
    ensure they do not become invasive themselves
-   Examples of agents include the Vedalia beetle (feeds on citrus plant
    invertebrates) and the myxoma virus (infects rabbits)
-   Biological control agents must be monitored for unintended side
    effects (e.g. development of immunity in invasive species)

Biocontrol Case Study: Â Vedalia Beetle

The cottony cushion scale is an invertebrate pest from Australia that

-   It spread and fed on citrus plants (e.g. orange trees) to such an
    extent that it devastated the Californian citrus industry

TheÂ vedalia beetle is a predatory insect from Australia that was
introduced into California as a means of biological control

-   It worked to limit the numbers of the cottony cushion scale and
    minimise the economic impact to the citrus industry

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Pollutants become concentrated in the tissues of organisms at
higher trophic levels by biomagnification

Â  Â Â 
Biomagnification is the process in which chemical substances become more
concentrated at each trophic level

-   In contrast, bioaccumulation refers to the build up of a chemical
    substance in the tissues of a single organism

Biomagnification occurs because organisms at higher trophic levels must
consume more biomass to meet requirements

-   Energy transformations are only ~10% efficient, so higher order
    consumers must eat more to meet energy demands
-   This means higher order consumers will experience increased
    contamination from a chemical substance

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data illustrating the causes and consequences of
biomagnification

Â  Â Â 
An example of a chemical substance which is biomagnified is DDT
(dichloroÂ diphenylÂ trichloroethane)

-   DDT is a chemical pesticide that is sprayed on crops and
    subsequently washed into waterways at low concentrations
-   It is fat soluble and is selectively retained within the tissues of
    an organism instead of being excrete

When DDT is sprayed on water to eliminate mosquito larvae, it is taken
up by algae and passed on to primary consumers

-   At each subsequent trophic level the concentration of DDT stored in
    the body increases due to increased food intake
-   Very high levels of DDT were discovered in birds that preyed on
    fish, and was found to interfere withÂ eggshell formation
-   Birds exposed to high levels of DDT were found to produce thinner
    shells, which decreased survival rates of fledglings

Application:

â€¢ Â Discussion of the trade-off between control of the malarial
parasite and DDT pollution

Â  Â Â 
DDT was widely employed as a chemical pesticide in the 1940s and 1950s
to control insect-borne diseases like malaria

-   Its use as an agricultural insecticide led to the complete
    eradication of malaria in many high socioeconomic world regions
-   It was less effective in low socioeconomic tropical regions where
    eradication programs could not be sustained

Eradication programs were curtailed by the World Health Organisation in
1969 over safety and environmental concerns

-   DDT can bioaccumulate to toxic levels and poses a significant threat
    to higher trophic levels (due to biomagnification)
-   Current interventions for malaria now focus on non-spraying
    strategies (such as the use of bednets soaked in insecticides)

Malaria versus DDT

Arguments for DDT Spraying:

-   DDT spraying is an affordable and effective means of killing
    mosquitos that carry disease (malaria, dengue fever, etc.)
-   Where the use of DDT has been discontinued, the incidence of malaria
    and associated deaths have increased
-   Health costs associated with the treatment of malaria are reduced
    when DDT spraying is implemented
-   Alternative strategies are not as cost-effective or successful

Arguments against DDT Spraying:

-   DDT spraying is associated with adverse health effects in humans
    (cancer, birth defects, reduced fertility, etc.)
-   DDT persists in the environment for long periods of time (more than
    15 years)
-   DDT is biomagnified in higher order consumers, which has adverse
    consequences on ecosystems

Chlorofluorocarbons

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are chemicals that have been widely used in
past as refrigerants, propellants and solvents

-   As CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, their
    manufacture and use is being phased out

The ozone layer is a stratospheric region composed of ozone (tri-atomic
oxygen â€“ O₃)Â 

-   CFCs are broken down by ultraviolet radiation to release chloride
    ions that react with ozone
-   The chloride ion breaks the ozone down into oxygen â€“ one chloride
    ion can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules

The Role of CFCs in Ozone Depletion

[CFCs]

Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs UV radiation, however there is a limit
to how much radiation ozone can absorb

-   Regions where the ozone layer is thinner (e.g. due to CFCs) will
    experience higher terrestrial UV levels
-   UV light penetrates tissues and damages DNA, causing gene mutations
    that can lead to cancer
-   It can also damage the ability of plants to carry out photosynthesis
    and kill phytoplankton, reducing productivity

Overview of Ozone Depletion

[ozone depletion]
Earth Spheres

The Earth is made up of four distinct yet connected spheres â€“
lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere

-   The lithosphere (or geosphere) describes all the rocks, minerals and
    molten magma found on or in the Earth
-   The hydrosphere describes all the water on Earth â€“ including
    liquid water (oceans, etc.) and vapour (precipitation)
-   The atmosphere describes the layer of gases surrounding the Earth
    and is divided into sections (stratosphere, etc.)
-   The biosphere is composed of all the living organisms on the planet
    (including plants, animals, bacteria, etc.)

The four spheres are interconnected, so human impact on one sphere will
potentially effect other spheres

-   The release of plastic pollution into the oceans (hydrosphere) will
    impact on marine life (biosphere)
-   The production and release of CFCs into the atmosphere will effect
    the impact of UV radiation on the biosphere

List

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Introduced alien species can escape into local ecosystems and
become invasive

Â  Â Â 
The species within any given ecosystem can be broadly described as
either endemic or alien

-   Endemic species are those which are native to a defined geographic
    region (e.g. koalas in Australia)
-   Alien species are those that have been transferred from their
    natural habitat to a new environment

If an introduced alien species should have a detrimental effect upon the
pre-existing food chains, it is classified as invasive

-   Invasive species typically threaten the biodiversity of the
    ecosystem they are introduced into by displacing native species

Invasive Species in Australia

[alien species]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Competitive exclusion and the absence of predators can lead to
reduction in the number of endemic species

Â  Â Â when alien species become invasive

Â  Â Â 
The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot
occupy identical niches within a community

-   According to competitive exclusion, one species will have a
    competitive advantage and survive at the expense of the other
-   Evolution via natural selection results in adaptations that function
    to minimise direct competition between species in nature

Invasive species possess several advantages that allow them to displace
endemic species via competitive exclusion:

-   They typically possess a large fundamental niche (can occupy a wider
    area than endemic species)
-   They will often have faster reproduction rates (are capable of
    forming a larger population than endemic species)
-   They commonly lack a predator capable of limiting their survival
    (due to being introduced into a foreign environment)
-   They may possess certain features that are suited to the new
    environment (e.g. more aggression, better foraging, etc.)

Impact of Invasive Species on an Ecosystem

[invasive species]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Study of the introduction of cane toads in Australia and another
local example of an introduced alien species

Â  Â Â 
Case Study One: Â Cane Toads

The cane toad was introduced in Australia in 1935 to control the spread
of the sugar cane beetle that was damaging crops

-   It failed to limit the beetle population (as the beetles live at the
    tops of sugar canes where the toads couldnâ€™t reach them)

The cane toad has reproduced rapidly and is now classified as an
invasive species that endangers the native wildlife

-   It has a wide diet and has depleted the prey population for native
    insectivores
-   It secretes a toxic chemical from its skin that has poisoned native
    predators
-   It has carried diseases that have been transmitted to native species
    of frogs and fish

Since its introduction, the cane toad has spread across the northern
fringes of Australia and has proven difficult to eradicate

-   The cane toad has no natural predators in Australia to reduce its
    population size and now number in the millions

Cane Toad Distribution in Australia

[cane toad]

Case Study Two: Â Wild Rabbits

European rabbits were introduced to Australia with the arrival of the
First Fleet (ostensibly for recreational hunting)

-   Australian conditions promoted a population explosion (mild winters
    allowed rabbits to breed the entire year)
-   It was the fastest spread ever recorded for any mammal anywhere in
    the world

Since their introduction, rabbits have had a devastating effect on
native Australian ecology:

-   They have killed native plant species by ringbarking (removing a
    strip of bark that prevents future growth beyond that point)
-   The loss of native plants has left the topsoil exposed and
    vulnerable to extensive erosion from wind and rain

Various strategies have been employed to control rabbit populations with
varying effect:

-   'Rabbit-proofâ€™Â fences were built to try and contain rabbit
    populationsÂ 
-   Methods of hunting and poisoning have been utilised, along with
    efforts to destroy rabbit warrens
-   Rabbit-borne diseases have been released with moderate success (e.g.
    myxomatosis virus)
Plastic Pollution

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Macroplastic and microplastic debris has accumulated in marine
environments

Â  Â Â 
Plastics are a type of synthetic polymer found in certain types of
clothes, bottles, bags, food wrappings and containers

-   Most plastics are not biodegradable and persist in the environment
    for many centuries

Large visible plastic debris (> 1 mm) is defined asÂ macroplastic, while
smaller debris (< 1 mm) is defined asÂ microplastic

-   Macroplastic debris can be degraded and broken down into
    microplastic debris by UV radiation and the action of waves
-   Ocean currents will concentrate plastic debris in large oceanic
    convergence zones called gyres

Plastic debris will leach chemicals into the water and also absorb toxic
contaminants called persistent organic pollutants

-   Microplastics will absorb more persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
    due to their smaller size (more available surface area)

Both macroplastic and microplastic debris is ingested by marine animals,
which mistake the debris for food

-   This leads to the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of persistent
    organic pollutants within marine animals
-   It may also damage the stomach of animals or cause them to stop
    feeding (by taking up space in the digestive tract)

Plastic Debris in Marine Environments

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Case study of the impact of plastic debris on Laysan albatrosses
and one other named example

Â  Â Â 
Case Study One: Â Laysan Albatross

-   The Laysan albatross nests on islands found in the North Pacific
    gyre, where large amounts of plastic debris is found
-   The albatross feeds by skimming the ocean surface with their beak,
    causing them to ingest large quantities of plastic
-   Adults can regurgitate the plastics they have swallowed, but chicks
    are unable to â€“ as such it fills up their stomachs
-   Consequently the mortality rate in albatross chicks is very high
    (estimated 40% die before fledgling)

Case Study Two: Â Sea Turtles

-   Sea turtles will commonly mistake plastic bags for jellyfish (one of
    their primary food sources)
-   Ingestion of the plastic can be fatal â€“ the plastic can become
    lodged in the esophagus and cause future feeding problems
-   Plastic debris can also become wrapped around the turtle,
    restricting movement and developmental growth
-   It is estimated that plastic pollution harms ~100,000 sea turtles
    and other marine animals each year

Biodiversity

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Richness and evenness are components of biodiversity

Â  Â Â 
Biodiversity describes the variety and variability of all living
organisms within a given ecological area

-   Biodiversity can be used to refer to the number of species, their
    genetic diversity or habitat variety (ecological variations)

There are two main components that contribute to biodiversity â€“
species richness and species evenness

-   Species richness describes the number of different species present
    in an area (more species = greater richness)
-   Species evenness describes the relative abundance of the different
    species in an area (similar abundance = more evenness)

Biodiversity (Richness versus Evenness)

[biodiversity]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of the biodiversity of two local communities using
Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal index of diversity

Â  Â Â 
The Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal index can be used to measure the relative
biodiversity of a given community

-   It takes into account both the number of species present (richness)
    and the number of individuals per species (evenness)
-   A higher index value is indicative of a greater degree of
    biodiversity within the community

[Simpson Index]

Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal index can be used to compare communities to
identify intrinsic qualities:

-   A high index value suggests a stable site with many different niches
    and low competition (high richness and evenness)
-   A low index value suggests a site with few potential niches where
    only a few species dominate (low richness and evenness)
-   The index value may change in response to an ecological disturbance
    (such as human intervention or natural disasters)

Practice Question

[question]
Use Simpson's reciprocal index to compare the biodiversity at two
specific locations:
Site 1: Species A = 6 ; Species B = 1 ; Species C = 1
Site 2: Species A = 4 ; Species D = 4

Biogeographic Factors

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Biogeographic factors affect species diversity

Â  Â Â 
Biodiversity within a given ecosystem will be affected by a number of
biogeographic factors:

-   Larger habitats tend to promote biodiversity better than smaller
    habitats (more available niches = less competition)
-   Ecology at the edges of ecosystems is different from central areas
    (e.g. more sunlight, more wind, etc.)
-   This is known as the edge effect, whereby species distribution is
    influenced by the divergent environmental conditions
-   Edges tend to have greater biodiversity, as different habitats with
    different abiotic factors exist in close physical proximity
-   However edges tend to have more competition than central regions,
    which may restrict survival prospects of certain species
-   Habitat corridors between parts of a fragmented habitat can connect
    disparate regions to improve genetic diversity

These principles are routinely applied when setting aside land as a
nature reserve to improve the conservation of biodiversity

General Biogeographic Principles of Nature Reserves

[biogeographic factors]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Analysis of the impact of biogeographic factors on diversity
limited to island size and edge effect

Â  Â Â 
Island Size

The biodiversity of an island is typically proportionate to island size
(i.e. larger islands have greater biodiversity)

-   Larger islands support a greater range of habitats (and hence more
    available niches for species to occupy)
-   Larger islands can sustain higher population numbers for each
    species (increases species evenness)
-   Larger islands have greater productivity at each trophic level,
    leading to longer and more stable food chains

Relationship between Island Size and Biodiversity

[island size]

Edge Effect

The diversity of species within a given environment changes with
proximity to the ecosystemâ€™s boundaries (edge effect)

-   Biodiversity may be greater at the border between two ecosystems as
    different abiotic factors favour certain species
-   However certain species may not be able to thrive under these
    conditions and instead must occupy more central regions
-   The effect of edges on biodiversity will be greatly influenced by
    the particular conditions caused by the ecological disturbance

Conservation

Previous

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In situ conservation may require active management of nature
reserves or national parks

Â  Â Â 
Conservation involves the protection andÂ maintenance of natural
resources â€“ such as trees, water and wildlife

-   Conservation can be either in situ (on site) or ex situ (off site)

In situ conservation is the preservation of plant and animal species
within their natural habitat

-   This typically involves the designation of protected areas of land
    as either nature reserves or national parks

These areas may require active management to ensure that an appropriate
and sustainable ecological balance is maintained

-   Ecological monitoring of species may be required to ensure viable
    population levels are maintained
-   Interventions may be required to prevent habitat degradation or
    competition from invasive species
-   Legislation may be necessary to ensure adequate funding for policing
    and education

In situ conservation offers several advantages when protecting
endangered species from extinction:

-   It allows species to live in the environment to which they are
    adapted and to occupy their natural position in the food chain
-   It maintains the animal's normal behaviour (offspring usually aquire
    skills from parents and peers around them)
-   Retaining the natural habitatÂ prevents its eventual loss and
    ensures it remains available for other endangered species
-   Such areas provide a place to return animals from breeding programs
    as they provide realistic conditions for reintegration
-   Reserves in different areas can share information and provide a
    place for scientific study and developing public awareness

In situ Conservation via Nature Reserves

[nature reserves]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ex situ conservation is the preservation of species outside their
natural habitats

Â  Â Â 
Ex situ conservation involves the preservation of plant and animal
species outside their natural habitats

-   Ex situ conservation may typically be required for critically
    endangered species when urgent intervention is required

There are several advantages associated with ex situ conservation:

-   It allows for greater control of essential conditions (e.g. climate
    control, dietary intake, veterinary care, etc.)
-   It can improve the chances of successful breeding by utilising
    artificial methods (e.g. embryo transfer, IVF, etc.)

Ex situ conservation is also associated with several disadvantages:

-   Such conservation methods do not prevent the potential destruction
    of their natural habitats
-   Species raised in captivity are less likely to be successfully
    reintroduced into the wild (loss of autonomous survival)
-   Ex situ conservation increases inbreeding by restricting the gene
    pool and restricts the evolution of the species

There are a number of ex situ conservation measures employed around the
world, including:

-   Captive breeding â€“ animals are raised and bred in containment
    (e.g. zoos) to ensure survival prospects
-   Botanical gardens â€“ areas devoted to the collection, cultivation
    and display of a wide variety of plant species
-   Seed banks â€“ secure sites that store and catalogue seeds, in order
    to preserve plant genetic diversity

Ex situ Conservation Measures

-   The Indian rhinoceros is a endangered species with only
    approximately 3,500 rhinoceros living in the wild
-   This number was as low as 2,000 in the early 1990s, but has
    increased due toÂ successful captive breeding programs
-   In addition to habitat loss, the Indian rhinoceros is threatened by
    poachers (their horn is considered potent in some cultures)
-   It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list and the majority of
    the species is situated in Indian protected areas (reserves)Â

-   The mountain chicken frog is also threatened by human consumption
    (it is a local delicacy said to taste like chicken)
-   It is now considered to be critically endangered with fewer than
    8,000 individuals estimated to be existing in the wild
-   The frog has been artificially bred in laboratories in England prior
    to being reintroduced into the wild

Endangered Species

An endangered species is one that has been categorised by the IUCN as
likely to become extinct

-   The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) currently
    lists over 3,000 species as endangered

The determination of a species conservation status (likelihood of
becoming extinct) is based on numerous factors:

-   These include the rate of decline, population size, area of
    geographic distribution and degree of population fragmentation

The IUCN has produced a red list, which classifies species into nine
groups:

-   Extinct (EX) â€“ no surviving individuals (e.g. tasmanian tiger)
-   Extinct in Wild (EW) â€“ captive individuals survive, but there is
    no wild population (e.g. Barbary lion)
-   Critically Endangered (CR) â€“ faces an extremely high risk of
    extinction in the near future (e.g. red wolf)
-   Endangered (EN) â€“ faces a high risk of extinction in the near
    future (e.g. snow leopard)
-   Vulnerable (VU) â€“ faces a high risk of endangerment in the medium
    term (e.g. Indian rhinoceros)
-   Near Threatened (NT) â€“ may be considered threatened in the near
    future (e.g. tiger shark)
-   Least Concern (LC) â€“ no immediate threat to species survival (e.g.
    giraffe)
-   All other organisms may be listed as Data Deficient (DD) or Not
    Evaluated (NE)

IUCN Red List

[IUCN red list]
Extinction

Extinction describes the complete cessation of a species or higher taxon
level, reducing biodiversity

-   Extinctions can occur gradually as one population of organisms
    evolves into something else (phyletic extinction)
-   Alternatively, a species may not leave any identifiable descendents
    and simply cease to exist (abrupt extinction)

It can be very difficult to determine the moment of extinction, and so
most categorisations are usually done retrospectively

-   Occasionally species thought to be extinct can be rediscovered after
    a period of time (Lazarus taxa)

Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are considered to be
extinct (estimated to amount to over 5 billion species)

-   Occasionally, natural catastrophes may cause mass extinction events
    (large scale loss of species in relatively short period)

Case Study: Tasmanian Tiger

-   The Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus) became extinct after
    the arrival of European settlers to Australia
-   The Tasmanian tigers would feed on introduced sheep and were
    subsequently hunted and poached by man
-   The loss of habitat to human development and lack of successful
    breeding programs led to population numbers dwindling
-   The last Tasmanian tiger died in captivity in 1936 and they were
    declared extinct by international standards in 1986
-   Aboriginal rock paintings suggest the Tasmanian tiger once lived on
    the mainland, but died out from predation / competition

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â An indicator species is an organism used to assess a specific
environmental condition

Â  Â Â 
Indicators species are sensitive to specific environmental conditions
and consequently have a limited range of tolerance

-   Their population growth or reduction indicates changes in the
    environment, making them a useful means of monitoring change

Indicator species may be sensitive to a number of different
environmental conditions:

-   Lichen, along with mosses, are susceptible to air-borne pollutants
    dissolved in water (e.g. sulfur dioxide)
-   Tubifex worms are sensitive toÂ concentrations of heavy metals
-   Mayfly larva and certain aquatic invertebrates are sensitive to
    dissolved oxygen levels in water

Indicator Species

[indicator species]

Â Â 

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Relative numbers of an indicator species can be used to calculate
the value of a biotic index

Â  Â Â 
Biotic indices compare the relative frequency of indicator species and
provide an overall assessment of environmental health

-   Calculating a biotic index involves multiplying the population size
    of each indicator species by its pollution tolerance rating

[biotic index]

The following conclusions can be drawn from a biotic index:

-   A high biotic index indicates the presence of many
    pollution-sensitive organisms, denoting an unpolluted environment
-   A low biotic index indicates a polluted environment, due to a
    relative abundance of pollution-tolerant organisms
-   A change in the biotic index over time marks a change in the
    environmental conditions within a given ecosystem

Pollution Tolerance and Environmental Pollution Levels

Practice Question

[question]

C5 Â Population Ecology

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Dynamic biological processes impact
population density and population growth

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Sampling techniques are used to estimate population size
-   The exponential growth pattern occurs in an ideal, unlimited
    environment
-   Population growth slows as the population reaches the carrying
    capacity of the environment
-   The phases shown in the sigmoid curve can be explained by relative
    rates of natality, mortality, immigraton and emigration
-   Limiting factors can be top down or bottom up

Applications:

-   Evaluating the methods used to estimate the size of commercial stock
    of marine resources
-   Use of the capture-mark-release-recapture method to estimate the
    population size of an animal species
-   Discussion of the effect of natality, mortality, immigration and
    emigration on population size
-   Analysis of the effect of population size, age and reproductive
    status on sustainable fishing practices
-   Bottom-up control of algal blooms by shortage of nutrients and
    top-down control by herbivory

Skills:

-   Modelling the growth curve using a simple organism such as yeast or
    species of Lemna
Population Clocks

Population clocks provide current projections of estimated populations
based on previously recorded data

-   This information is typically gathered from regional and national
    census data and hence may not be highly accurate

Population clocks may also use established data to assume rates of
change (e.g. growth rate and death rate)

-   This allows the clocks to show dynamic changes to population data
    (although this information may not be very accurate)

While of questionable accuracy and validity, population clocks can be
used as a tool for identifying changing demographics

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Limiting factors can be top down or bottom up

Â  Â Â 
A limiting factor is an environmental condition that controls the rate
at which a process (e.g. population growth) can occur

-   Limiting population factors can exert their influence via either top
    down or bottom up control

Top Down Control

-   Top down factors are pressures applied by a higher trophic level to
    control the population dynamics of the ecosystem
-   The top predator either suppresses the abundance of its prey or
    alters itsÂ behaviour to limit its rate of population growth
-   Top down control results in an oscillating trophic cascade
    (suppression at one level increases numbers at the next level)
-   Keystone species commonly exert top down control by preventing lower
    trophic levels from monopolising essential resources

[top down]

Bottom Up Control

-   Bottom up factors are pressures that limit the availability of
    resources to lower trophic levels (e.g. producers)
-   A lack of resources at lower trophic levels suppresses the abundance
    of organisms at higher trophic levels
-   Population growth will be reduced for all higher levels as the
    suppression of the 'bottomâ€™ restricts energy supply to
    theÂ â€˜top'
-   Human activity can often limit resource availability and hence
    inadvertantly exert bottom up pressure on an ecosystem

[bottom up]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Bottom up control of algal blooms by the shortage of nutrients and
top down control by herbivory

Â  Â Â 
An algal bloom is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of
algae in a water system (e.g. lake or ocean)

-   Algal blooms are typically caused by the sudden enrichment of
    nutrients in the water due to run-off (eutrophication)

Algal blooms generally have a detrimental effect on the wider aquatic
ecosystem:

-   The spread of algae will block out sunlight below the surface and
    reduce photosynthesis by phytoplankton and seaweeds
-   The reduction in light will cause algae to respire instead of
    photosynthesise, reducing levels of dissolved oxygen in the water
-   As algae begin to die, an increase in the numbers of bacterial
    decomposers will further reduce levels of dissolved oxygen
-   Without adequate levels of light or dissolved oxygen, most aquatic
    organisms within the environment will struggle to survive

Algal blooms can be limited by measures that exert either bottom up
control or top down control

-   The most success will be had if bottom up and top down control
    measures are used in combination

Bottom Up Control:

-   Algal blooms can be reduced by limiting the supply of nutrients such
    as nitrogen and phosphorus in the water
-   This may involve reducing the use of fertilisers for agricultural
    practices to limit the nutrient input from surface runoff
-   Nutrient reduction can be expensive to implement and difficult to
    police, as it requires a concerted community effort

Top Down Control:

-   Algal blooms can be reduced by introducing piscivorous (fish-eating)
    fish into the aquatic ecosystem
-   The piscivores will feed on zooplanktivores â€“ and by reducing
    their numbers, will increase the number of zooplankton
-   Zooplankton (such as Daphnia) feed on algae, and hence will reduce
    the population of algae via herbivory
-   Introducing piscivores can have unintended consequences on food webs
    and should be done with caution

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The exponential growth pattern occurs in an ideal, unlimited
environment

â€¢ Â Population growth slows as the population reaches the carrying
capacity of the environment

Â  Â Â 
Two types of population growth patterns may occur depending on specific
environmental conditions:

-   An exponential growth pattern (J curve) occurs in an ideal,
    unlimited environment
-   A logistic growth pattern (S curve) occurs when environmental
    pressures slow the rate of growth

Exponential Growth

-   Exponential population growth will occur in an ideal environment
    where resources are unlimited
-   In such an environment there will be no competition to place limits
    on a geometric rate of growth
-   Initially population growth will be slow as there is a shortage of
    reproducing individuals that may be widely dispersed
-   As population numbers increase the rate of growth similarly
    increases, resulting in an exponential (J-shaped) curve
-   This maximal growth rate for a given population is known as its
    biotic potential
-   Exponential growth can be seen in populations that are very small or
    in regions that are newly colonised by a species

Logistic Growth

-   Logistic population growth will occur when population numbers begin
    to approach a finite carrying capacity
-   The carrying capacity is the maximum number of a species that can be
    sustainably supported by the environment
-   As a population approaches the carrying capacity, environmental
    resistance occurs, slowing the rate of growth
-   This results in a sigmoidal (S-shaped) growth curve that plateaus at
    the carrying capacity (denoted byÂ Îº)
-   Logistic growth will eventually be seen in any stable population
    occupying a fixed geographic space

Types of Population Growth

[population growth]

Limiting Factors

Limiting factors are environmental conditions that control the rate at
which a process (e.g. population growth) can occur

-   Population growth can be determined by density-dependent or
    density-independent factors

Density dependent environmental factors are influenced by the relative
size of a population

-   These factors include predator numbers, availability of food and
    other resources and the spread of pathogenic diseases

Density independent environmental factors are not influenced by the
relative size of a population

-   These factors include weather and climate conditions, as well as the
    occurrence of natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes)

Population Sampling

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Sampling techniques are used to estimate population size

Â  Â Â 
A population is all the individuals of a given species living in the
same area at the same time

-   Populations are fluid and are subject to continual change in numbers
    through natality, mortality, immigration and emigration
-   Populations may be large and impractical to count unless the species
    is large and the target area is small

Population sampling involves identifying individual numbers in small
areas and then extrapolating to estimate population totals

-   Sampled areas must be chosen randomly to avoidÂ selection bias
    causing a misrepresentation of the population size
-   The more samples that are taken (and the larger the sampling area),
    the more accurate population estimates are likely to be

Different sampling techniques are used to estimate population sizes for
non-motile (sessile) and motile species

-   Non-motile species can be sampled usingÂ quadrats (measurements can
    include direct counts, percentage cover or frequency)
-   Motile species can be sampled using the
    capture-mark-release-recapture method (with estimates based on the
    Lincoln index)

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of the capture-mark-release-recapture method to estimate the
population size of an animal species

Â  Â Â 
Capture-Mark-Release-Recapture

The capture-mark-release recapture method is a means of estimating the
population size of a motile species

-   An area is defined and marked off, then a selection ofÂ individuals
    are captured, counted, marked and released (n₁)
-   Marking must not be easily removable or adversely affect the
    animalâ€™s survival prospects
-   After sufficient time has passed to allow marked individuals to
    reintegrate in the population, a second capture is made (n₂)
-   In this second capture, both unmarked individuals and marked
    individuals (n₃) are counted
-   Based on the three values generated (n₁ ; n₂ ; n₃), an estimated
    population size is derived using the Lincoln Index

The Capture-Mark-Release-Recapture Method

[MRR method]

Lincoln Index

The Lincoln index is used to estimate population size based on the
capture-mark-release-recapture method

-   Lincoln Index: Â Estimated Population = (n₁Â Ã— n₂)Â Ã· n₃

The Lincoln index requires that the following assumptions are true:

-   That all individuals in a given area have an equal chance of being
    captured (sampling must be random)
-   That marked individuals will be randomly distributed after release
    (n₁ cannot be allowed to influence n₃)
-   That marking individuals will not affect the mortality or natality
    of the population

The accuracy of the Lincoln index can be improved by a number of means:

-   Increasing the size of the capture samples (larger samples will be
    more representative but also more difficult to collect)
-   Taking repeated samples in order to determine a statistical average

Lincoln Index Equation:

[lincoln index]

Practice Question

gorilla numbers in a nature reserve:

Application:

â€¢ Â Discussion of the effect of natality, mortality, immigration and
emigration on population size

Â  Â Â 
The change in the size of a population over time is determined by four
key factors:

â€¢ Â Natality: Â Increases to population size through reproduction
(births)

â€¢ Â Immigration: Â Increases to population size from external
populations

â€¢ Â Mortality: Â Decreases to population size as a result of death

â€¢ Â Emigration: Â Decreases to population size due to loss to external
populations

The role of these factors in determining population size can be
summarised by the following equation:

-   Population Size = (Immigration + Natality) â€“ (Mortality +
    Emigration)

Population Size Equation

[population size]
r / K Strategies

The terms r-selection and K-selection are used by ecologists to describe
the growth and reproduction strategies of organisms

-   r-selected species have a high growth rate but low survivability
    (â€œcheapâ€? offspring)
-   K-selected species have a low growth rate but high survivability
    (â€œexpensiveâ€? offspring)

r-selection

-   Occurs in unstable environments where there are ecological
    disruptions and resources are used for maximising reproduction
-   There are usually many offspring per brood, which require little
    parental care and have a high rate of mortality
-   The body size of offspring is typically small and they have an early
    onset of maturity (short developmental span)
-   Population size is typically variable (highly fluctuating) and an
    example of a r-selected organism is a pioneer species

K-selection

-   Predominates in stable or predictable environments where resources
    are used for maximising long-term survival
-   There are usually very few offspring per brood, each requiring high
    levels of parental care (resulting in low mortality)
-   The body size of offspring is typically larger and they have a late
    onset of maturity (long developmental span)
-   Population size is typically stable (reaches carrying capacity) and
    an example of K-selection is a climax species

It can be difficult to determine if a species is following a r-strategy
or a K-strategy as they represent two ends of an extreme

-   In reality, most organisms typically demonstrate an intermediate
    strategy somewhere along the spectrum (e.g. type II growth)
-   Some species may even change their selection strategy according to
    environmental conditions

Sigmoid Growth Curve

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Phases shown in the sigmoid curve can be explained by rates of
natality, mortality, immigration and emigration

Â  Â Â 
Stable populations occupying a fixed geographic space demonstrate a
sigmoidal (S-shaped) population growth curve

-   This curve will typically follow three key stages â€“ an exponential
    growth phase, a transitional phase and a plateau phase

Exponential Growth Phase

-   Initially, population growth will be slow (lag period) as there are
    few reproductive individuals that are likely widely dispersed
-   As numbers accumulate, there is a rapid increase in population size
    as natality greatly exceeds mortality
-   Mortality is low because there are abundant resources and minimal
    environmental resistance

Transitional Phase

-   As the population continues to grow, resources eventually become
    limited, which leads to competition for survival
-   Natality rates start to fall and mortality rates begin to rise,
    leading to a slowing of population growth

Plateau Phase

-   Eventually the increasing mortality rate equals the natality rate
    and population growth becomes static
-   The population has reached the carrying capacity (Îº) of the
    environment, with limiting factors keeping the population stable
-   The population size at this point will not be constant, but will
    oscillate around the carrying capacity to remain even

Sigmoid Population Growth Curve

[population growth curve]

The stages of the sigmoidal population growth curve can be summarised as
follows:

-   Exponential Growth Phase: Â N + I >>> M + E Â (much greater than)
-   Transitional Phase: Â N + I > M + E Â (greater than)
-   Plateau Phase: Â N + I = M + E Â (equal)

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Modelling the growth curve using a simple organism such as yeast
or a species of Lemna

Â  Â Â 
Population growth curves can be modelled using simple organisms such as
yeast or duckweed (Lemna)

-   These organisms can be grown on agar plates (yeast) or in cups of
    water (duckweed)

There are many benefits to using simple organisms like yeast and
duckweed to model population growth:

-   These organisms are small and so can easily populate small
    containers that are easy to store
-   Nutritional requirements are low, making experiments inexpensive to
    conduct
-   These organisms reproduce very rapidly, allowing results to be
    generated in a relatively short period of time

Yeast and Duckweed

[yeast duckweed]

When grown in controlled conditions, these simple organisms will
demonstrate the phases of a sigmoidal growth curve:

-   After an initial lag period, there will be a period of exponential
    growth whilst resources remain abundant
-   As resources become limited, the growth rate may begin to
    slowÂ before eventually becoming stationary (plateau)
-   Because organisms are being grown in closed systems, an accumulation
    of metabolic waste will inevitably occur
-   This will eventually lead to an increase in the rate of death and an
    overall reduction in population size Â

Sustainable Yields

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Evaluating the methods used to estimate the size of commercial
stock of marine resources

â€¢ Â Analysis of the effect of population size, age and reproductive
status on sustainable fishing practices

Â  Â Â 
In ecology, sustainability is the capacity for a biological system to
remain diverse and productive indefinitely

-   A sustainable yield is the amount of a natural resource that can be
    taken from an ecosystem without reducing the base stock

Maximum Sustainable Yield

In fishing, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the highest
proportion of fish that can be removed from the total population without
jeopardising this maximum yield in the future

-   The MSY will represent the optimum balance between reproductive
    growth rates and losses to harvesting and death
-   The MSY should be half the carrying capacity of the species, as this
    is the stage when population growth will be highest
-   Harvesting above the MSY will soon reduce the possible sizes of
    future yields (not enough base stock to fully resupply)

Estimating Commercial Stock

Calculating the MSY requires the collection of data over many years â€“
this data can be obtained in a number of ways:

-   Commercial stock can be estimated via capture and release methods,
    echo sounders and analysis of fish catches

1. Â Capture-Mark-Release-Recapture

-   Fish populations can be estimated via the Lincoln index using the
    capture-mark-release-recapture method
-   Fish may be captured via electro-shocking (discharging an electric
    pulse into the water to stun nearby fish)
-   This method may be used in rivers and lakes but is not viable in
    oceans (recapture numbers are too low due to fish mobility)

2. Â Echo Sounders

-   Echo sounding involves the transmission of sound waves in water to
    identify the sizes of schools of fish via sonar
-   Echo sounding is a non-invasive way of collecting data, but is only
    useful if the species of fish form shoals

3. Â Analysing Fish Catch Data

-   Data collected from fish catches (e.g. age profile of captured
    stock) can be used to estimate population sizes
-   The accuracy of data relies on cooperation of the fishing community
    â€“ misrepresentation of data will lead to false estimates
-   Because many fish stock occupy international water, effective data
    collection may also require international cooperation
-   If fishing operators do not comply with all regulations, data will
    be biased causing miscalculations of stock size

Example of Fish Catch Data

[fish catch data]

Sustainable Fishing Practices

There are a number of factors that must be considered when developing
and implementing sustainable fishing practices

-   These include considerations of the population size, age and
    reproductive status of the targeted fishing stock

1. Â Population Size

-   The maximum sustainable yield should be half the carrying capacity
    of the species (this is the point of highest growth rate)
-   Harvesting above this threshold (overfishing) will lead to a decline
    in population size over time
-   Limiting total allowable catch sizes and registering the number of
    fishing vessels in use are ways to control population size
-   Certain oceanic regions may also be cordoned off for biological
    conservation (prevent population decline)

2. Â Age

-   If a population is growing, then the relative proportion of younger
    fish will be higher (greater potential for future reproduction)
-   If a population is in decline, then the relative proportion of older
    fish will be higher (higher probable mortality rates)
-   Introducing mesh size restrictions on nets can allow younger fish to
    evade capture (as they are smaller in size)
-   Also, using fish farms instead of open water fishing allows for a
    level of control over the age at which fish are harvested

3. Â Reproductive Status

-   Efforts must be taken to ensure fish are able to reproduce and
    repopulate stock lost to fishing practices
-   If there are insufficient numbers of fish of a suitable reproductive
    age (too young or too old), population numbers will fall
-   Closed seasons are often declared to allow for uninterrupted
    breeding periods via which fish species can repopulate
-   Specific exclusion zones may also be introduced at these times to
    avoid fishing in breeding areas

Eutrophication

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Leaching of mineral nutrients from agricultural land into rivers
causes eutrophication and leads to increased

Â  Â  biochemical oxygen demand

Â  Â Â 
Eutrophication is the enrichment of an ecosystem (typically aquatic)
with chemical nutrients (nitrates, phosphates, etc.)

-   The nutrients can be introduced via leaching from soil by rainfall
    or released as part of sewage
-   Eutrophication is common around agricultural lands where the use
    ofÂ artificial fertilisers are prevalent

An increase in nutrient supply within waterways will result in several
ecological consequences:

-   A rapid growth in algal populations will occur (algal blooms) as a
    result of the increased availability of nutrients
-   As the algae die, there will be a subsequent spike in the numbers of
    saprotrophic microbes (decomposers)
-   The high rate of decomposition will result in an increased
    biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) by saprotrophic bacteria
-   The saprotrophs will consume available quantities of dissolved
    oxygen, leading to deoxygenation of the water supply
-   Eutrophication will also increase the turbidity of the water, which
    will reduce oxygen production by photosynthetic seaweeds
-   This will stress the survival of marine organisms, potentially
    leading to a reduction in biodiversity within the ecosystem

Eutrophication

[eutrophication]
Haber Process

The Haber process is an artificial nitrogen fixation process developed
by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch in 1910

-   It is currently the main industrial procedure for the production of
    ammonia

The Haber process involves the conversion of nitrogen and hydrogen gas
into ammonia using a metal catalyst:

-   Gases are passed over four beds of catalyst at high temperatures and
    high pressures
-   Between each pass the mixture is cooled and any unreacted gases are
    recycled
-   Each pass is only ~15% efficient, however recycling allows for a
    conversion rate of ~97%

The Haber process is used to make nitrogen-based fertilisers which can
be used for agricultural purposes

-   Currently, there is no comparable process for the artificial
    synthesis of phosphate-based fertilisers

C6 Â Nitrogen and Phosphorus Cycles

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Soil cycles are subject to disruption

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia
-   Rhizobium associates with roots in a mutualistic relationship
-   In the absence of oxygen denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate in the
    soil
-   Phosphorus can be added to the phosphorus cycle by application of
    fertilizer or removed by the harvesting of agricultural crops
-   The rate of turnover in the phosphorus cycle is much lower than the
    nitrogen cycle
-   Availability of phosphate may become limiting to agriculture in the
    future
-   Leaching of mineral nutrients from agricultural land into rivers
    causes eutrophication and leads to increased biochemical oxygen
    demand

Applications:

-   The impact of waterlogging on the nitrogen cycle

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing and labelling a diagram of the nitrogen cycle

Â  Â Â 
The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle whereby nitrogen is
converted into various chemical forms

-   Whilst ~78% of the atmosphere is composed of nitrogen (N₂), this gas
    is inert and unable to be used by plants and animals
-   Chemoautrophic bacteria can convert this nitrogen gas into compounds
    that can be assimilated by plants and animals

The Nitrogen Cycle

â‡’Â Â Click on the diagram to show a simplied schematic

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia

â€¢ Â Rhizobium associates with roots in a mutualistic relationship

Â  Â Â 
Nitrogen Fixation

The first stage of the nitrogen cycle is the conversion of inert
nitrogen gas (N₂) intoÂ ammonia (NH₃)

-   This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme nitrogenase, which is
    produced by nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil
-   Azotobacter is found living freely in the soil, while Rhizobium
    forms a mutualistic association with the roots of legumes
-   Rhizobium forms nodules within the plant roots and supplies ammonia
    to the plant in exchange for carbohydrates
-   Ammonia (NH₃) becomes ammonium (NH₄⁺) when mixed with water, and
    this can be used by plants

[nitrogen fixation]

Ammonification

Ammonia can also be produced from organic sources of nitrogen (e.g.
amino acids) when broken down by decomposers

-   As a plant or animal decays, saprotrophs will decompose organic
    materials to produce ammonia (and ammonium ions)
-   This process is known as ammonification and releases ammonium ions
    into the soil which can be absorbed by plantsÂ 

[ammonification]

Nitrification

Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium ions intoÂ nitrites
(NO₂^(â€“))Â andÂ nitrates (NO₃^(â€“))Â by nitrifying bacteria in the
soil

-   Nitrosomonas converts ammonium ions into nitrites, while Nitrobacter
    can convert the nitrites into nitrates
-   These reactions require oxygen and hence soil must be well aerated
    to ensure a rich supply of nitrites and nitrates
-   Nitrites and nitrates are easier for plants to assimilate and hence
    function as a predominant source of nitrogen for plants

[nitrification]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In the absence of oxygen denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate in
the soil

Â  Â Â 
Denitrification

Denitrification is a chemical reduction process that converts nitrates
(NO₃^(â€“)) into nitrogen gas (N₂)

-   It is carried out by denitrifying bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas
    denitrificans) in the absence of oxygen (i.e. anoxic conditions)
-   Nitrates can be used instead of oxygen as an electron acceptor
    during cellular respiration, producing nitrogen gas
-   This will only occur in oxygen-poor conditions (such as waterlogged
    soils) and reduces the availability of nitrates to plants

[denitrification]
Phosphate Availability

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Phosphorus can be added to the phosphorus cycle by application
ofÂ fertiliser or removed by the harvesting of

Â  Â  agricultural crops

Â  Â Â 
Phosphates can be removed from the lithosphere via mining and converted
into phosphate-based fertilisers

-   This allows phosphates that would otherwise remain unaccessible in
    buried rocks to become available for plant use

The fertilisers are then transported to crops in order to increase their
productivity by increasing plant access to phosphate

-   When the crops are harvested, the phosphates that comprise part of
    the plantâ€™s biomass are lost from the phosphorus cycle

While the application of fertiliser adds phosphorus at one site, it
causes the depletion of phosphorus reserves at another site

-   The continued production of phosphate-based fertilisers is depleting
    global phosphorus reserves at a rapid rate

The Role of Fertlisers in the Phosphorus Cycle

[fertiliser]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Availability of phosphate may become limiting to agriculture in
the future

Â  Â Â 
The demand for fertiliser in agriculture is very high, however the rate
of turnover in the phosphorus cycle is very low

-   This means that phosphates are being removed from the lithosphere at
    a much faster rate than they are being replenished
-   Consequently, phosphate minerals are classified as a non-renewable
    resource

Current estimates predict that the availability of phosphates may become
severely restricted within 50 â€“ 100 years

-   This would greatly limit the crop yield per unit of farmland due to
    the reduced use of phosphate-based fertilisers
-   There are currently no synthetic ways of creating phosphate-based
    fertiliser (although this could change in the future)Â

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The rate of turnover in the phosphorus cycle is much lower than
the nitrogen cycle

Â  Â Â 
The phosphorus cycle shows how different forms of phosphorus are
transitioned within the environment

-   Certain rocks contain high levels of phosphate, which can be
    released into the soil and water via chemical weathering
-   Organisms require these phosphates to synthesise nucleic acids,
    membranes (phospholipids) and ATP
-   Phosphates are returned to the soil upon the decomposition of plant
    and animal remains

The phosphorus cycle does not include a gaseous component (i.e. it does
not involve the atmosphere)

-   This means the rate of turnover in the phosphorus cycle is much
    lower than other cycles (it is released slowly by weathering)
-   This also means the rate of replenishment is extremely slow
    (phosphates removed from the soil are not quickly replaced)

Soil Content

List

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Assess the nutrient content of a soil sample

Â  Â Â 
The bulk of soil is made up of a mixture of organic matter, rock and
mineral particles

-   The relative proportion of all these components, along with pH,
    determines soil type (e.g. sand, clay, loam, silt, etc.)

Soil testing kits can be used to identify the amounts of the different
components of soil, including:

-   Nutrients â€“ chemical reagents produce colour changes when testing
    for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or potassium (K)
-   Soil pH â€“ colour changes can be used to identify the acidity or
    alkalinity of a soil sample
-   Texture â€“ soil can be separated into layers according to particle
    size (different particles retain nutrients with varying efficacy
-   Water content â€“ electrical meters can determine water quantities
    based on the soilâ€™s capacity to transmit an electrical current

Gardeners and farmers require this information in order to determine the
viability of the soil for planting purposes

-   Identified issues may require adjustments to the types of crops
    planted or types of fertilisers employed

Sulphur Cycle

The sulphur cycle outlines how different forms of sulphur are cycled
Â within the environment

-   Sulphur is an essential component of living organisms, being a
    constituent part of many proteins and enzyme cofactors
-   Sulphur in the air and soil may be oxidised to form sulphates
    (SO₄^(2â€“))
-   Sulphates are reduced by plants and bacteria and hence sulphur
    becomes incorporated into organic molecules
-   Sulphur within the soil can also be mineralised into inorganic forms
    and incorporated with metals (e.g. ironÂ sulphide)
-   Burning of fossil fuels releases sulphur as sulphur dioxide (SO₂),
    which is an enabling component of acid rain

Application:

â€¢ Â The impact of waterlogging on the nitrogen cycle

Â  Â Â 
Waterlogging occurs when the soil becomes inundated with water, either
through flooding or irrigation with poor drainage

-   Waterlogging impacts the nitrogen cycle by reducing the levels of
    nitrates and nitrites in the soil

Waterlogged soil will lose nitrates and nitrites via the process of
denitrification

-   Waterlogging reduces oxygen availability in the soil, creating
    oxygen-poor conditions favoured by denitrifying bacteria
-   This bacteria (Pseudomonas) will convert available stocks of
    nitrates into nitrogen gas, reducing soil nitrogen content

Waterlogged soil will also lose nitrates and nitrites via the process of
leaching

-   Whenever rainfall exceeds evaporation, there will be a build up of
    water within the porous soil
-   As this water drains downwards through the soil, soluble minerals
    (like nitrates and nitrites) are removed with it
-   Continual leaching impoverishes the upper layers of soil and
    concentrates dissolved minerals in the lower bedrock
-   Leaching is most common in highly porous soils (e.g. sandy soils)
    and least common in textured soils (such as clay)

Application:

â€¢ Â Insectivorous plants as an adaptation for low nitrogen
availability in waterlogged soils

Â  Â Â 
A primary consequence of waterlogging is the reduction in nitrogen
availability within the soil

-   This means that plants are unable to access sufficient quantities of
    nitrogen from the soil via their roots

Insectivorous plants are able to obtain nitrogen in low-nutrient
environments by feeding on invertebrates

-   Insectivorous plants include the Venus fly trap, which is native to
    subtropical wetlands that have waterlogged soil
-   The plantâ€™s terminal leaves form a trapping structure that is
    baited by nectar to attract insects
-   When trapping has occurred, the plant releases digestive enzymes
    that allow it to absorb nutrients from the insect
-   Insectivorous plants only obtain nitrogen from feeding on insects
    â€“ they still derive energy from photosynthesis

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some fatty acids and some amino acids are essential

â€¢ Â Lack of essential amino acids affects the production of proteins

Â  Â Â 
Amino acids are the monomeric building blocks from which proteins are
constructed

-   There areÂ 20Â different amino acids which are universal to all
    living organisms

Amino acids can be either essential, non-essential or conditionally
non-essential according to dietary requirements

-   Essential amino acids cannot be produced by the body and must be
    present in the diet
-   Non-essential amino acids can be produced by the body and are
    therefore not required as part of the diet
-   Conditionally non-essential amino acids can be produced by the body,
    but at rates lower than certain conditional requirements (e.g.
    during pregnancy or infancy) â€“ they are essential at certain times
    only

A shortage of one or more essential amino acids in the diet will prevent
the production of specific proteins

-   This is known as protein deficiency malnutrition and the health
    effects will vary depending on the amino acid shortage

Essential vs Non-Essential Amino Acids

Application:

â€¢ Â Cause and treatment of phenylketonuria

Â  Â Â 
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic condition that results in the
impaired metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine

-   It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation to the
    gene encoding the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase
-   Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) normally converts excess
    phenylalanine within the body into tyrosine
-   In people with PKU, the excess phenylalanine is instead converted
    into phenylpyruvate (also known as phenylketone)
-   This results in a toxic build up of phenylketone in the blood and
    urine (hence phenylketonuria)

Untreated PKU can lead to brain damage and mental retardation, as well
as other serious medical problems

-   Infants with PKU are normal at birth because the mother is able to
    break down phenylalanine during pregnancy
-   Diagnosis of PKU is made by a simple blood test for elevated
    phenylalanine levels shortly after birth

PKU is treated by enforcing a strict diet that restricts the intake of
phenylalanine to prevent its build up within the body

-   This low-protein diet should include certain types of fruits,
    grains, vegetables and special formula milk
-   This diet should be supplemented with a medical formula that
    contains precise quantities of essential amino acids
-   Patients who are diagnosed early and maintain this strict diet can
    have a normal life span without damaging symptoms

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Appetite is controlled by a centre in the hypothalamus

Â  Â Â 
Appetite is controlled by hormones produced in the pancreas, stomach,
intestines and adipose tissue

-   These hormones send messages to the appetite control centre of the
    brain (within the hypothalamus)
-   Hormonal signals will either trigger a feeling of hunger (promote
    feasting) or satiety (promote fasting)

The release of hormones can be triggered in a number of ways:

-   Stretch receptors in the stomach and intestine become activated when
    ingested food distends these organs
-   Adipose tissue releases hormones in response to fat storage
-   The pancreas will release hormones in response to changes in blood
    sugar concentrations

Hormones will either stimulate or inhibit the appetite control centre to
promote sensations of hunger or satiety

-   Hormones that trigger a hunger response include ghrelin (from
    stomach) and glucagon (from pancreas)
-   Hormones that trigger a satiety response include leptin (from
    adipose tissue) and CCK (from intestine)
    -   Hint: Â Ghrelin Grows Hunger ; Leptin Lowers Hunger

Appetite Control

[appetite]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Overweight individuals are more likely to suffer hypertension and
type II diabetes

â€¢ Â Starvation can lead to breakdown of body tissue

Â  Â Â 
Changes in diet and appetite control may result in individuals
over-indulging or under-indulging during meals

-   Individuals who overeat are likely to gain weight and develop
    obesity-related illnesses
-   Individuals who undereat are likely to lose weight and exhibit
    starvation symptoms

Obesity

Clinical obesity (BMI > 30) describes a significant excess in body fat
and is caused by a combination of two factors:

-   Increased energy intake (i.e. overeating or an increased reliance on
    diets rich in fats and sugars)
-   Decreased energy expenditure (i.e. less exercise resulting from an
    increasingly sedentary lifestyle)

Individuals who are overweight or obese are more likely to suffer from
hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure)

-   Excess weight places more strain on the heart to pump blood, leading
    to a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure
-   High cholesterol diets will lead to atherosclerosis, narrowing the
    blood vessels which contributes to raised blood pressure
-   Hypertension is a common precursor to the development of coronary
    heart disease (CHD)

Individuals who are overweight or obese are also more likely to suffer
from type II diabetes (non-insulin dependent)

-   Type II diabetes occurs when fat, liver and muscle cells become
    unresponsive to insulin (insulin insensitivity)
-   This typically results from a diet rich in sugars causing the
    progressive overstimulation of these cells by insulin
-   Hence overweight individuals who have a high sugar intake are more
    likely to develop type II diabetesÂ 

Starvation

Starvation describes the severe restriction of daily energy intake,
leading to a significant loss of weight

-   As the body is not receiving a sufficient energy supply from the
    diet, body tissue is broken down as an energy source
-   This leads to muscle loss (as muscle proteins are metabolised for
    food) and eventually organ damage (and death)

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Breakdown of heart muscle due to anorexia

Â  Â Â 
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder in which individuals severely
limit the amount of food they intake

-   It is most common in young females with body image anxiety and can
    potentially be fatal if left untreated

In severe anorexia, the body begins to break down heart muscle, making
heart disease the most common cause of death

-   Blood flow is reduced and blood pressure may drop as heart tissue
    begins to starve
-   The heart may also develop dangerous arrhythmias and become
    physically diminished in size

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of databases of nutritional content of foods to calculate
intakes of essential nutrients from a daily diet

Â  Â Â 
The recommended daily intake for a nutrient (RDI) is the daily dietary
level required to meet the requirements of health

-   It is an estimate only and will vary according to age, gender,
    activity levels and medical conditions

The recommendations are based on a daily energy intake of 8400 kJ (2000
kcal) for healthy adults

-   On food packages, this information is usually presented as a
    percentage of a daily total (based on identified serving size)

Recommended Daily Intake (RDI)

[dietary intake]

Dietary intake can be recorded and compared against levels of energy
expenditure in order to monitor weight change

-   There are a variety of online databases and software programs that
    can be used to calculate dietary intake and expenditure

A free online database and nutritional calculator can be accessed by

Dietary Supplements

Artificial supplementation ensures a population has sufficient access to
essential nutrients

-   Supplements may be added to natural dietary sources or taken
    independently with meals (e.g. vitamin tablets)
-   The cost to supplement dietary products is minimal compared to the
    cost of treating deficiency diseases

Examples of dietary supplementation include:

-   Production of iodised salt to prevent iodine deficiencies like
    goitre (iodine is important for thyroxine production)
-   Fluoridation of water supplies to protect teeth against decay
    (fluorine is important in tooth development)

Energy Sources

List

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Determination of the energy content of food by combustion

Â  Â 
Determining Energy Content

The energy content of food can be estimated by burning a sample of known
mass and measuring the energy released via calorimetry

-   Combustion of the food source causes the stored energy to be
    released as heat, which raises the temperature of water
-   The amount of energy required to raise 1 g of water by 1ÂºC is 4.18
    J â€“ this is the specific heat capacity of water

The equation for calculating the energy content of a food source via
calorimetry is as follows:

-   Energy (joules) = Mass of water (g)Â Ã— 4.2 (J/gÂºC)Â Ã— Temperature
    increase (ÂºC)

The biggest source of error in calorimetry is usually caused by the
unwanted loss of heat to the surrounding environment

-   The food sources should be burnt at a constant distance from the
    water to ensure reliability of results
-   The initial temperature and volume of water should also be kept
    constant (1 g of water = 1 cm³ or 1 ml)

Measuring Energy Content of Food via Calorimetry

[My Image 1] [My Image 2]

Comparing Energy Content

The three types of nutrients that are commonly used as energy sources
areÂ carbohydrates, lipids (fats) and proteins

-   Carbohydrates are preferentially used as an energy source because
    they are easier to digest and transport
-   Lipids can store more energy per gram but are harder to digest and
    transport (hence are used for long-term storage)
-   Protein metabolism produces nitrogenous waste products which must be
    removed from cells

The relative energy content of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are as
follows:

-   Carbohydrates â€“ 1,760 kJ per 100 grams
-   Proteins â€“ 1,720 kJ per 100 grams
-   Fats â€“ 4,000 kJ per 100 grams

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Essential nutrients cannot be synthesised by the body, therefore
they have to be included in the diet

Â  Â Â 
A nutrient is a chemical substance found in foods that is used in the
human body

-   There are six classes of nutrients â€“ carbohydrates, proteins,
    lipids, vitamins, minerals and water

Essential nutrients are those that cannot be synthesised by the body and
must be ingested as part of the diet

-   Non-essential nutrients can be made by the body or have a
    replacement nutrient which serves the same dietary purpose
-   Carbohydrates are not considered essential nutrients as human diets
    can obtain energy from other sources without ill effect

Types of Nutrients

[nutrients]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Malnutrition may be caused by a deficiency, imbalance or excess of
nutrients in the diet

Â  Â Â 
Malnutrition is a health condition caused by a deficiency, imbalance or
excess of nutrients in the diet

-   It can be caused by an improper dietary intake of nutrients â€“ e.g.
    overnutrition (too much) or undernutrition (not enough)
-   It can be caused by the inadequate utilisation of nutrients by the
    body â€“ e.g. due to illness or disease

The symptoms of malnutrition will vary according to the specific
nutrient and the type of imbalance involved

-   Common signs of malnutrition included stunted growth and wasting
    (undernutrition), as well as obesity (over nutrition)

Different Forms of Malnutrition

Food Pyramids

A food pyramid is a triangular diagram that represents the recommended
number of servings to be eaten each day from each of the basic food
groups

-   Food pyramids have in the past been changed or updated in order to
    reflect current nutritional research
-   Many nutritional experts contest the optimal dietary values, making
    food pyramids a useful, but imprecise, guide

-   Essential nutrients cannot be synthesised by the body, therefore
    they have to be included in the diet
-   Dietary minerals are essential chemical elements
-   Vitamins are chemically diverse carbon compounds that cannot be

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some fatty acids and some amino acids are essential

Â  Â Â 
Humans can synthesise most fatty acids from carbohydrates, but two
(cis)-polyunsaturatedÂ fatty acids are considered essential

-   Alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an
    omega-6 fatty acid) cannot be synthesised by the body
-   This is because humans lack the enzyme required to introduce double
    bonds at the required position of the carbon chain

Essential fatty acids are modified by the body to make important
lipid-based compounds (such as signalling molecules)

-   There is evidence to suggest dietary deficiencies of these fatty
    acids may be linked to impaired brain development (e.g. depression)
    and altered maintenance of cardiac tissue (e.g. abnormal heart
    function) â€“ although this evidence is contested

Foods rich in essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) include fish,
leafy vegetables and walnuts

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Cholesterol in blood as an indicator of the risk of coronary heart
disease

Â  Â Â 
Fats and cholesterol cannot dissolve in the bloodstream and so are
packaged with proteins (to form lipoproteins) for transport

-   Low density lipoproteins (LDLs) carry cholesterol from the liver to
    the body (hence raise blood cholesterol levels)
-   High density lipoproteins (HDLs) carry excess cholesterol back to
    the liver for disposal (hence lower blood cholesterol levels)

The mix of fatty acids consumed as part of a diet directly influences
the levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream:

-   Saturated fats increase LDL levels within the body, raising blood
    cholesterol levelsÂ 
-   TransÂ fats increase LDL levels and lower HDL levels, significantly
    raising blood cholesterol levels
-   Cis-polyunsaturated fats raise HDL levels, lowering blood
    cholesterol levels

High cholesterol levels in the bloodstream lead to the hardening and
narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis)

-   When there are high levels of LDL in the bloodstream, the LDL
    particles will form deposits in the walls of the arteries
-   The accumulation of fat within the arterial wall leads to the
    development of plaques which restrict blood flow
-   If coronary arteries become blocked, coronary heart disease (CHD)
    will result â€“ this includes heart attacks and strokes

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Dietary minerals are essential chemical elements

Â  Â Â 
Dietary minerals are chemical elements required as essential nutrients
by organisms

-   Minerals present in common organic molecules are not considered
    essential â€“ e.g. C, H, O, N, S
-   Minerals include calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), phosphorus
    (P), sodium (Na), potassium (K) and chlorine (Cl)

Minerals in Human Development

Some of the important functions played by minerals are listed below:

-   Major constituents of structures such as teeth and bones (e.g. Ca,
    P, Mg)
-   Important components of body fluids (e.g. Na, K, Cl)
-   Cofactors for specific enzymes or components of proteins and
    hormones (e.g. Fe, P, I)

A deficiency in one or more dietary mineral can result in a disorder
(e.g. lack of calcium can affect bone mineralisation)

Summary of Dietary Minerals

Minerals in Plant Development

Minerals are also important in plant development, making fruits and
vegetables a good source of certain dietary minerals

-   Magnesium is an important component of chlorophyll (required for
    photosynthesis)
-   Potassium is an inorganic salt found within the sap of a plant
    (maintains water potential)
-   Calcium is important for plant root and shoot elongation

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Vitamins are chemically diverse carbon compounds that cannot be
synthesised by the body

Â  Â Â 
Vitamins are organic molecules with complex chemical structures that are
quite diverse and hence categorised by groups

-   Water soluble vitamins need to be constantly consumed as any excess
    is lost in urine (e.g. vitamins B, C)
-   Fat soluble vitamins can be stored within the body (e.g. vitamins A,
    D, E, K)

The functions of vitamins are as diverse as their structure, although
many function as cofactors, antioxidants or hormones

-   Many vitamins are essential as they cannot be synthesised by the
    body and their absence may cause a deficiency disease

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Production of ascorbic acid by some mammals, but not others that
need a dietary supply

Â  Â Â 
Ascorbic acid is a form of vitamin C that is required for a range of
metabolic activities in all animals and plants

-   In mammals it functions as a potent antioxidant and also plays an
    important role in immune function
-   It is also involved in the synthesis of collagen (a structural
    protein) and in the synthesis of lipoproteins

Ascorbic acid is made internally by most mammals from monosaccharides
â€“ but it is not produced by humans

-   Consequently, human must ingest vitamin C as part of their dietary
    requirements in order to avoid adverse health effects

A deficiency in vitamin C levels will lead to the development of scurvy
and a general weakening of normal immune function

-   Common food sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits and orange
    juice

Common Symptoms of Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy)

[scurvy]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Lack of Vitamin D or calcium can affect bone mineralisation and
cause rickets or osteomalacia

Â  Â Â 
Vitamin D is involved in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the
body â€“ which contribute to bone mineralisation

-   In the absence of sufficient amounts of this vitamin, these elements
    are not absorbed but instead excreted in the faeces
-   This can lead to the onset of diseases such as osteomalacia (where
    bones soften) or rickets (where bones are deformed)

Vitamin D can be naturally synthesised by the body when a chemical
precursor is exposed to UV light (i.e. sunlight)

-   The vitamin D may be stored by the liver for when levels are low
    (e.g. during winter when sun exposure is reduced)
-   Individuals with darker skin pigmentation produce vitamin D more
    slowly and hence require greater sun exposure

Vitamin D deficiencies are usually restricted to individuals with highly
limited sun exposure (e.g. elderly, certain ethnicities)

-   While excess sun exposure is beneficial for vitamin D production, it
    also increases the risks of developing skin cancers

Common Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency (Rickets)

Dietary Fibre

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The rate of transit of materials through the large intestine is
positively correlated with their fibre content

â€¢ Â Materials not absorbed are egested

Â  Â Â 
The human intestines function to complete the process of digestion and
absorb digested products into the bloodstream

-   The small intestine absorbs usable food substances (i.e. nutrients
    â€“ monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, etc.)
-   The large intestine absorbs water and dissolved minerals (i.e. ions)
    from the indigestible food residues

Dietary Fibre

Dietary fibre, or roughage, is the indigestible portion of food derived
principally from plants and fungi (cellulose, chitin, etc.)

-   Humans lack the necessary enzymes to break down certain plant matter
    (e.g. lack cellulase required to digest cellulose)
-   Certain herbivores (ruminants) possess helpful bacteria in the
    digestive tract that canÂ break down indigestible plant matter

The rate of transit of materials through the large intestine is
positively correlated with their fibre content:

-   Roughage provides bulk in the intestines to help keep materials
    moving through the gut
-   Roughage also absorbs water, which keeps bowel movements soft and
    easy to pass

There are several health benefits associated with diets rich in dietary
fibre:

-   It reduces the frequency of constipation and lowers the risk of
    colon and rectal cancer
-   It lowers blood cholesterol and regulates blood sugar levels (by
    slowing the rate of absorption)
-   It aids in weight management (contributes few calories despite
    consisting of a large volume of ingested material)

Egestion

Materials that are not absorbed by the small and large intestines are
ultimately egested from the body as faeces

-   A large portion of human faeces consists of dietary fibre, such
    asÂ cellulose and lignin
-   Also present in faeces are the remains of intestinal epithelial
    cells, bile pigments and human flora (intestinal bacteria)

[belch]

Application:

â€¢ Â Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of stomach ulcers

Â  Â Â 
Stomach ulcers are inflammed and damaged areas in the stomach wall,
typically caused by exposure to gastric acids

-   There is a strong positive correlation between Helicobacter pylori
    infection and the development of stomach ulcers

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that can survive the acid conditions
of the stomach by penetrating the mucus lining

-   H. pylori anchors to the epithelial lining of the stomach,
    underneath the mucus lining
-   An inflammatory immune response damages the epithelial cells of the
    stomach â€“ including the mucus-secreting goblet cells
-   This results in the degradation of the protective mucus lining,
    exposing the stomach wall to gastric acids and causing ulcers
-   The prolonged presence of stomach ulcers may lead to the development
    of stomach cancer over many years (20 â€“ 30 years)
-   Â H. pylori infectionsÂ can be treated by antibiotics (previously,
    stomach ulcers were considered stress related and not treatable)

Stomach Ulcer Formation

[stomach ulcers]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Dehydration due to cholera toxin

Â  Â Â 
Vibrio cholerae is a bacterial pathogen that infects the intestines and
causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration

-   The associated disease â€“ cholera â€“ can kill within hours unless
    treated with oral rehydration therapies

V.Â cholerae releases a toxin that binds to ganglioside receptors on the
surface of intestinal epithelium cells

-   This toxin is internalised by endocytosis and triggers the
    production of cyclic AMP (a second messenger) within the cell
-   Cyclic AMP (cAMP) activates specific ion channels within the cell
    membrane, causing an efflux of ions from the cell
-   The build up of ions in the intestinal lumen draws water from cells
    and tissues via osmosis â€“ causing acute diarrhoea
-   As water is being removed from body tissues, dehydration will result
    if left untreated

Mechanism of Action of Cholera Toxin

[cholera]
Digestive Juices

The digestive system contains numerous organs that contribute to the
secretion of digestive juices

-   These organs include the salivary glands, stomach, liver, pancreas
    and small intestine

Organs Involved in Digestive Juice Production

[digestive juice organs]

Salivary Glands

-   Initiate chemical digestion while food is still being physically
    chewed within the mouth
-   SecretesÂ salivary amylase, which assists in the breakdown of
    glucose polymers (e.g. starch)

Stomach

-   Produces stomach acids which aid in the chemical breakdown of food
    materials
-   Secretes proteases to function as the initial site of protein
    digestion
-   Stomach proteases typically require acid conditions for activation
    (e.g. pepsinogenÂ â†’Â pepsin)

Liver

-   Produces bile which is responsible for the emulsification of fats
    (separates fats globules to enhance lipase activity)
-   Bile produced in the liver is commonly stored in the gall bladder
    until release

Pancreas

-   Secretes bicarbonate ions into the duodenum to neutralise stomach
    acids (intestine pH is usually ~ 7 â€“ 8)
-   Also secretes lipase (for fat digestion), amylase (for carbohydrate
    digestion) and protease (for protein digestion)
-   Pancreatic proteases are activated by enzymes and not by acid
    conditions (enterokinase converts trypsinogen to trypsin)

Small Intestine

-   Intestinal juices are secreted from pits called crypts
    ofÂ Leiberkuhn, located between intestinal villiÂ 
-   Digestive enzymes in the small intestine are typically immobilised
    on the epithelial membrane (e.g. maltase)
-   This prevents the enzymes from being removed from the body as part
    of the normal digestive cycle
-   It also concentrates the digestive products at sites where membrane
    proteins are present (to optimise absorption)
Exocrine Glands

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Exocrine glands secrete to the surface of the body or the lumen of
the gut

Â  Â Â 
Exocrine glands produce and secrete substances via a ductÂ onto an
epithelial surface â€“ either:

-   The surface of the body (e.g. sweat glands, sebaceous glands)
-   The lumen of the digestive tract / gut (e.g. digestive glands)

Examples of digestive glands include:

-   Salivary glands â€“ secrete saliva which contains amylase (breaks
    down starch)
-   Gastric glands â€“ secretes gastric juices which includes
    hydrochloric acid and proteases (breaks down protein)
-   Pancreatic glands â€“ secretes pancreatic juices which include
    lipase, protease and amylase
-   Intestinal glands â€“ secretes intestinal juices via crypts of
    Lieberkuhn in the intestinal wall

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of exocrine gland cells that secrete digestive
juices from electron micrographs

Â  Â Â 
Exocrine glands are composed of a cluster of secretory cells which
collectively form an acinus (plural = acini)

-   The acini are surrounded by a basement membrane and are held
    together by tight junctions between secretory cells
-   The secretory cells possess a highly developed ER and golgi network
    for material secretion and are rich in mitochondria

Exocrine products are released (via secretory vesicles) into a duct,
which connects to an epithelial surface

-   These ducts may arise from a convergence of smaller ductules (each
    connected to an acinus) in order to enhance secretion

Gastric Pits

The stomach wall is lined with millions of gastric pits which release
gastric juice into the stomach lumen

-   Gastric juice is an acidic solution that functions to break down
    food into a creamy paste called chyme

The gastric pits are lined by a number of different cell types which
contribute to the overall function of the stomach:

-   Goblet cells â€“ secrete mucus to form a protective layer around the
    stomach lining
-   Parietal cells â€“ secrete hydrochloric acid which is responsible
    for creating a low pH environment in the stomach
-   G cells â€“ secrete gastrin (stimulates release of stomach acids to
    increase stomach acidity)
-   D cells â€“ secrete somatostatin (inhibits release of stomach acids
    to reduce stomach acidity)
-   Chief cells â€“ secrete pepsinogen (inactive protease precursor
    which is activated by acidity to form active pepsin)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nervous and hormonal mechanisms control the secretion of digestive
juices

â€¢ Â The volume and content of gastric secretions are controlled by
nervous and hormonal mechanisms

Â  Â Â 
The secretion of digestive juices is controlled by both nervous and
hormonal mechanisms

-   These mechanisms control both the volume of secretions produced and
    the specific content (e.g. enzymes, acids, etc.)

Nervous Mechanism:

-   The sight and smell of food triggers an immediateÂ response by which
    gastric juice is secreted by the stomach pre-ingestion
-   When food enters the stomach it causes distension, which is detected
    by stretch receptors in the stomach lining
-   Signals are sent to the brain, which triggers the release of
    digestive hormones to achieve sustained gastric stimulation

Hormonal Mechanism:

-   Gastrin is secreted into the bloodstream from the gastric pits of
    the stomach and stimulates the release of stomach acids
-   If stomach pH drops too low (becomes too acidic), gastrin secretion
    is inhibited by gut hormones (secretin and somatostatin)
-   When digested food (chyme) passes into the small intestine, the
    duodenum also releases digestive hormones:
    -   Secretin andÂ cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulate the pancreas and
        liver to release digestive juices
    -   Pancreatic juices contain bicarbonate ions which neutralise
        stomach acids, while the liver produces bile to emulsify fats

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The structure of cells of the epithelium of the villi is adapted
to the absorption of food

Â  Â Â 
Once digested food has passed through the stomach, it enters the small
intestine for absorption into the blood

-   The small intestine also releases digestive enzymes to ensure the
    complete hydrolysis of food molecules

The inner epithelial lining of the small intestine is highly folded into
finger-like projections called villi (singular: villus)

-   Many villi will protrude into the intestinal lumen, greatly
    increasing the available surface area for material absorption

Features of Villi

Intestinal villi contain several structural features which facilitate
the absorption of digestive products:
[Mr Slim]

-   MicrovilliÂ â€“ Ruffling of epithelial membrane further increases
    surface area
-   Rich blood supplyÂ â€“ Dense capillary network rapidly transports
    absorbed products
-   Single layer epitheliumÂ â€“ Minimises diffusion distance between
    lumen and blood
-   LactealsÂ â€“ Absorbs lipids from the intestine into the lymphatic
    system
-   Intestinal glandsÂ â€“ Exocrine pits (crypts of Lieberkuhn) release
    digestive juices
-   Membrane proteinsÂ â€“ Facilitates transport of digested materials
    into epithelial cells

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of villus epithelium cells that absorb digested
food from electron micrographs

Â  Â Â 

The epithelial lining of villi contains several structural features
which optimise its capacity to absorb digested materials:
Tight Junctions

-   Occluding associations between the plasma membrane of two adjacent
    cells, creating an impermeable barrier
-   They keep digestive fluids separated from tissues and maintain a
    concentration gradient by ensuring one-way movementÂ 

Microvilli

-   Microvilli borders significantly increase surface area of the plasma
    membrane (>100Ã—), allowing for more absorption to occur
-   The membrane will be embedded with immobilised digestive enzymes and
    channel proteins to assist in material uptakeÂ 

Mitochondria

-   Epithelial cells of intestinal villi will possess large numbers of
    mitochondria to provide ATP for active transport mechanisms
-   ATP may be required for primary active transport (against gradient),
    secondary active transport (co-transport) or pinocytosis

Pinocytotic Vesicles

-   Pinocytosis (â€˜cell-drinkingâ€™) is the non-specific uptake of
    fluids and dissolved solutes (a quick way to translocate in bulk)
-   These materials will be ingested via the breaking and reforming of
    the membrane and hence contained within a vesicle

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Acid conditions in the stomach favor some hydrolysis reactions and
help to control pathogens in ingested food

Â  Â Â 
The gastric glands that line the stomach wall secrete an acidic solution
that creates a low pH environment within the stomach

-   The normal pH of the stomach is roughly 1.5 â€“ 2.0, which is the
    optimum pH for hydrolysis reactions by stomach enzymes

The acid conditions in the stomach serve a number of functions:

-   Assists in the digestion of food (by dissolving chemical bonds
    within food molecules)
-   Activates stomach proteases (e.g. pepsin is activated when
    pepsinogen is proteolytically cleaved in acid conditions)
-   Prevents pathogenic infection (stomach acids destroy microorganisms
    in ingested food)

The stomach wall is lined by a layer of mucus, which protects the
stomach lining from being damaged by the acid conditions

-   The pancreas releases bicarbonate ions into the duodenum which
    neutralises the stomach pH (intestinal pH ~7.0 â€“ 8.0)
-   Certain foods (e.g. antacids) may also neutralise stomach acids,
    impairing digestion and increasing chances of infection

Application:

â€¢ Â The reduction of stomach acid secretion by proton pump inhibitor
drugs

Â  Â Â 
The low pH environment of the stomach is maintained by proton pumps in
the parietal cells of the gastric pits

-   These proton pumps secrete H⁺ ions (via active transport), which
    combine with Cl^(â€“) ions to form hydrochloric acid
-   Certain medications and disease conditions can increase the
    secretion of H⁺ ions, lowering the pH in the stomach

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs which irreversibly bind to the
proton pumps and prevent H⁺ ion secretion

-   This effectively raises the pH in the stomach to prevent gastric
    discomfort caused by high acidity (e.g. acid reflux)
-   Individuals taking PPIs may have increased susceptibility to gastric
    infections due to the reduction of acid secretion

Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)

[PPIs]
Deamination

The breakdown of amino acids releases nitrogen-containing amine groups
(NH₂) which can be toxic to cells

-   The liver removes these amine groups via the process of deamination
    and converts them into harmless products

The amine group is first converted into ammonia (which is toxic) and
then converted into urea

-   Urea is non-toxic and excreted from the body by the kidneys (it is a
    component of urine)

The amine group can also be transferred via transamination to make new
amino acids

-   These amino acids are non-essential â€“ as they can be synthesised
    by the body

The remaining carbon skeleton is recycled to produce compounds that can
be oxidised for energy

-   This includes the formation of glucose, ketone bodies and acetyl CoA

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The liver removes toxins from the blood and detoxifies them

Â  Â Â 
The liver acts on drugs and toxins that have entered the bloodstreamÂ 

-   Many of these toxic compounds are fat soluble, making them difficult
    for the body to excrete
-   These compounds are converted into less harmful and more soluble
    forms, which are then excreted from the body

The detoxification of compounds by the liver typically involves two sets
of chemical pathways:

1.  Toxins are converted into less harmful chemicals by oxidation,
    reduction and hydrolysis reactions
    -   These reactions are mediated by a group of enzymes known as the
        cytochrome P450 enzyme group
    -   These conversions produce damaging free radicals, which are
        neutralised by antioxidants within the liver
2.  The converted chemical is then attached to another substance (e.g.
    cysteine) via a conjugation reaction
    -   This renders the compound even less harmful and also functions
        to make it water soluble
    -   The water soluble compounds can now be excreted from the body
        within urine by the kidneys

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Components of red blood cells are recycled by the liver

Â  Â Â 
In humans, red blood cells possess minimal organelles and no nucleus in
order to carry moreÂ haemoglobin

-   Consequently, red blood cells have a short lifespan (~120 days) and
    must be constantly replaced

The liver is responsible for the break down of red blood cells and
recycling of its components

-   These components are used to make either new red blood cells or
    other important compounds (e.g. bile)

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The breakdown of erythrocytes starts with phagocytosis of red
blood cells by Kupffer cells

â€¢ Â Iron is carried to the bone marrow to produce haemoglobin in new
red blood cells

Â  Â Â 
Kupffer cells are specialised phagocytes within the liver which engulf
red blood cells and break them down

-   Kupffer cells break down haemoglobin into globin and iron-containing
    heme groups
-   Globin is digested by peptidases to produce amino acids (which are
    either recycled or metabolised by the liver)
-   Heme groups are broken down into iron and bilirubin (bile pigment)

The released iron must be complexed within a protein in order to avoid
oxidation to a ferric state

-   Iron can be stored by the liver within a protein shell of ferritin
-   Iron can be transported to the bone marrow (where new haemoglobin is
    produced) within the protein transferrin

Jaundice

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of jaundice

Â  Â Â 
Jaundice is a condition caused by an excess of bile pigment â€“
bilirubin â€“ within the body

-   Bilirubin is produced as part of the natural breakdown of
    haemoglobin by the liver
-   Normally, the liver conjugates this bilirubin to other chemicals and
    then secretes it in bile
-   When there is an excess of bilirubin, it may leak out into
    surrounding tissue fluids

Jaundice may be caused by any condition which impairs the natural
breakdown of red blood cells, including:

-   Liver disease â€“ impaired removal of bilirubin by the liver may
    cause levels to build within the body
-   Obstruction of the gall bladder â€“ preventing the secretion of bile
    will cause bilirubin levels to accumulate
-   Damage to red blood cells â€“ increased destruction of erythrocytes
    (e.g. anemia) will cause bilirubin levels to rise

The main consequence of jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the
skin and whites of the eyes (sclera)

-   Other common symptoms include itchiness, paler than usual stools and
    darkened urine

Jaundice may be resolved by treating the underlying cause for the build
up of bilirubin within the body

Common Symptoms of Jaundice

[jaundice]
Liver and Alcohol

Alcohol is metabolised by the liver to form products that may be toxic
to the hepatocytes

-   Alcohol consumption also reduces cellular antioxidant activity,
    reducing the liverâ€™s capacity for detoxification

Over time, healthy liver cells are replaced by damaged cells, which
reduces the livers ability to:

-   Metabolise the bodyâ€™s supply of carbohydrates, fats and proteins
-   Produce bile and recycle red blood cells
-   Transport materials around the body (blood flow becomes blocked to
    and from the liver)

Long term alcohol abuse will result in three primary effects upon the
liver:

-   Inflammation â€“ swelling of damaged liver tissue causes the liver
    to become enlarged
-   Fat accumulation â€“ there is a build up of fatty deposits in place
    of normal tissue, blocking blood flow
-   Cirrhosis â€“ Scar tissue is created by the deposition of collagen
    where tissue is damagedÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The liver intercepts blood from the gut to regulate nutrient
levels

Â  Â Â 
The liver is a lobed organ located below the diaphragm that functions to
regulate the chemical composition of blood

-   It receives oxygenated blood via the hepatic artery, which is used
    to sustain liver cells (hepatocytes)
-   It also receives nutrient rich blood from the gut via the portal
    vein
-   Deoxygenated blood is transported from the liver via the hepatic
    vein

The liver functions to process the nutrients absorbed from the gut and
hence regulates the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes

-   It is responsible for the storage and controlled release of key
    nutrients (e.g. glycogen, cholesterol, triglycerides)
-   It is responsible for the detoxification of potentially harmful
    ingested substances (e.g. amino acids, medications, alcohol)
-   It produces plasma proteins that function to maintain sustainable
    osmotic conditions within the bloodstream
-   It is responsible for the breakdown of red blood cells and the
    production of bile salts

Application:

â€¢ Â Dual blood supply to the liver and differences between sinusoids
and capillaries

Â  Â Â 
Hepatic Lobules

The liver is composed of smaller histological structures called lobules,
which are roughly hexagonal in shape

-   Each lobule is surrounded by branches of the hepatic artery (provide
    oxygen) and the portal vein (provide nutrients)
-   These vessels drain into capillary-like structures called sinusoids,
    which exchange materials directly with the hepatocytes
-   The sinusoids drain into a central vein, which feeds deoxygenated
    blood into the hepatic vein
-   Hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported by vessels
    called canaliculi to bile ducts, which surround the lobule

Structural Organisation of the Liver

[liver lobule]

Sinusoids

Sinusoids are a type of small blood vessel found in the liver that
perform a similar function to capillaries (material exchange)

-   Sinusoids have increased permeability, allowing larger molecules
    (e.g. plasma proteins) to enter and leave the bloodstreamÂ 

The increased permeability of sinusoids is important for liver function
and is due to a number of structural features:

-   The surrounding diaphragm (basement membrane) is incomplete or
    discontinuous in sinusoids (but not in capillaries)
-   The endothelial layer contains large intercellular gaps and fewer
    tight junctions (allowing for the passage of larger molecules)

Nutrient Supply

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some nutrients in excess can be stored in the liver

â€¢ Â Surplus cholesterol is converted into bile salts

Â  Â Â 
The liver plays an important role in regulating the levels of nutrients
in the bloodstream

-   Nutrients absorbed by the small intestine are transported by the
    hepatic portal vein to the liver for metabolism
-   The liver converts these nutrients into forms that can be stored or
    used and mediates their transport to various tissues
-   Nutrients stored within the liver include glycogen, iron, vitamin A
    and vitamin D

Carbohydrate Metabolism

-   Excess glucose in the bloodstream (e.g. after meals) is taken up by
    the liver and stored as glycogenÂ 
-   When blood glucose levels drop, the liver breaks down glycogen into
    glucose and exports it to body tissues
-   When hepatic glycogen reserves become exhausted, the liver
    synthesises glucose from other sources (e.g. fats)
-   These metabolic processes are coordinated by the pancreatic hormones
    â€“ insulin and glucagon

Protein Metabolism

-   The body can not store amino acids, meaning they must be broken down
    when in excess
-   Amino acid breakdown releases an amine group (NH₂), which cannot be
    used by the body and is potentially toxic
-   The liver is responsible for the removal of the amine group
    (deamination) and its conversion into a harmless product
-   The amine group is converted into urea by the liver, which is
    excreted within urine by the kidneys
-   The liver can also synthesise non-essential amino acids from surplus
    stock (viaÂ transamination)

Fat Metabolism

-   The liver is the major site for converting excess carbohydrates and
    proteins into fatty acids and triglycerides
-   It is alsoÂ responsible for the synthesis of large quantities of
    phospholipids and cholesterolÂ 
-   These compounds are then stored by the liver or exported to cells by
    different types of lipoproteins
-   Low density lipoprotein (LDL) transports cholesterol to cells, for
    use in the cell membrane and in steroid synthesis
-   High density lipoprotein (HDL) transports excess cholesterol from
    cells back to the liver (for storage or conversion)
-   LDL is consideredÂ â€˜badâ€™Â as it raises blood cholesterol levels,
    while HDL lowers cholesterol levels and is therefore â€˜goodâ€™
-   Surplus cholesterol is converted by the liver into bile salts, which
    can be eliminated from the body via the bowels

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in hepatocytes produce

Â  Â Â 
Plasma proteins are proteins present in the blood plasma and are
produced by the liver (except for immunoglobulins)

-   The proteins are produced by the rough ER in hepatocytes and
    exported into the blood via the Golgi complex

There are a number of different types of plasma proteins, each serving
different specific functions:

-   Albumins regulate the osmotic pressure of the blood (and hence
    moderate the osmotic pressure of body fluids)
-   Globulins participate in the immune system (i.e. immunoglobulins)
    and also act as transport proteins
-   Fibrinogens are involved in the clotting process (soluble fibrinogen
    can form an insoluble fibrin clot)
-   Low levels of other plasma proteins have various functions
    (e.g.Â Î±-1-antitrypsin neutralises digestiveÂ trypsin)

Cardiac Conduction

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Signals from the sinoatrial node that cause contraction cannot
pass directly from atria to ventricles

â€¢ Â There is a delay between the arrival and passing on of a stimulus
at the atrioventricular node

Â  Â Â 
Cardiac muscle cells are not fused together but are instead connected
via gap junctions at intercalated discs

-   This means that while electrical signals can pass between cells,
    each cell is capable of independent contraction
-   The coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle cells is controlled by
    specialised autorhythmic cells (â€˜pace makersâ€™)

Atrial Contraction

Within the wall of the right atrium is a specialised cluster of
cardiomyocytes which directs the contraction of heart tissue

-   This cluster of cells is collectively called the sinoatrial node (SA
    node or SAN)
-   The sinoatrial node acts as a primary pacemaker, controlling the
    rate at which the heart beats (i.e. pace 'makingâ€™)
-   It sends out electrical signals which are propagated throughout the
    entire atria via gap junctions in the intercalated discs
-   In response, the cardiac muscle within the atrial walls contract
    simultaneously (atrial systole)

The atria and ventricles of the heart are separated by a fibrous cardiac
skeleton composed of connective tissue

-   This connective tissue functions to anchor the heart valves in place
    and cannot conduct electrical signals
-   The signals from the sinoatrial node must instead be relayed through
    a second node located within this cardiac skeleton
-   This second node is called the atrioventricular node (or AV node)
    and separates atrial and ventricular contractions
-   The AV node propagates electrical signals more slowly than the SA
    node, creating a delay in the passing on of the signal

Overview of Atrial Contraction / Systole

[atrial systole]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â This delay allows time for atrial systole before the
atrioventricular valves close

â€¢ Â Conducting fibres ensure coordinated contraction of the entire
ventricular wall

Â  Â Â 
The separation of atrial and ventricular contraction is important as it
optimises the flow of blood between the heart chambers

-   The delay in time following atrial systole allows for blood to fill
    the ventricles before the atrioventricular valves close

Ventricular Contraction

Ventricular contraction occurs following excitation of the
atrioventricular node (located at the atrial and ventricular junction)

-   The AV node sends signals down the septum via a specialised bundle
    of cardiomyocytes called the Bundle of His
-   The Bundle of His innervates Purkinje fibres in the ventricular
    wall, which causes the cardiac muscle to contract
-   This sequence of events ensures contractions begin at the apex
    (bottom), forcing blood up towards the arteries

Overview of Ventricular Contraction / Systole

[ventricular systole]

Heart Relaxation / Diastole

After everyÂ contraction of the heart, there is a period of
insensitivity to stimulation (i.e. a refractory period)

-   This recovery period (diastole) is relatively long, and allows the
    heart to passively refill with blood between beats
-   This long recovery period also helps prevent heart tissue becoming
    fatigued, allowing contractions to continue for life

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Structure of cardiac muscle cells allows propagation of stimuli
through the heart wall

Â  Â Â 
The heart is composed of cardiac muscle cells which have specialised
features that relates to their function:

-   Cardiac muscle cells contract without stimulation by the central
    nervous system (contraction is myogenic)
-   Cardiac muscle cells are branched, allowing for faster signal
    propagation and contraction in three dimensions
-   Cardiac muscles cells are not fused together, but are connected by
    gap junctions at intercalated discs
-   Cardiac muscle cells have more mitochondria, as they are more
    reliant on aerobic respiration than skeletalÂ muscle

These structural features contribute to the unique functional properties
of the cardiac tissue:

-   Cardiac muscle has a longer period of contraction and refraction,
    which is needed to maintain a viable heart beat
-   The heart tissue does not become fatigued (unlike skeletal muscle),
    allowing for continuous, life long contractions
-   The interconnected network of cells is separated between atria and
    ventricles, allowing them to contract separately

Skill:

â€¢ Â Measurement and interpretation of the heart rate under different
conditionsÂ 

â€¢ Â Interpretation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure
measurements

Â  Â Â 
Cardiac output describes the amount of blood the heart pumps through the
circulatory system in one minute

-   It is an important medical indicator of how efficiently the heart
    can meet the demands of the body

There are two key factors which contribute to cardiac output â€“ heart
rate and stroke volume

-   Equation: Â Cardiac Output (CO) = Heart Rate (HR)Â Ã—Â Stroke Volume
    (SV)

[cardiac output]

Heart Rate

Heart rate describes the speed at which the heart beats, measured by the
number of contractions per minute (or bpm)

-   Each ventricular contraction forces a wave of blood through the
    arteries which can be detected as a pulse
-   The typical pulse rate for a healthy adult is between 60 â€“ 100
    beats per minute

Heart rate can be affected by a number of conditions â€“ including
exercise, age, disease, temperature and emotional state

-   Additionally, the body will attempt to compensate for any changes to
    stroke volume with a corrective alteration to heart rate

An individualâ€™s heart rate is controlled by both nervous and hormonal
signals:

-   Heart rate is increased by the sympathetic nervous system and
    decreased by parasympathetic stimulation (vagus nerve)
-   Heart rate can also be increased hormonally via the action of
    adrenaline / epinephrine

Blood Pressure

Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped to the body (from the left
ventricle) with each beat of the heart

-   It is affected by the volume of blood in the body, the contractility
    of the heart and the level of resistance from blood vessels

Changes in stroke volume will affect the blood pressure â€“ more blood
or more resistance will increase the overall pressure

-   Blood pressure measurements typically include two readings â€“
    representing systolic and diastolic blood pressures
-   Systolic blood pressure is higher, as it represents the pressure of
    the blood following the contraction of the heart
-   Diastolic blood pressure is lower, as it represents the pressure of
    the blood while the heart is relaxing between beats

Blood pressure readings will vary depending on the site of measurement
(e.g. arteries have much higher pressure than veins)

-   A typical adult is expected to have an approximate blood pressure in
    their brachial artery of 120/80 mmHg to 140/90 mmHg
-   Blood pressure can be affected by posture, blood vessel diameter
    (e.g. vasodilation) and fluid retention or loss

Blood Pressure Changes in the Circulatory SystemÂ 

[blood pressure]
Circulation

Cardiac output describes the volume of blood pumped out of the heart per
minute

-   It is roughly 5 litres per minute in a typical human adult at rest
    (it increases to ~25 L/min during heavy exercise)

Blood is distributed to body organs according to physiological
requirements and this distribution changes with exercise:

-   Blood flow to the brain is largely unchanged during exercise (brain
    is vital and hence blood flow cannot be altered)
-   Blood flow to the heart wall, muscles and skin is increased (to
    facilitate improved oxygenation and heat loss)
-   Blood flow to the kidneys, liver and digestive system is decreased
    (due to minimal absorption and excretion)

Blood vessels will vasodilate during exercise to improve circulation and
facilitate heat loss via the skin

-   This moves blood closer to the surface of the skin and is why
    exercise causes a person to appear flushed

Skill:

â€¢ Â Mapping of the cardiac cycle to a normal ECG trace

Â  Â Â 
The cardiac cycle describes the series of events that take place in the
heart over the duration of a single heart beat

-   It is comprised of a period of contraction (systole) and relaxation
    (diastole)

The cardiac cycle can be mapped by recording the electrical activity of
the heart with each contraction

-   Activity is measured using a machine called an electrocardiograph to
    generate data called an electrocardiogram
-   Hint: Â In a similar fashion, you use a telegraph (machine) to send
    a telegram (data)

Each normal heart beat should follow the same sequence of electrical
events:

-   TheÂ P waveÂ represents depolarisation of the atria in response to
    signalling from the sinoatrial node (i.e. atrial contraction)
-   TheÂ QRS complexÂ represents depolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular contraction), triggered by signals from the AV node
-   TheÂ T waveÂ represents repolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular relaxation) and the completion of a standard heart beat
-   Between these periods of electrical activity are intervals allowing
    for blood flow (PR intervalÂ andÂ ST segment)

Electrical Activity of the Heart

[ECG]

Examples of Heart Conditions

Data generated via electrocardiography can be used to identify a variety
of heart conditions, including:

-   TachycardiaÂ (elevated resting heart rate = >120Â bpm)
    andÂ bradycardiaÂ (depressed resting heart rate = < 40 bpm)
-   ArrhythmiasÂ (irregular heart beats that are so common in young
    people that it is not technically considered a disease)
-   FibrillationsÂ (unsynchronised contractions of either atria or
    ventricles leading to dangerously spasmodic heart activity)

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of hypertension and thrombosis

Â  Â Â 
Hypertension

-   Hypertension is defined as an abnormally high blood pressure â€“
    either systolic, diastolic or both (e.g. > 140/90 mmHg)
-   Common causes of hypertension include a sedentary lifestyle, salt or
    fat-rich diets and excessive alcohol or tobacco use
-   High blood pressure can also be secondary to other conditions (e.g.
    kidney disease) or caused by some medications
-   Hypertension itself does not cause symptoms but in the long-term
    leads to consequences caused by narrowing blood vessels

Thrombosis

-   Thrombosis is the formation of a clot within a blood vessel that
    forms part of the circulatory system
-   Thrombosis occurs in arteries when the vessels are damaged as a
    result of the deposition of cholesterol (atherosclerosis)
-   Atheromas (fat deposits) develop in the arteries and significantly
    reduce the diameter of the vessel (leading to hypertension)
-   The high blood pressure damages the arterial wall, forming lesions
    known as atherosclerotic plaques
-   If a plaque ruptures, blood clotting is triggered, forming a
    thrombus that restricts blood flow
-   If the thrombus becomes dislodged it becomes an embolus and can
    cause blockage at another site
-   Thrombosis in the coronary arteries leads to heart attacks, while
    thrombosis in the brain causes strokes

Causes and Consequences of Coronary Thrombosis

[coronary thrombosis]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of epidemiological data relating to the incidence of
coronary heart disease

Â  Â Â 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) describes the condition caused by the build
up of plaque within the coronary arteries

-   It is essentially the consequence of atherosclerosis in the blood
    vessels that supply and sustain heart tissue

The incidence of coronary heart disease will vary in different
populations according to the occurrence of certain risk factors

-   E.g. The incidence of CHD under the age of 65 is substantially
    higher in indigenous Australians (versus non indigenous)Â 

[goddess]

There are several risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD),
including:

-   AgeÂ â€“ Blood vessels become less flexible with advancing age
-   GeneticsÂ â€“ Having hypertension predispose individuals to
    developing CHDÂ 
-   ObesityÂ â€“ Being overweight places an additional strain on the
    heart
-   DiseasesÂ â€“ Certain diseases increase the risk of CHD (e.g.
    diabetes)
-   DietÂ â€“ Diets rich in saturated fats, salts and alcohol increases
    the risk
-   ExerciseÂ â€“ Sedentary lifestyles increase the risk of developing
    CHD
-   SexÂ â€“ Males are at a greater risk due to lower oestrogen levels
-   SmokingÂ â€“ Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, raising blood
    pressure

Heart Measurements

Diagnostic measurements can be taken using a range of devices to test
the efficiency of the cardiovascular system

-   Two common tests performed are auscultation and blood pressure
    measurements

Auscultation

-   Auscultation involves listening to the internal sounds of body
    organs, by using a stethoscope
-   Auscultation is commonly used to listen to the different heart
    sounds in order to assess the health of the heart
-   By placing the stethoscope at different points on the chest, the
    closure of each of the four heart valves can be heard
-   This allows physicians to determine if the heart is functioning
    normallyÂ 

Measuring Heart Sounds via Auscultation

[auscultation]

Blood Pressure

Blood pressure measurements include two readings â€“ a systolic pressure
and a diastolic pressure

-   The systolic pressure is a higher value that represents the pressure
    in the vessel when the heart is contracting (i.e. pulse flow)
-   The diastolic pressure is a lower value that represents the pressure
    in the vessel when the heart is relaxing

Blood pressure is measured in arteries using a sphygmomanometer (veins
do not have sufficient pressure to be easily detected)

-   The sphygmomanometer is a blood pressure cuff that cuts off
    circulation to a region (typically the brachial artery in the arm)
-   The pressure of the cuff is slowly released until a pulse can be
    audibly detected with a stethoscope (systolic pressure)Â 
-   The pressure continues to be released from the cuff until a pulse
    can no longer be audibly detected (diastolic pressure)
-   A normal blood pressure for a healthy adult is approximately 120 /
    80 mmHg

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Normal heart sounds are caused by the AV valves and semilunar
valves closing causing changes in blood flow

Â  Â Â 
The heart contains a number of heart valves which prevent the backflow
of blood

-   This ensures the one-way circulation of blood around the body

There are two sets of valves located within the heart:

-   Atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and bicuspid) prevent blood in
    the ventricles from flowing back into the atria
-   Semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic) prevent blood in the
    arteries from flowing back into the ventricles

Heart sounds are made when these two sets of valves close in response to
pressure changes within the heart

-   The first heart sound is caused by the closure of the
    atrioventricular valves at the start of ventricular systole
-   The second heart sound is caused by the closure of the semilunar
    valves at the start of ventricular diastole

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of artificial pacemakers to regulate the heart rate

Â  Â Â 
An artificial pacemaker is a medical device that delivers electrical
impulses to the heart in order to regulate heart rate

-   Modern pacemakers are externally programmable, allowing
    cardiologists to make adjustments as required

Artificial pacemakers are typically used to treat one of two
conditions:Â 

-   Abnormally slow heart rates (bradycardia)
-   Arrhythmias arising from blockages within the heartâ€™s electrical
    conduction system

Artificial Pacemaker

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of defibrillation to treat life threatening cardiac conditions

Â  Â Â 
Fibrillation is the rapid, irregular and unsynchronised contraction of
the heart muscle fibres

-   This causes heart muscle to convulse spasmodically rather than beat
    in concert, preventing the optimal flow of blood

Fibrillation is treated by applying a controlled electrical current to
the heart via a device called a defibrillator

-   This functions to depolarise the heart tissue in an effort to
    terminate unsynchronised contractions
-   Once heart tissue is depolarised, normal sinus rhythm should
    hopefully be re-established by the sinoatrial node

Essential Idea:
Internal and external factors

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Structure of cardiac muscle cells allows propagation of stimuli
    through the heart wall
-   Signals from the sinoatrial node that cause contraction cannot pass
    directly from atria to ventricles
-   There is a delay between the arrival and passing on of a stimulus at
    the atrioventricular node
-   This delay allows time for atrial systole before the
    atrioventricular valves close
-   Conducting fibres ensure coordinated contraction of the entire
    ventricle wall
-   Normal heart sounds are caused by the atrioventricular valves and
    semilunar valves closing causing changes in blood flow

-   Use of artificial pacemakers to regulate the heart rate

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream

Â  Â Â 
The endocrine system is comprised of ductless glands that release
chemicals into the blood to regulate body functions

-   AÂ hormoneÂ is a chemical messenger that is transported
    indiscriminately via the bloodstream to act on distant target cells
-   Hormones areÂ specificÂ and will only activate cells or tissues that
    possess the appropriate target receptor
-   The endocrine system is slower to initiate, but has a more prolonged
    response when compared to the nervous system

Endocrine Signalling

[endocrine]

Endocrine Glands

Endocrine glands secrete their product (hormones) directly into the
bloodstream, rather than through a duct (e.g. exocrine gland)

-   Major endocrine glands include the pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid
    gland, pineal gland and the gonads (ovaries and testes)
-   The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine glands and
    function to link the nervous and endocrine systems
-   Some organs may also secrete hormones despite not being endocrine
    glands (e.g. adipose tissue secretes leptin)

Examples of Endocrine Glands

[endocrine table]
Feedback Loops

Physiological processes are commonly moderated via two distinct feedback
mechanisms â€“positive and negative feedback

-   Homeostatic processes are controlled byÂ negative feedbackÂ and
    hence these systems occur more commonly within the body

Negative Feedback

Negative feedback involves a response that is theÂ reverseÂ of the
change detected (it functions toÂ reduceÂ the change)

-   A change is detected by a receptor and an effector is activated to
    induce an opposite effect â€“ this promotes equilibrium

Examples of processes that utilise negative feedback loops include
homeostatic systems, such as:

-   Thermoregulation (if body temperature changes, mechanisms are
    induced to restore normal levels)
-   Blood sugar regulation (insulin lowers blood glucose when levels are
    high ; glucagon raises blood glucose when levels are low)
-   Osmoregulation (ADH is secreted to retain water when dehydrated and
    its release is inhibited when the body is hydrated)

Example of a Negative Feedback Loop â€“ Thermoregulation

[negative feedback]

Positive Feedback

Positive feedback involves a response thatÂ reinforcesÂ the change
detected (it functions toÂ amplifyÂ the change)

-   A change is detected by a receptor and an effector is activated to
    induce the same effect â€“ this promotes further change
-   Positive feedback loops will continue to amplify the initial change
    until the stimulus is removed

Examples of processes that utilise positive feedback loops include:

-   Childbirth â€“ stretching of uterine walls cause contractions that
    further stretch the walls (this continues until birthing occurs)
-   Lactation â€“ the child feeding stimulates milk production which
    causes further feeding (continues until baby stops feeding)
-   Ovulation â€“ the dominant follicle releasesÂ oestrogen which
    stimulates LH and FSH release to promote further follicular growth
-   Blood clotting â€“ platelets release clotting factors which cause
    more platelets to aggregate at the site of injury

Example of a Positive Feedback Loop â€“ Child Birth

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Some athletes take growth hormones to build muscles

Â  Â Â 
Growth hormone (also known as somatotropin) is an anabolic peptide
hormone that stimulates growth

-   It acts directly to reduce the formation of adipose cells (i.e. less
    nutrients stored as fat)
-   It acts indirectly via insulin growth factor (IGF) â€“ produced by
    the liver â€“ to increase muscle mass and bone size

Due to its role in promoting growth and regeneration, it is used by some
athletes as a performance enhancer

-   The use of human growth hormone is banned in sports, with proven
    cases of doping strictly punished
-   Traditional urine testing could not detect doping, which
    historically made bans difficult to enforce
-   Recent blood tests can now identify between natural and artificial
    variants of growth hormone

Effects of Growth Hormone on Athletic Capacity

[growth hormone]
Hormone Comparison

Hormones can be categorised into three distinct groups according to
their chemical composition

-   The three types of hormones are steroid hormones, peptide hormones
    and amino acid derivatives
-   The different types of hormones will have different mechanisms of
    action due to their distinct chemical properties

Types of Hormones

[types of hormones]
D5 Â Hormones and Metabolism

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Hormones are not secreted at a uniform rate
and exert their effect at low concentrations

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream
-   Steroid hormones bind to receptor proteins in the cytoplasm of the
    target cell to form a receptor-hormone complex
-   The receptor-hormone complex promotes the transcription of specific
    genes
-   Peptide hormones bind to receptors in the plasma membrane of the
    target cell
-   Binding of hormones to membrane receptors activates a cascade
    mediated by a second messenger inside the cell
-   The hypothalamus controls hormone secretion by the anterior and
    posterior lobes of the pituitary gland
-   Hormones secreted by the pituitary control growth, developmental
    changes, reproduction and homeostasis

Applications:

-   Some athletes take growth hormones to build muscles
-   Control of milk secretion by oxytocin and prolactin
Iodine Deficiency

Certain hormones may require specifc precursor molecules in order to be
synthesised by the body

-   Thyroxin contains iodine within its chemical structure and cannot be
    produced if iodine is deficient in the diet
-   Iodine deficiency will therefore effect the thyroid gland â€“ where
    thyroxin is produced
-   IndividualsÂ with an iodine deficiency will develop an enlarged
    thyroid gland â€“ a condition known as goitre

Iodine deficiency is common in many countries, asÂ iodine is not a
common component of most diets (sea food excepted)

-   The International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency
    Disorders works to eliminate the harm of iodine deficiency
-   One strategy employed is to add iodine to common dietary products
    (e.g. iodised table salt)

Application:

â€¢ Â Control of milk secretion by oxytocin and prolactin

Â  Â Â 
The production and secretion of milk by maternal mammary glands
following birth is called lactation

-   It is predominantly controlled and regulated by two key hormones â€“
    oxytocin and prolactinÂ 

Prolactin is responsible for the development of the mammary glands and
the production of milk

-   It is secreted by the anterior pituitary in response to the release
    of PRH (prolactin releasing hormone) from the hypothalamus
-   The effects of prolactin are inhibited by progesterone, which
    prevents milk production from occurring prior to birth

Oxytocin is responsible for the release of milk from the mammary glands
(milk ejection reflex)

-   It is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by neurosecretory
    cells that extend into the posterior pituitary
-   Oxytocin release is triggered by stimulation of sensory receptors in
    the breast tissue by the suckling infant
-   This creates a positive feedback loop that will result in continuous
    oxytocin secretion until the infant stops feeding

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The hypothalamus controls hormone secretion by the anterior and
posterior lobes of the pituitary gland

Â  Â Â 
Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the section of the brain that links the nervous and
endocrine systems in order to maintain homeostasis

-   It receives information from nerves throughout the body and other
    parts of the brain and initiates endocrine responses
-   It secretes neurochemicals (called releasing factors) into a portal
    system which target the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland
-   It also secretes hormones directly into the blood via neurosecretory
    cells that extend into the posterior pituitary lobe

Pituitary Gland

The pituitary gland lies adjacent to the hypothalamus and is in direct
contact due to a portal blood system

-   The pituitary gland receives instructions from the hypothalamus and
    consists of two lobes (anterior and posterior lobe)

Anterior Lobe

-   The anterior lobe is also called the
    adenohypophysisÂ (â€˜adenoâ€™Â = relating to glands)
-   The hypothalamus produces releasing factors, which are released into
    portal vessels by neurosecretory cells
-   The releasing factors cause endocrine cells in the anterior
    pituitary to release specific hormones into the bloodstream
    -   An example of a releasing factor is GnRH, which triggers the
        release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary

Posterior Lobe

-   The posterior lobe is also called the neurohypophysisÂ (â€˜neuroâ€™
    = relating to nerves)
-   The posterior lobe releases hormones produced by the hypothalamus
    itself (via neurosecretory cells)
-   These neurosecretory cells extend into the posterior lobe from the
    hypothalamus and release hormones into the blood

Endocrine Signalling via the Pituitary Gland

[pituitary gland]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hormones secreted by the pituitary control growth, developmental
changes, reproduction and homeostasis

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ pituitary gland is often referred to as theÂ â€˜master glandâ€™, as
it controls the secretion of a number of other endocrine glands

-   Pituitary hormones will often target endocrine glands in other
    organs (e.g. gonads, pancreas, thyroid, mammary gland)

[marge]

Pituitary hormones hence control many vital body processes, including:

-   MetabolismÂ  (e.g. TSH activates thyroxin)
-   Adult DevelopmentÂ  (e.g. LH / FSH trigger puberty)
-   ReproductionÂ  (e.g. LH / FSH control menstruation)
-   Growth Â (e.g. growth hormone promotes growth)
-   Equilibrium / Homeostasis Â (e.g. ADH and water balance)

cells to form a receptor-hormone complex

â€¢ Â The receptor-hormone complex promotes the transcription of

Â  Â Â 
Steroid Hormones

-   Steroid hormones are lipophilic (fat-loving) â€“ meaning they can
    freely diffuse across the plasma membrane of a cell
-   They bind to receptors in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of the
    target cell, to form an active receptor-hormone complex
-   This activated complex will move into the nucleus and bind directly
    to DNA, acting as a transcription factor for gene expression
-   Examples of steroid hormones include those produced by the gonads
    (i.e. estrogen, progesterone and testosterone)

[steroid hormones]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Peptide hormones bind to receptors in the plasma membrane of the
target cell

â€¢ Â Binding to membrane receptors activates a cascade mediated by a
second messenger inside the cell

Â  Â Â 
Peptide Hormones

-   Peptide hormones are hydrophylic and lipophobic (fat-hating) â€“
    meaning they cannot freely cross the plasma membrane
-   They bind to receptors on the surface of the cell, which are
    typically coupled to internally anchored proteins (e.g. G proteins)
-   The receptor complex activates a series of intracellular molecules
    called second messengers, which initiate cell activity
-   This process is called signal transduction, because the external
    signal (hormone) is transduced via internal intermediaries
-   Examples of second messengers include cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium
    ions (Ca²⁺), nitric oxide (NO) and protein kinases
-   The use of second messengers enables the amplification of the
    initial signal (as more molecules are activated)
-   Peptide hormones include insulin, glucagon, leptin, ADH and oxytocin

[peptide hormones]
Types of Signalling

Cells communicate via various types of signalling by which chemicals
travel to target sites in order to elicit a response

-   Different types of cell signalling include autocrine, paracrine and
    endocrine signalling

Autocrine

-   Autocrine signalling occurs when the chemicals released by a cell
    stimulate the cell itself (i.e.Â â€˜selfâ€™ signalling)
-   An example is the proliferation of T lymphocytes following cytokine
    release from an activated T lymphocyte

Paracrine

-   Paracrine signalling occurs when the chemicals released by a cell
    stimulate a neighbouring cell
-   An example is the stimulation of post-synaptic neurons by
    neurotransmitters released from a pre-synapticÂ neuron

Endocrine

-   Endocrine signalling occurs when a chemical released by a cell
    travels in the bloodstream to activate distant cells
-   An example is the release of hormones from endocrine glands to
    activate distant target tissue

Different Types of Cell Signalling

[cell signalling]

Types of Secretion

Hormones are released indiscriminately into the bloodstream and only
activate cells and tissues with specific receptors

-   While hormonal responses are slower than nervous responses, the
    duration of effect can be longer
-   Hormones work at low concentrations, but sustained release is viable
    if hormones are stored within the secretory cells

Hormonal secretion can either be constitutive or regulated according to
need:

-   In constitutive secretion, hormones are released as they are
    produced (vesicles fuse directly with the cell membrane)
-   In regulated secretion, hormones are stored in vesicles and only
    released following an external signal

Constitutive versus Regulated Secretion

[secretion]
Asthma

Asthma is a common, chronic inflammation of the airways to the lungs
(i.e. bronchi and bronchioles)

-   Inflammation leads to swelling and mucus production, resulting in
    reduced airflow andÂ bronchospasm
-   During an acute asthma attack, constriction of the bronchi smooth
    muscle may cause significant airflow obstruction
-   Common symptoms of an asthma attack include shortness of breath,
    chest tightness, wheezing and coughing
-   Severe cases of asthma may be life threatening if left untreated

Asthma may be caused by a number of environmental triggers, including:

[ass face]

-   Allergens (e.g. pollen, moulds)
-   Smoke / scented products (e.g. perfumes, cigarettes)
-   Stress and anxiety
-   Food preservatives and certain medications
-   Arthropods (e.g. dust mites)
-   Cold air
-   Exercise (increases respiratory rate)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in blood pH

Â  Â Â 
Aqueous carbon dioxide may combine with water in blood plasma to form
carbonic acid (H₂CO₃)

-   Carbonic acid may then lose protons (H⁺) to form bicarbonate
    (HCO₃^(â€“)) or carbonate (CO₃^(2â€“))
-   The released hydrogen ions will function to lower the pH of the
    solution, making the blood plasma less alkaline

Chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in blood pH and can trigger body
responses in order to maintain a balance

-   The lungs can regulate the amount of carbon dioxide in the
    bloodstream by changing the rate of ventilation
-   The kidneys can control the reabsorption of bicarbonate ions from
    the filtrate and clear any excess in the urine

Regulation of Blood pH

[blood pH]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â pH of blood is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35
to 7.45

Â  Â Â 
The pH of blood is required to stay within a very narrow tolerance range
(7.35 â€“ 7.45) in order to avoid the onset of diseaseÂ 

-   This pH range is, in part, maintained by plasma proteins which act
    as buffers

A buffering solution resists changes to pH by removing excess H⁺ ions
(â†‘ acidity) or OH^(â€“) ions (â†‘ alkalinity)

-   Amino acids are zwitterions â€“ they may have both a positive and
    negative charge and hence can buffer changes in pH
-   The amine group may take on H⁺ ions while the carboxyl group may
    release H⁺ ions (which form water with OH^(â€“) ions)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The Bohr shift explains the increased release of oxygen by
haemoglobin in respiring tissues

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ oxyhaemoglobinÂ dissociation curve demonstrates the saturation of
haemoglobin by oxygen under normal conditions

-   pH changes alter the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen and hence
    alters the uptake and release of O₂ by haemoglobin

Carbon dioxide lowers the pH of the blood (by forming carbonic acid),
which causes haemoglobin to release its oxygen

-   This is known as the Bohr effect â€“ a decrease in pH shifts the
    oxygen dissociation curve to the right

Cells with increased metabolism (i.e. respiring tissues) release greater
amounts of carbon dioxide (product of cell respiration)

-   Hence haemoglobin is promoted to release its oxygen at the regions
    of greatest need (oxygen is an input of cell respiration)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is carried in solution and bound to haemoglobin in
the blood

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is transformed in red blood cells into hydrogen
carbonate ions

Â  Â Â 
Carbon dioxide is transported between the lungs and the tissues by one
of three mechanisms:

-   Some is bound to haemoglobin to form HbCO₂ (carbon dioxide binds to
    the globin and so doesnâ€™t compete with O₂ binding)
-   A very small fraction gets dissolved in water and is carried in
    solution (~5% â€“ carbon dioxide dissolves poorly in water)
-   The majority (~75%) diffuses into the erythrocyte and gets converted
    into carbonic acid

Transport as Carbonic Acid

-   When CO₂ enters the erythrocyte, it combines with water to form
    carbonic acid (reaction catalysed by carbonic anhydrase)
-   The carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) then dissociates to form hydrogen ions
    (H⁺) and bicarbonate (HCO₃^(â€“))
-   Bicarbonate is pumped out of the cell in exchange with chloride ions
    (exchange ensures the erythrocyte remains uncharged)
-   The bicarbonate in the blood plasma combines with sodium to form
    sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), which travels to the lungs
-   The hydrogen ions within the erythrocyte make the environment less
    alkaline, causing haemoglobin to release its oxygen
-   The haemoglobin absorbs the H⁺ ions and acts as a buffer to maintain
    the intracellular pH
-   When the red blood cell reaches the lungs, bicarbonate is pumped
    back into the cell and the entire process is reversed

Emphysema

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and treatments of emphysema

Â  Â Â 
Emphysema is a lung condition whereby the walls of the alveoli lose
their elasticity due to damage to the alveolar walls

-   The loss of elasticity results in the abnormal enlargement of the
    alveoli, leading to a lower total surface area for gas exchange
-   The degradation of the alveolar walls can cause holes to develop and
    alveoli to merge into huge air spaces (pulmonaryÂ bullae)

Causes

The major cause of emphysema isÂ smoking, as the chemical irritants in
cigarette smoke damage the alveolar walls

-   The damage to lung tissue leads to the recruitment of phagocytes to
    the region, which produce an enzyme called elastase
-   This elastase, released as part of an inflammatory response, breaks
    down the elastic fibres in the alveolar wall
-   A small proportion of emphysema cases are due to a hereditary
    deficiency in this enzyme inhibitor due to a gene mutation

Treatments

There is no current cure for emphysema, but treaments are available to
relieve symptoms and delay disease progression

-   Bronchodilators are commonly used to relax the bronchiolar muscles
    and improve airflow
-   Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammatory response that breaks
    down the elastic fibres in the alveolar wall
-   Elastase activity can be blocked by an enzyme inhibitor
    (Î±-1-antitrypsin), provided elastase concentrations are not too
    high
-   Oxygen supplementation will be required in the later stages of the
    disease to ensure adequate oxygen intake
-   In certain cases, surgery and alternative medicines have helped to
    decrease the severity of symptoms

Application:

â€¢ Â Consequences of high altitude for gas exchange

Â  Â Â 
Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by a single type of gas when it
is found within a mixture of gases

The partial pressure of a given gas will be determined by:

-   The concentration of the gas within the mixture (e.g. oxygen forms
    roughly 21% of the atmosphere)
-   The total pressure of the mixture (e.g. atmospheric pressure)

At high altitudes, air pressure is lower and hence there is a lower
partial pressure of oxygen (less O₂ because less air overall)

-   This makes it more difficult for haemoglobin to take up and
    transport oxygen (lower Hb % saturation)
-   Consequently, respiring tissue will receive less oxygen â€“ leading
    to symptoms such as fatigue, headaches and rapid pulse

Over time, the body may begin to acclimatise to the lower oxygen levels
at high altitudes:

-   Red blood cell production will increase in order to maximise oxygen
    uptake and transport
-   Red blood cells will have a higher haemoglobin count with a higher
    affinity for oxygen
-   Vital capacity will increase to improve rate of gas exchange
-   Muscles will produce more myoglobin and have increased
    vascularisation to improve overall oxygen supplyÂ 
-   Kidneys will begin to secrete alkaline urine (removal of excess
    bicarbonates improves buffering of blood pH)
-   People living permanently at high altitudes will have a greater lung
    surface area and larger chest sizes

Professional athletes will often incorporate high altitude training in
order to adopt these benefits prior to competition

-   Athletes may commonly either train at high altitudes (live low â€“
    train high) or recover at high altitudes (live high â€“ train low)

    carbonate ions
-   The Bohr shift explains the increased release of oxygen by
    haemoglobin in respiring tissues
-   Chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in blood pH

Lung Cancer

Lung cancer describes the uncontrolled proliferation of lung cells,
leading to the abnormal growth of lung tissue (tumour)

-   The abnormal growth can impact on normal tissue function, leading to
    a variety of symptoms according to size and location
-   The tumours can remain in place (benign) or spread to other regions
    of the body (malignant)

Lung cancers are the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide
for two main reasons:

-   The lungs are vital to normal body function and thus the abrogation
    of their normal function is particularly detrimental to health
-   The lungs possess a very rich blood supply, increasing the
    likelihood of the cancer spreading (metastasis) to other body
    regions

The common symptoms of lung cancers include coughing up blood, wheezing,
respiratory distress and weight loss

-   If the cancer mass compresses adjacent organs it can cause chest
    pain, difficulty swallowing and heart complications

There are many causes for lung cancer, including smoking, asbestos, air
pollution, certain infections and genetic predispositions

The inner surface of the alveolus is lined by a special type of alveolar
cell called a pneumocyte

-   Type I pneumocytes are very thin in order to mediate gas exchange
    with the bloodstream (via diffusion)
-   Type IIÂ pneumocytes secrete a pulmonary surfactant in order to
    reduce the surface tension within the alveoli

Alveolar air spaces are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries,
which transport respiratory gases to and from the lungs

-   The capillaries are located close to the pneumocytes and are
    composed of a very thin, single-layer endothelium
-   The capillaries transport oxygen within red blood cells, while white
    blood cells may extravasate into the lung tissue

Oxygen Dissociation Curve

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Oxygen dissociation curves show the affinity of haemoglobin for
oxygen

Â  Â Â 
Oxygen is transported throughout the body in red blood cells, which
contain an oxygen-binding protein called haemoglobin

-   Haemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide chains, each with an
    iron-containing heme group that reversibly binds oxygen
-   As such, each haemoglobin can reversibly bind up to four oxygen
    molecules (Hb + 4O₂ = HbO₈)

As each O₂ molecule binds, it alters the conformation of haemoglobin,
making subsequent binding easier (cooperative binding)

-   This means haemoglobin will have a higher affinity for O₂ in
    oxygen-rich areas (like the lung), promoting oxygen loading
-   Conversely, haemoglobin will have a lower affinity for O₂ in
    oxygen-starved areas (like muscles), promoting oxygen unloading

Cooperative Binding of Haemoglobin

[oxyhaemoglobin]

Oxygen dissociation curves show the relationship between oxygen levels
(as partial pressure) and haemoglobin saturation

-   Because binding potential changes with each additional O₂ molecule,
    the saturation of haemoglobin is not linear

Adult Haemoglobin

-   The oxygen dissociation curve for adult haemoglobin is sigmoidal
    (i.e. S-shaped) due to cooperative binding
-   There is a low saturation of haemoglobin when oxygen levels are low
    (haemoglobin releases O₂ in hypoxic tissues)
-   There is a high saturation of haemoglobin when oxygen levels are
    high (haemoglobin binds O₂ in oxygen-rich tissues)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fetal hemoglobin is different from adultÂ hemoglobin allowing the
transfer of oxygen in the placenta onto the

Â  Â Â fetal hemoglobin

Â  Â Â 
Fetal Haemoglobin

-   The haemoglobin of the foetus has a slightly different molecular
    composition to adult haemoglobin
-   Consequently, it has a higher affinity for oxygen (dissociation
    curve is shifted to the left)
-   This is important as it means fetal haemoglobin will load oxygen
    when adult haemoglobin is unloading it (i.e. in the placenta)
-   Following birth, fetal haemoglobin is almost completely replaced by
    adult haemoglobin (~ 6 monthsÂ post-natally)
-   Fetal haemoglobin production can be pharmacologically induced in
    adults to treat diseases such as sickle cell anaemia

Oxygen Dissociation Curve â€“ Fetal Haemoglobin

[fetal dissociation curve]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of oxygen dissociation curves for haemoglobin and
myoglobin

Â  Â Â 
Myoglobin

-   Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding molecule that is found in skeletal
    muscle tissue
-   It is made of a single polypeptide with only one heme group and
    hence is not capable of cooperative binding
-   Consequently, the oxygen dissociation curve for myoglobin is not
    sigmoidal (it isÂ logarithmic)
-   Myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult haemoglobin
    and becomes saturated at lower oxygen levels
-   Myoglobin will hold onto its oxygen supply until levels in the
    muscles are very low (e.g. during intense physical activity)
-   The delayed release of oxygen helps to slow the onset of anaerobic
    respiration and lactic acid formation during exercise

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The rate of ventilation is controlled by the respiratory control
centre in the medulla oblongata

â€¢ Â During exercise the rate of ventilation changes in response to the
amount of CO₂ in the blood

Â  Â Â 
The respiratory control centre in the medulla oblongata responds to
stimuli from chemoreceptors in order to control ventilation

-   Central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata detect changes in
    CO₂ levels (as changes in pH of cerebrospinal fluid)
-   Peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies also
    detect CO₂ levels, as well as O₂ levels and blood pH

During exercise metabolism is increased, which results in a build up of
carbon dioxide and a reduction in the supply of oxygen

-   These changes are detected by chemoreceptors and impulses are sent
    to the respiratory control centre in the brainstem
-   Signals are sent to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to
    increase the rate of ventilation (this process is involuntary)
-   As the ventilation rate increases, CO₂ levels in the blood will
    drop, restoring blood pH (also O₂ levels will rise)
-   Long term effects of continual exercise may include an improved
    vital capacityÂ

Archaea versus Eubacteria

Traditional classification schemes separated organisms into two main
groups â€“ prokaryotes and eukaryotes

-   This classification scheme was widely entrenched until 1977 when
    Carl Woese proposed a new system

The large diversity of organisms classified as prokaryotes prompted
Woese to separate these bacteria into two distinct domains

-   EubacteriaÂ includes most of the commonly encountered bacterial
    forms (i.e. pathogenic bacteria and probiotic bacteria)
-   ArchaeaÂ consists of the extremophiles (e.g. thermophiles,
    halophiles, methanogens, etc.)

The archaeal cells were found to possess certain features that were more
in common with eukaryotic cells than eubacteria

-   This included certain structural features (e.g. cell wall
    composition) and the presence of histone-like proteins in DNA
-   Based on these discoveries it was concluded that eukaryotes and
    archaea share more recent common ancestry than eubacteria

Skill:

â€¢ Â Experiments showing zone of inhibition of bacterial growth by
bactericides in sterile bacterial cultures

Â  Â Â 
Bactericides are substances which kill bacteria â€“ they include certain
types of disinfectants, antiseptics and antibiotics

-   Whereas bactericidal agents will kill bacteria, bacteriostatic
    agents function by slowing their growth and reproduction

The efficacy of a particular bactericide can be tested by examining its
effect on bacterial growth in a sterile bacterial culture

-   If a bactericide is effective against a particular bacterial strain,
    there will be no growth around the agent (zone of inhibition)
-   The larger the zone of inhibition, the more effective the
    bactericidal agent is at killing the bacterial strain

The zone of inhibition will also be affected by the solubility of the
bactericide (i.e. fast diffusion rate = large zone of inhibition)

-   This is an important consideration when testing multiple
    bactericides on the same growth medium

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fermentation is carried out by batch or continuous culture

Â  Â Â 
Batch Culture

-   Fermentation is carried out in a closed fermenter, with nothing
    added or removed during the process (except venting of gas)
-   Microorganisms and nutrients are left for a set period of time,
    during which the nutrient stock is depleted
-   The advantage of a batch culture is that the fermenter can be used
    for different reactions with each separate use
-   A disadvantage of a batch culture is that it results in significant
    periods of idle time between use, resulting in higher costs

Continuous Culture

-   Fermentation is carried out in an open fermenter, with nutrients
    added and product removed at a steady rate throughout
-   This results in a continuous reaction with no idle time, reducing
    labour costs and increasing product yields
-   A disadvantage of continuous culture is that there is a higher risk
    of contamination due to the constant adjustments
-   Continuous fermentation is feasible only when the inoculated cells
    are genetically stable

Â  Â Â 
The antibiotic penicillin can be mass produced via the use of deep-tank
batch fermentation

-   Large industrial fermenters are constructed that have the capacity
    to hold thousands of litres
-   Penicillium mold is grown in the deep-tank batch fermenters
    following the addition of sugars and other key ingredients
-   The production process typically lasts 6 â€“ 8 days, with the
    fermenter drained at the end of the fermentation cycle
-   Penicillin is separated from the solution and purified via
    downstream processing to improve its antibiotic potential

â€¢ Â Production of citric acid in continuous fermenters by Aspergillus
niger for use as a preservative or flavouring

Â  Â Â 
Citric acid (citrate) is widely used as a flavour enhancer, a
preservative in manufactured foods and an antioxidant

-   It is produced as an intermediate of the Krebs cycle under aerobic
    conditions

Citric acid is mass produced by continuous fermenter systems from
cultures of the fungus Aspergillus niger

-   Carbohydrates are continuously introduced into the fermenter in
    order to maintain the citric acid production
-   Iron (Fe²⁺ ions) is excluded from the mixture in order to slow the
    further conversion of citric acid within the Krebs cycle
-   As citric acid accumulates it is extracted as part of the medium
    that is being continuously withdrawn from the fermenter

Biofuels

Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source as they take several
million years to form through slow geological processes

-   Fossil fuels include coal (formed from peat) and oil and natural gas
    (e.g. petroleum)

Biofuels are liquid fuels that are produced from the structural
components (biomass) and waste of plant and animal matter

-   As they are derived from biological processes, they are functionally
    renewable (provided there is a constant stock of reagents)
-   Biofuels may use certain industrial wastes as reagents (e.g. CO₂,
    heat), making them an ecologically sustainable alternative
-   Biofuels include bioethanol and biodiesel, with efforts ongoing to
    develop better purification and refinement techniques

Application:

â€¢ Â Biogas is produced by bacteria and archaeans from organic matter
in fermenters

Â  Â Â 
Biogas is a clean and renewable fuel source produced by the breakdown of
organic matter by particular microorganisms

-   Biogas is primarily composed of methane, carbon dioxide and water
    vapour
-   Biogas can be produced from a variety of sources of biomass â€“
    including manure, sewage, agricultural waste or food scraps

The production of biogas involves two groups of microorganisms â€“
eubacteria and archaeans (methanogens)

-   Bacteria first convert the organic material into organic acids and
    alcohol
-   Other bacteria convert these products into acetate, carbon dioxide
    and hydrogen gas
-   Archaeans then create methane, either via breakdown of acetate or
    via a reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen gasÂ 

The production of biogas can occur in small-scale fermenters under
anaerobic conditions

-   The fermenter needs to be maintained at a neutral pH (~ 7) and
    constant temperature (~ 35ÂºC) to maximise yield

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Production of biogas in a small-scale fermenter

Â  Â Â 
Small-scale biogas fermenters are air-tight containers that
anaerobically break down kitchen and garden wastes to produce biogas

-   The fermentation process produces a digested slurry (digestate),
    which can be used as a fertilizer
-   The biogas forms within the slurry and collects at the top of the
    chamber, where it can be transported for use via an outlet

The main design elements of a biogas fermenters are an air-tight
chamber, an inlet and a vessel for biogas collection

-   A small-scale fermenter can also be directly linked to toilets for
    the additional treatment of human excreta
-   Small-scale biogas fermenters are typically used by households or
    communities in rural areas as a supplementary fuel source

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Microorganisms are used in industry because they are small and
have a fast growth rate

â€¢ Â Microorganisms in fermenters become limited by their own waste
products

Â  Â Â 
Microorganisms are used in industry to produce a range of chemical
compounds, enzymes and drugs â€“ this is because:

-   They are small and so can be grown economically in fermenters on
    either solid or liquid media
-   They have a fast growth rate and so can produce large yields in
    short periods of time
-   They can be genetically modified with relative ease to synthesise
    non-natural products of interest
-   May be able to tolerate unusual growth conditions (e.g.
    extremophiles can grow in high temperatures or acidic conditions)

When grown in fermenters, microorganism rate of growth will eventually
become limited by metabolic waste products

-   The fermentation reaction can be periodically halted to replenish
    nutrients and remove wastes (batch culture)
-   Alternatively, nutrient and waste levels can be dynamically adjusted
    to maintain the reaction indefinitely (continuous culture)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fermenters allow large-scale production of metabolites by
microorganisms

Â  Â Â 
A fermenter is an enclosed and sterilised vessel that maintains optimal
conditions for the growth of a microorganism

-   The microorganism undergoes fermentation to produce large quantities
    of a desired metabolite for commercial use

Product can be collected from a fermenter after a fixed amount of time
(batch cultivation) or ongoing (continuous cultivation)

-   In batch cultivation, the microorganism goes through all the stages
    of growth prior to the collection of product
-   In continuous cultivation, the microorganism is maintained at a peak
    rate of growth (exponential phase)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Probes are used to monitor conditions within fermenters

â€¢ Â Conditions are maintained at optimal levels for the growth of the
microorganism being cultured

Â  Â Â 
Probes and sensors are used to monitor condtions within the fermenter in
order to maintain optimal levels of microbial growth

-   Motorised stirring paddles function to distribute heat and materials
    evenly within the reaction chamber
-   An external water jacket can be used to absorb excess heat and
    maintain a constant viable temperature
-   An aerator can introduced compressed air into the chamber, while a
    defoamer can hinder the formation of foamÂ 
-   Acid/base inlets allow for the regulation of pH levels within the
    chamber (formation of product may alter pH)
-   Nutrient inlets and exhaust outlets allow for the introduction of
    sugars or the removal of metabolic wastes

The necessary adjustments required for continued growth may differ
between batch cultivation and continuous cultivation

-   In both cases, conditions within the fermenter must remain aseptic
    to prevent contamination of the microorganism

Skill:

â€¢ Â Gram staining of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria

Â  Â Â 
Gram staining is a common technique used to differentiate between two
groups of bacteria based on cell wall composition

-   The Gram staining procedure will result in Gram-negative cells
    staining pink and Gram-positive cells staining purple
-   The technique was developed by Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian
    Gram in 1884

Gram-Negative Versus Gram-Positive Bacteria

[Gram bacteria]

Cell Wall Composition

Gram staining identifies two different groups of bacteria based on the
physical and chemical properties of their cell wall:

-   Gram-positive bacteria generally have a single outer membrane
    surrounded by a thick layer of peptidoglycan
-   Gram-negative bacteria generally possess a thin layer of
    peptidoglycan located between two outer membranes

Most bacterial phyla are typically Gram-negative, however many of the
more prevalent bacterial genera are Gram-positive

-   Examples of Gram-negative bacteria include cyanobacteria, salmonella
    and escherichia
-   Examples of Gram-positive bacteria includeÂ bacillus, streptococcus
    and clostridium
-   Some bacteria do not respond predictably to Gram staining (e.g.
    archaeans) and hence cannot be identified by staining

Gram-Negative Versus Gram-Positive Cell Walls

[gram cell walls]

Staining Procedure

Gram staining of bacterial colonies involves four key steps:

-   Heat-fixed cells are stained with crystal violet stain, which
    colours the cells purple
-   Iodine solution is added, which forms a complex with the crystal
    violet stain and traps it within the cell
-   Cells are washed with ethanol solution, which decolorises
    Gram-negative bacteria (but not Gram-positive)Â 
-   Gram-negative cells are visualised by applying safranin â€“ which is
    a pink-coloured counterstain

Gram staining works as a result of the different effects of ethanol on
the cell wall of the bacteria:

-   Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer which is
    dehydrated by ethanol, trapping the crystal violet stain
-   Gram-negative bacteria have an outer lipid membrane which is
    dissolved by ethanol, releasing the crystal violet stain

Both cell types retain the counterstain, but the pink colour cannot be
distinguished in the purple-stained Gram-positive cellsÂ

Â  Â Â 
Microorganisms may be differentiated according to their diverse
morphological and metabolic characteristics:

-   Microorganisms may differ in their cellularÂ organisation â€“ e.g.
    prokaryotes versus eukaryotes
-   Microorganisms may exhibit different nutritional requirements â€“
    e.g. autotrophic versus heterotrophic
-   Their method of respiration may vary according to type â€“ e.g.
    aerobic versus anaerobic respiration
-   They may have different structural characteristics â€“ e.g. shape or
    cell wall composition

Modes of Nutrition

Microorganisms can be categorised according to their mode of nutrition:

-   Photoautotrophs use light energy to synthesise organic molecules
    (e.g. cyanobacteria)
-   Chemoautrophs use energy from chemical oxidation to synthesise
    organic molecules (e.g. nitrogen-fixating bacteria)
-   Heterotrophs obtain organic nutrients via feeding (e.g. amoeba)
-   Saprotrophs release digestive enzymes onto non-living organic matter
    and absorb the products (e.g. fungi)

Nutritional Patterns in Microorganisms

[microorganism nutrition]

Methods of Respiration

Microorganisms can also be categorised according to their mechanism of
respiration:

-   Obligate anaerobes respire anaerobically and can only grow in the
    absence of oxygen
-   Aerotolerant anaerobes respire anaerobically but can grow in the
    presence of oxygen
-   Facultative anaerobes can respire anaerobically or aerobically
    depending on oxygen availability
-   Obligate aerobes only respire aerobically and cannot survive in the

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Pathway engineering optimises genetic and regulatory processes
within microorganisms

â€¢ Â Pathway engineering is used industrially to produce metabolites of
interest

Â  Â Â 
Pathway engineering involves the manipulation of genetic and regulatory
processes to produce metabolites of interest

-   Primary metabolites are compounds that are essential to the growth
    and development of the microorganism (e.g. citric acid)
-   Secondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly involved
    in growth and development (e.g. penicillin)

Pathway engineering optimises metabolic processes to increase yields or
produce exogenous metabolites

-   Yields can be increased byÂ over-expressing genes involved in a
    pathway, or blocking expression of competing pathways
-   New products can be produced by inserting genes of interest (e.g.
    enzymes) into established metabolic processes

As a cell requires certain metabolic pathways for survival, increases in
yields must be balanced against survival requirements

Types of Eubacteria

All bacteria share features common to every prokaryotic cell:

-   They lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles
-   They have circular DNA that is naked (not bound to protein)
-   They have smaller ribosomes (70S)

However different types of bacteria can be distinguished according to a
number of characteristics:

-   ShapeÂ â€“ Round (coccus), rod-like (bacillus), comma-shaped
    (vibrio) or spiral (spirilla / spirochete)
-   Cell wall compositionÂ â€“ Gram-positive (thick peptidoglycan layer)
    or Gram-negative (lipopolysaccharide layer)
-   Gaseous requirementsÂ â€“ Anaerobic (obligate or facultative) or
    aerobic

    chemosynthetic) or heterotrophic

Edible Vaccines

Edible vaccines are food products that contain antigenic fragments of
specific pathogens, evoking immunity in the consumer

-   Antigenic determinants for a specific pathogen are introduced into
    plant tissue (e.g. via Agrobacterium tumefaciens vectors)
-   The transgenic tissues are selected and cultured to produce new
    plants that produce the antigenic fragments
-   When consumed, the body will respond to the presence of the antigens
    by producing specific memory cells
-   These memory cells will safeguard the body against future infection
    from the pathogen (immunity)

Edible vaccines are not currently as effective as normal vaccines as
they are consumed and not injected into the blood

-   In order to elicit an immune response, the fragments must survive
    the digestive process and be absorbed into the blood

with the use of glyphosate-tolerant soybeans

-   These include the impact of tillage, effects on biodiversity and the
    potential for unintended transfer of glyphosate resistance

Impact of Tillage

-   Spraying crops with glyphosate reduces the need for tillage, which
    removes topsoil and increases soil erosion
-   Reducing the amount of tillage will also reduce the associated use
    of fossil fuels, limiting the impact of pollution

Effects on Biodiversity

-   Glyphosate has very low levels of toxicity in animal species and so
    is unlikely to impact population numbers in an ecosystem
-   It is also rapidly degraded by soil microbes and so is unlikely to
    accumulate to dangerous levels within the environment
-   However, the effect of sublethal exposure glysophate has not been
    well studied in most plant and animal models
-   The removal of native weed species by glysophate treatment could
    also adversely effect food chains â€“ reducing biodiversity

Cross Contamination

-   Glyphosate tolerance can potentially be transferred to native
    species â€“ producing weeds that are resistant to the herbicide
-   This impact can be reduced by targeting the resistance gene to
    chlorophyll â€“ preventing its spread in pollen granules
-   Several species of glyphosate-resistant weeds have already been
    identified in the wild

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recombinant DNA can be introduced by direct physical or chemical
methods or indirectly by vectors

Â  Â Â 
Gene delivery is the process of introducing foreign DNA into host cells
for the purpose of genetic modification

-   This delivery may occur directly via physical or chemical methods or
    indirectly via the use of vectors

Physical Delivery

-   Electroporation â€“ An electric charge is applied to cells, which
    permeabilises the membrane so that DNA can enter the cell
-   Microinjection â€“ A fine needle is used to directly inject the
    recombinant DNA into a single host cell
-   Biolistics â€“ Recombinant DNA is coated onto gold particles and
    fired into tissues by a biolistic device (â€˜gene gunâ€™)

Chemical Delivery

-   Calcium chloride â€“ Cells are treated in a calcium chloride
    solution prior to a heat shock (which permeabilises the membrane)Â 
-   Liposomes â€“ Recombinant DNA is stored within a lipid bilayer
    vesicle (liposome), which fuses with the cell via endocytosis

Vector Delivery

-   Agrobacterium tumefaciens â€“ A rod-shaped bacterium that can insert
    a recombinant plasmid into a host cell
-   Tobacco mosaic virus â€“ A retrovirus that can insert genetic
    material into host cells (primarily tobacco plants)

Methods of Gene Delivery

[gene delivery systems]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recombinant DNA can be introduced into whole plants, leaf discs or
protoplasts

Â  Â Â 
Recombinant DNA can be introduced into whole plants, leaf discs or
protoplasts (plant cells with the cell wall removed)

-   Introducing DNA into whole plants can allow for the targeted
    recombination of particular plant tissues
-   Recombinant leaf discs can be regenerated under laboratory
    conditions to form new transgenic plants
-   Protoplasts may take up DNA more easily (due to the absence of a
    cell wall) and can be regenerated into whole plants

When regenerating whole plants, groups of plant cells form a growing
mass (callus) from which plant structures develop

-   Gene delivery systems may be more or less effective depending on the
    target (whole plant, leaf disc or protoplast)

Plant Transgenesis Techniques

[plant transgenesis]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recombinant DNA must be inserted into the plant cell and taken up
by its chromosome or chloroplast DNAÂ 

Â  Â Â 
When recombinant DNA is inserted into a plant cell, it is either taken
up into a chromosome or into chloroplast DNA

-   Alternatively, the recombinant DNA may remain as an independent
    construct within the cell (i.e. in an autonomous plasmid)

Integrating the target gene into chloroplast DNA offers certain
advantages when developing genetically modified crops

-   Genes found inÂ chloroplast DNA will not be present in pollen
    produced by transgenic plants (no chloroplasts in pollen grains)
-   This means the target gene cannot be accidentally released into wild
    plants via cross-pollination

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Marker genes are used to indicate successful uptake

Â  Â Â 
Following gene delivery, scientists must identify which cells have
successfully taken up the recombinant DNA

-   These transgenic cells can then be cultured and developed to form
    transgenic crops for agricultural use

Marker genes are typically included as part of the recombinant construct
to indicate successful uptake

-   Most commonly, marker genes will code for resistance to a particular
    antibiotic
-   Plant cells are grown on media containing the antibiotic and only
    the transgenic cells will be able to surviveÂ

Gene Identification

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Bioinformatics plays a role in identifying target genes

â€¢ Â An open reading frame is a significant length of DNA from a start
codon to a stop codon

Â  Â Â 
Target genes can be identified by searching online databases for long
stretches of DNA that could potentially code for protein

-   These sequences â€“ called open reading frames (ORF) â€“ will be
    preceded by a start codon and uninterrupted by stop codons
-   Open reading frames will typically consist of at least 100 codons
    (300 nucleotides)
-   Searches can be refined by looking at regions downstream of known
    promoter sequences and upstream of termination sites

While open reading frames may predict potential coding regions, they do
not automatically guarantee the presence of a gene

-   Some long and uninterrupted sequences DNA may not actually be
    translated, whilst other short sequences may code protein

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of an open reading frame

Â  Â Â 
Any particular stretch of DNA will have six reading frames that could
potentially code for a functional protein

-   mRNA is translated in codons (triplets of bases), meaning there are
    three potential reading frames for a given DNA sequence
-   DNA is double stranded and either strand could include a gene,
    meaning there are six reading frames in total (2Â Ã— 3)

To identify an open reading frame:

-   Locate a sequence corresponding to a start codon in order to
    determine the reading frame â€“ this will be ATG (sense strand)
-   Read this sequence in base triplets until a stop codon is reached
    (TGA, TAG or TAA)
-   The longer the sequence, the more significant the likelihood that
    the sequence corresponds to an open reading frame

Certain bioinformatic programs can automatically identify potential ORFs
when provided with a candidate sequence

-   Gene sequences are largely conserved â€“ so if an ORF sequence is
    present in multiple genomes, it likely represents a gene

Identification of an Open Reading Frame

[open reading frame]

Link: Â ORF Finder

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The target gene is linked to other sequences that control its
expression

Â  Â Â 
The expression of a gene is controlled by other additional sequences
that regulate transcriptional activity

-   A core promoter sequence functions as an initiation site where a
    complex of transcription factors are assembled
-   Control elements may serve to regulate the rate of transcription â€“
    either increasing (enhancers) or decreasing (silencers)

When a target gene is selected, it is linked to these other sequences to
form a recombinant construct capable of expression

-   Including a promoter sequence as part of the construct will ensure
    the autonomous expression of the target gene
-   Control elements may be included within the construct to allow
    scientists to determine the rate and timing of expression

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to introduce
glyphosate resistance into soybean crops

Â  Â Â 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a pathogenic bacteria that induces tumors
(called crown galls) in certain species of plant

-   The bacterium inserts aÂ tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid into plant
    cells, which then integrates its DNA into the plant genome

Scientists have used Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a vector to introduce
glyphosate resistance into soybean crops

-   Glyphosate is a herbicide that competitively inhibits a plant enzyme
    (EPSPS) responsible for the synthesis of amino acids
-   Scientists have modified the Ti plasmid to include a gene coding for
    glyphosate resistance
-   When soybean crops are infected with transgenic Agrobacterium
    tumefaciens, a glyphosate-resistant crown gall develops
-   When the gall tissue is later cultured into independent plants, all
    cultured plants will carry the gene for glyphosate resistance
-   This means farmers can spray glyphosate on crops to kill competing
    weeds without harming the transgenic soybean plants

Application:

â€¢ Â Genetic modification of tobacco mosaic virus to allow bulk
production of hepatitis B vaccine in tobacco plants

Â  Â Â 
Hepatitis B is a liver disease in humans caused by a virus (HBV)â€“
however infection can be prevented by vaccination

-   Vaccination involves introducing antigenic fragments to the immune
    system in order to develop specific memory cells

The tobacco mosaic virus infects the tissue of tobacco plants and
incorporates its viral genetic material into the plant genome

-   The tobacco mosaic virus can be genetically engineered to include
    genes encoding the antigenic fragments of HBV
-   Transgenic tobacco plants will produce the HBV antigens, which can
    be extracted and purified to produce a vaccine in bulk

Bulk Production of Hepatitis B Vaccine in Tobacco Plants

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Production of Amflora potato (SolanumÂ tuberosum) for paper and
adhesive industries

Â  Â Â 
Potatoes contain two forms of starch â€“ a branched form (amylopectin =
80%) and an unbranched form (amylose = 20%)

-   Amylopectin is responsible for the useful industrial properties of
    starch (adhesives, textiles, paper, etc.)
-   Amylose forms a gel which makes potato starch less stable and more
    difficult to use for industrial purposes

Amflora potatoes have been genetically modified to only produce
amylopectin by inhibiting the amylose-producing enzyme

-   Amflora potatoes possess an antisense copy of the gene responsible
    for amylose production
-   This antisense gene synthesises a complementary mRNA sequence that
    binds to the normal mRNA sequence
-   Consequently, the gene responsible for amylose production is not
    translated and the potato only produces amylopectin

-   Genetically modified animals may be used to grow human transplant
    tissues and organs (xenotransplantation)

-   The introduced genes code for novel proteins that were not
    previously part of the speciesâ€™ proteome

The process of genetically engineering a transgenic organism typically
involves three key stages:

-   The gene of interest must first be identified and isolated
-   The gene must be delivered into the cells of the appropriate host
    organism
-   The transgenic cells must be selected for according to successful

resistance to increase crop yields

â€¢ Â Genetically modified crop plants can be used to produce novel
products

Â  Â Â 
Genetic modification can be used in agriculture to overcome unfavourable
environmental factors and increase crop yield

-   Tolerance genes can be introduced into plants to provide resistance
    to herbicides
-   Genes from xerophytes or halophytes can be introduced into crops to
    allow them to grow in dry soil or saline conditions
-   Resistance to particular viral diseases or pathogenic infections can
    be introduced into crop plants

Crops can also be genetically modified to produce novel products that
may benefit the consumer

-   The introduction of genes may improve the nutritional value of the
    crop (e.g. Golden rice produces more beta-carotene)
-   Modified crops may produce toxins to pest species, obviating the
    need for insecticides (e.g. Bt corn is toxic to the corn borer)
-   Crops are being created that possess the antigenic fragments of
    specific pathogens, thus functioning as edible vaccines

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Bacteriophages are used in the disinfection of water systems

Â  Â Â 
Biofilms will often form within the pipes of water systems â€“
contaminating the supply, clogging the pipe and causing corrosion

-   The biofilms are difficult to remove using disinfectants and
    antimicrobial drugs, as they are highly resistant to these agents

Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically target bacteria, and are
commonly used in the disinfection of water systems

-   Bacteriophages may quickly spread through all bacterial cells and
    disrupt the coordinated maintenance of the biofilm
-   The virus will propagate within the bacterial cell and cause it to
    lyse as part of its viral life cycle

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cooperative aggregates of microorganisms can form biofilms

â€¢ Â Microorganisms in biofilms cooperate through quorum sensing

Â  Â Â 
Biofilm Formation

A biofilm is a cooperativeÂ aggregate of microorganisms associated with
a surface and enclosed in a polymeric matrix (â€˜slimeâ€™)

-   Biofilms can form on solid and liquid surfaces and may be composed
    of a single species or many species of microorganism

Biofilm formation begins with the attachment of microorganisms to a
surface through weak, reversibleÂ associations

-   If not removed, the microorganisms form more permanent, irreversible
    attachments using adhesion structures (such as pili)
-   The cells forming a monolayer will grow and divide, before producing
    an exopolymer matrix to enclose the developing colony

Biofilm Development

[biofilm formation]

Quorum Sensing

As the biofilm develops, microorganisms will alter their gene expression
in response to changes in population density

-   This pattern of behaviour is called quorum sensing and is mediated
    by the release of chemicals from colony cells
-   Individual cells release inducer chemicals that will trigger
    specific transcriptional changes when a threshold is surpassed
-   As cells begin to aggregate, the concentration of inducer chemicals
    increases to exceed the required threshold
-   This triggers a synchronised change in gene expression, allowing the
    biofilm to operate as a coordinated system

Quorum sensing allows the biofilm to grow and develop in a manner that
is not uniform and promotes structural stability

-   Channels will form in order to facilitate the spread and
    incorporation of nutrients throughout the biofilm
-   Metabolic activity can create changes in the microenvironment,
    prompting the differential distribution of microorganisms
    -   For example, the establishment of an oxygen gradient will
        differentially localise aerobic and anaerobic metabolisers

Example of Quorum Sensing â€“ Bioluminescence (VibrioÂ fischeri)

[quorum sensing]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Biofilms possess emergent properties

â€¢ Â Microorganisms growing in a biofilm are highly resistant to
antimicrobial agents

Â  Â Â 
Emergent Properties

Through quorum sensing, microorganisms in a biofilm possess functions
beyond those that are present in an individual cell

-   The cooperative action of cells in the biofilm combine to create new
    synergistic effects (emergent properties)

One emergent property commonly identified in biofilms is an increased
resistance to antimicrobial agents

-   Within a biofilm, some microorganisms develop into non-dividing,
    slow-growing persister cells
-   These cells exist within a physiologically dormant state, which
    makes them insensitive to the action of antimicrobial drugs
-   Consequently, these cells survive antimicrobial treatments and
    function as a reserve from which the biofilm can repopulate
-   This renders antimicrobial drugs ineffective in the treatment of
    biofilms and associated diseasesÂ

Environmental Problems

Biofilms are ubiquitous in nature and will form on virtually any
non-shedding surface in a moist environment

-   Biofilms in streams form an important component of aquatic food
    chains and also filter sediments to maintain water quality
-   Microbial biofilms are actively involved in the decomposition of
    biotic debris and the recycling of nutrients
-   Biofilms may form on plant surfaces to form symbiotic relationships
    with the plant (e.g. nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots)
-   Alternatively, biofilms may form on plant surfaces to cause crop
    diseases (e.g. citrus canker is associated with biofilms)
-   Biofilms are present on the surface of animals (e.g. dental plaque
    on teeth) and may cause diseases when present internally
-   Biofilms can form on man-made structures such as faucets and sewage
    pipes, resulting in long-term corrosion
-   Biofilm adhesion to ship hulls serves as the foundation for
    biofouling on marine vessels
-   Biofilms can also serve constructive purposes, including in food
    preparation, bioremediation and sewage treatment

Biomagnification

Because energy transformations are only ~10% efficient, higher trophic
levels must consume more prey to meet energy needs

If a pollutant is ingested by living organisms, it will become
concentrated at higher trophic levels as they eat more exposed prey

-   The increase of a substance (such as a pollutant) in a particular
    organisms is calledÂ bioaccumulation
-   The increase in the concentration of a substance at a particular
    trophic level is calledÂ biomagnification

BioaccumulationÂ refers to how pollutants enter a food chain,
whereasÂ biomagnificationÂ refers to the tendency of pollutants to
concentrate as they move from one trophic level to the next
Because pollutants become concentrated by biomagnification, higher
trophic levels are more susceptible to their toxic effects

-   The pesticide DDT caused egg-shell thinning and population declines
    in species of birds that fed on exposed insectsÂ 
-   Heavy metals (like mercury) released into waterways via industrial
    processes may become concentrated in fish

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Responses to pollution incidents can involve bioremediation
combined with physical and chemical procedures

â€¢ Â Microorganisms are used in bioremediation

Â  Â Â 
Pollution involves the release of harmful contaminants into the natural
environment, causing ecological disruption

-   Responses to pollution incidents can involve bioremediation combined
    with physical and chemical procedures

Bioremediation is the process by whichÂ microorganisms are used to
return a polluted environment to its natural state

-   Microorganisms may produce specific enzymes and undergo certain
    chemical processes that can break down contaminants

Bioremediation is often supported by physical and chemical procedures
that help filter the contaminant out of the environment

-   Physical: Â Detergents and dispersal agents may be deployed on oil
    spills to prevent the contaminants from aggregating
-   Chemical: Â Contaminants can alternatively be burnt, removed by
    dissolving or destroyed by chemical oxidation

Bioremediation of an Oil Spill

Eutrophication

Eutrophication is the enrichment of an ecosystem (typically aquatic)
with chemical nutrients (nitrates, phosphates, etc.)

-   The nutrients can be introduced via leaching from soil by rainfall
    or released as part of sewage
-   Eutrophication is common around agricultural lands where the use
    ofÂ artificial fertilisers are prevalent

An increase in nutrient supply within waterways will result in several
ecological consequences:

-   A rapid growth in algal populations will occur (algal blooms) as a
    result of the increased availability of nutrients
-   As the algae die, there will be a subsequent spike in the numbers of
    saprotrophic microbes (decomposers)
-   The high rate of decomposition will result in an increased
    biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) by saprotrophic bacteria
-   The saprotrophs will consume available quantities of dissolved
    oxygen, leading to deoxygenation of the water supply
-   Eutrophication will also increase the turbidity of the water, which
    will reduce oxygen production by photosynthetic seaweeds
-   This will stress the survival of marine organisms, potentially
    leading to a reduction in biodiversity within the ecosystem

Plastic Pollution

Plastics are a type of synthetic polymer found in certain types of
clothes, bottles, bags, food wrappings and containers

-   Most plastics are not biodegradable and persist in the environment
    for many centuries (bioremediation is not effective)

Large visible plastic debris (> 1 mm) is defined asÂ macroplastic, while
smaller debris (< 1 mm) is defined asÂ microplastic

-   Macroplastic debris can be degraded and broken down into
    microplastic debris by UV radiation and the action of waves
-   Ocean currents will concentrate plastic debris in large oceanic
    convergence zones calledÂ gyres

Plastic debris will leach chemicals into the water and also absorb toxic
contaminants called persistent organic pollutants

-   Microplastics will absorb more persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
    due to their smaller size (more available surface area)

Both macroplastic and microplastic debris is ingested by marine animals,
which mistake the debris for food

-   This leads to the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of persistent
    organic pollutants within marine animals
-   It may also damage the stomach of animals or cause them to stop
    feeding (by taking up space in the digestive tract)

Â  Â Â 
A pollutant is a substance introduced into the environment that has an
adverse effect upon a natural resource

-   Certain pollutants may be disintegrated via the biological
    metabolism of microorganisms (biodegradation)

Examples of pollutants that may be metabolised by microorganisms
include:

-   Oil: Â Hydrocarbons in crude oil may be metabolised by Pseudomonas
-   Benzene: Â Aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene) may be metabolised
    by halophilic Marinobacter
-   Mercury: Â Toxic methyl mercury may be converted into environmental
    mercury by Pseudomonas

Application:

â€¢ Â Degradation of oil by Pseudomonas

â€¢ Â Degradation of benzene by halophilic bacteria such as Marinobacter

Â  Â Â 
Oil Spills

Crude oil is a non-uniform material composed of a mixture of
hydrocarbons in variable proportions

-   It can be processed to form petroleum products that can be refined
    to form various types of fuels (e.g. gasoline, etc.)
-   When crude oil is released from containment (i.e. via damaged
    tankers or pipelines), it will form a floating slick on water

Crude oil is biodegradable and hence oil spills are commonly dispersed
by bacterial decomposition (bioremediation)

-   Physical procedures (such as the surface pumping of an oil slick)
    are highly laborious, expensive and slow
-   Chemical procedures (such as the use of dispersants) may be
    non-biodegradable and toxic to marine ecosystemsÂ 

Pseudomonas is a chemoheterotroph that can utilise crude oil as its sole
carbon source, making it efficient at oil degradation

-   The hydrocarbons within the oil are converted into biomass or broken
    down via respiration into carbon dioxide and water
-   Spraying the oil with essential inorganic nutrients (e.g. nitrates,
    phosphates, etc.) assists in the conversion to biomass
-   The efficiency of oil degradation can also be improved by the
    presence of a surfactant (helps distribute the bacteria)

A high presence of salt at an oil spill may inhibit bacterial species
(such asÂ Pseudomonas) from being able to degrade the oil

-   Oil spills commonly occur in marine environments â€“ oil is
    frequently extracted in off-shore locations and transported by ship
-   Additionally, the extraction of oil from underground reserviors is
    oftenÂ accompanied by brine (salt water)

Marinobacter are a halophilic ('salt-lovingâ€™) bacteria that can
degrade certain hydrocarbons present in crude oil (i.e. benzene)

-   Whilst not as efficient at degrading oil as Pseudomonas, its
    tolerance for salt environments makes it a useful alternative

Application:

â€¢ Â Conversion by Pseudomonas of methyl mercury into elemental mercury

Â  Â Â 
Mercury Contamination

Mercury exists in three forms: as a metal (elemental mercury), as
inorganic ions or as an organic form (methyl mercury)

-   Elemental mercury is produced as an industrial pollutant and is
    converted to the other forms by aquatic bacterial communities

Methyl mercury is the most toxic form and will accumulate within aquatic
ecosystems polluted by elemental mercury

-   Pseudomonas is capable of degrading the toxic methyl mercury to form
    elemental mercury and methane gas
-   This makes Pseudomonas an important biological agent in the
    treatment and remediation of mercury pollution

Â  Â Â 
Sewage is the fluid waste of human communities and is rich in organic
matter that can be broken down by microorganisms

-   Solids are anaerobically digested by saprotrophic microorganisms,
    while liquid effluent is cleaned by aerobic metabolism

The aerobic conditions required for the saprotrophic decomposition of
liquid effluent can be maintained by trickle filter beds

-   Trickling filter systems continually recirculate the effluent by
    spraying it over a bed of stones to maintain dissolved O₂ levels
-   A biofilm of saprotrophic bacteria is situated in the stone bed and
    feed on the organic matter within the sewage
-   Clean water filters out the bottom into another tank, whereby
    bacteria are removed and water is further treated (chlorination)

Â  Â  Â Â 
Biopharming involves using transgenic plants or animals to produce
(orÂ â€˜farmâ€™) pharmaceutical products for therapeutic use

-   This involves the insertion of target genes into hosts (crops or
    animals) that would not normally express those genes
-   The desired compound can potentially be expressed in a form that is
    routinely harvested (e.g. milk, eggs, fruits, etc.)

There are several established examples of biopharming, including:

-   Transgenic sheep that produce humanÂ Î±-1-antitrypsin in their milk
    (individuals deficient in this enzyme develop emphysema)
-   Crops that express attenuated antigenic fragments for specific
    pathogenic diseases (i.e. edible vaccines)Â

Application:

â€¢ Â Biopharming of antithrombin

Â  Â  Â Â 
Antithrombin is a blood protein which inactivates certain enzymes in the
coagulation system to prevent excessive clotting

-   Individuals with a genetic or acquired antithrombin deficiency are
    at an increased risk of developing damaging blood clots

Genetically engineered antithrombin has been biopharmed from transgenic
goats to produce stocks for commercial use

-   A human gene encoding for antithrombin is introduced into the
    fertilised egg of a goat
-   The modified eggs are implanted into the uterus of surrogates, which
    give birth to transgenic offspring
-   The transgenic offspring will produce human antithrombin in its
    milk, which can then be extracted and purified
-   Each year, the transgenic goat can produce a quantity of
    antithrombin equivalent to 90,000 human blood donations

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Infections by a pathogen can be detected by the presence of its
genetic material or by its antigens

Â  Â Â 
Surface Markers

Pathogenic infections by microorganisms can be detected by the presence
of specific markers on the cellâ€™s surface

-   These foreign markers which are capable of eliciting an immune
    response are called antigens
-   The part of the antigen to whichÂ specificÂ antibodies will bind is
    called an epitope (or antigenic determinant)

Specific infections can be identified by determining which antigens are
present to form a complex with specific antibodies

-   Infectious pathogens may possess multiple different antigens, with
    each antigen potentially possessing multiple epitopes
-   The presence of particular antigens can be detected by undertaking
    an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

â€¢ Â Predisposition to a genetic disease can be detected through the
presence of markers

Â  Â Â 
Genetic Markers

Certain genes may predispose individuals to particular disease
conditions (e.g. BRCA genes predispose to breast cancer)

-   Screening an individualâ€™s genome for certain genetic sequences
    allows for the identification of disease predispositions

Genetic markers can be detected using gene probes â€“ nucleotide
sequences that are complexed to fluorescent labels

-   The gene probe is complementary to specific target sequences and
    will hybridise and fluoresce if that sequence is present
-   A large variety of genetic markers can be tested for using DNA
    microarrays (also commonly known as DNA chips / biochips)

In addition to testing for genetic diseases, gene probes can also be
used to identify pathogenic genetic material

-   Pathogens will have unique genetic sequences which, if detected by a
    gene probe, will indicate infection has occurred
-   Pathogenic genetic material can be amplified and identified using
    modified PCR techniques

Metabolic Markers

A disease is an abnormal condition of the body that impairs normal
functioning (i.e. deviation from homeostasis)

-   Diseased cells will have an altered metabolism and may synthesise
    products that are not present in normal, healthy cells
-   These metabolic products (metabolites) may be detected in blood or
    urine to enable identification of disease conditions
-   Disease metabolites may be detected with monoclonal antibodies using
    an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA microarrays can be used to test for genetic predisposition or
to diagnose the disease

Â  Â Â 
Individuals can be screened for genetic diseases and cancers by using
cDNA and microarrays

-   This technology can also be used to investigate the protein
    expression pathways that lead to these conditions

cDNA

Complementary DNA (cDNA) is a molecule synthesised from an mRNA template
via reverse transcription

-   cDNA molecules represent gene sequences that areÂ actively
    transcribedÂ by a cell (as they were synthesised from mRNA)Â 
-   This makes them a valuable tool for determining expression patterns
    of proteins in normal and diseased states

Microarray

A DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA sequences (oligos)
attached to a solid surface

-   These sequences represent fractions of a large library of genes that
    are present in a cell
-   If a gene is active within a cell, then the cDNA (produced from the
    mRNA transcript) will bind to its complementary oligo
-   If the cDNA has been fluorescently labeled, then the complementary
    oligo can be identifiedÂ 
-   Each oligo represents a known gene sequence, so genetic diseases are
    identified according to whichÂ oligos are hybridised
-   The greater the expression of a particular gene, the brighter the
    fluorescence seen in the relevant microarray well

In addition to diagnosing genetic diseases, microarrays can also be used
to identify new genes that cause disease conditions

-   If cDNA from healthy and diseased cells are labeled with different
    fluorophores, comparisons of gene expression can be made
-   Genes that areÂ onlyÂ active in a diseased or normal state will be
    of particular interest to scientists

DNA Microarray Overview

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of a simple microarray

Â  Â Â 
When microarrays are used to compare mRNA expression in healthy and
diseased cells, the following conventions are used:

-   cDNA from healthy cells are typically tagged with green
    fluorescence, while cDNA from diseased cells are tagged with red
-   This enables identification of genes present only in healthy cells
    (green), diseased cells (red), both (yellow) or neither (none)

â€¢ Â Interpretation of the results of an ELISA diagnostic test

Â  Â  Â Â 
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a test that uses enzymes
and colour changes to identify a substance

-   It can be used to identify specific surface markers or metabolites
    associated with particular diseases

Different variations of the ELISA test exist, but one of the most common
protocols involves the sandwich method:

-   Known monoclonal antibodies are affixed to wells in a plate (these
    are the 'capture antibodies')
-   A sample to be tested is added to the wells and any antigens present
    will bind to the appropriate capture antibody
-   The plates are then washed to remove any unbound antigen
-   A second set of monoclonal antibodies linked to colour-changing
    enzymes are then added to the wells
-   These 'detection antibodiesâ€™ will bind to any antigens captured,
    creating a sandwich (antibody - antigen - antibody)
-   The wells are then washed again to remove any unbound detection
    antibodies
-   When an appropriate substrate is added to the wells, the
    enzyme-linked detection antibodies will trigger a colour change
-   Only wells in which a sandwich complex has formed will show a colour
    change, hence identifying the presence of an antigen

Summary of the Sandwich ELISA Method

[ELISA]

Interpreting ELISA Tests

ELISA tests can be used to diagnose disease conditions based on the
presence of disease markers (antigens, metabolites)

-   Samples taken from infected patients will induce a colour change
    when treated with appropriate detection antibodies
-   The amount of colour change can be used to signify rate of disease
    progression (more marker = more colour change)Â

Gene Editing

Gene editing involves the insertion, removal or replacement of DNA
within the genome of a living organism

-   The most precise, efficient and flexible method of gene editing
    currently available involves the CRISPR editing system

CRISPR is a short sequence of DNA which functions as a target for
CRISPR-associated nucleases (Cas nuclease)

-   CRISPR stands forÂ â€˜clustered regularly interspaced short
    palindromic repeatsâ€™
-   CRISPR provides bacterial immunity to viruses by flanking viral DNA
    sequences that have been integrated into the genome
-   The viral DNA isÂ transcribedÂ into an RNA sequence that â€“ via
    CRISPR â€“ associates with a Cas nuclease
-   The viral RNA andÂ Cas nuclease drift throughout the cell until the
    viral RNA identifies and binds to complementary viral DNA
-   This enables the Cas nuclease to target and destroy the viral DNA
    sequence, preventing infection

The CRISPR / Cas system has been modified to selectively remove any
targeted sequence, allowing for precise gene editing

-   TheÂ Cas protein is complexed with a synthetically derived guide RNA
    molecule that is complementary to a target sequence
-   The guide RNA will bind to the target sequence, prompting its
    excision by the Cas nuclease
-   Following the removal of the target sequence, another sequence of
    DNA can be integrated in its place (gene editing)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Viral vectors can be used in gene therapy

Â  Â  Â Â 
Gene therapyÂ is the insertion of genes into an individualâ€™s cells to
treat hereditary diseases by replacing defective alleles

-   It differs from standard transgenic practices in that it is intended
    to transform existing organisms rather than create new ones
-   Viral vectors are typically used, due to their ability to integrate
    DNA into the hostâ€™s genome
-   The process involves removing cells from a patient and using a viral
    vector to introduce aÂ functional copy of the defective gene
-   When the cells are transplanted back into the patient, they should
    begin expressing the missing protein to restore normal healthÂ 

Overview of Gene Therapy

[gene therapy]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of viral vectors in the treatment of Severe Combined
Immunodeficiency (SCID)

Â  Â  Â Â 
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder caused by
the absence of functional T lymphocytes

-   This impairs the adaptive immune system and prevents antibody
    production, resulting in a deficient immune response
-   Individuals with SCID are unable to respond to trivial infections
    and opportunistic infections can prove to be fatal

SCID is commonly caused by an autosomal recessive condition known as
adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency

-   This condition results from an inability to produce the enzyme ADA,
    which is needed to safely break down a toxic chemical
-   Immature lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to this toxic
    chemical and consequently fail to mature (leading to SCID)
-   Individuals who have undergone gene therapy have shown steady
    increases in cellular ADA levels following the procedure

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of PCR to detect different strains of influenza virus

Â  Â  Â Â 
Influenza is caused by an RNA virus that can rapidly mutate to exist as
distinctive serotypes (i.e. different strains exist)

-   These strains will have different glycoprotein antigens and hence
    engender different antibody responses
-   Identifying the specific strain of influenza virus in an infected
    individual will help in the selection of optimal drug treatments

Different strains of influenza can be detected using a modified PCR
protocol

-   Amplification of the virus requires the conversion of its RNA
    sequences into cDNA (reverse transcription via RT-PCR)
-   Because several different strains of the influenza virus exist,
    appropriate primers need to be selected to reflect this range

Specific strains of influenza virus can be detected using molecular
beacons that target sequences unique to a given strain

-   A molecular beacon is a hairpin-shaped nucleotide sequence with an
    internally quenched fluorophore molecule
-   When the beacon anneals to a complementary target sequence, the
    hairpin unfolds and fluorescence is restored
-   Hence, different strains of influenza virus can be detected
    following RT-PCR amplification according to fluorescence

Pharmacogenomics

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how an individualâ€™s genes affect
their response to drugs

-   All individuals have a unique genetic profile and hence will
    metabolise pharmaceutical compounds differently
-   This will determine how effective a particular drug is at treating a
    disease condition, as well as the dosage required

Pharmacogenomics is used to develop optimal drug therapies that take
into account an individualâ€™s genotype

-   Drugs are chosen to ensure maximum efficiency with minimal side
    effects
-   Through pharmocogenomics, different patients may be prescribed
    different medications for the same disease condition

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Tracking experiments are used to gain information about the
localization and interaction of a desired protein

Â  Â  Â Â 
If a protein is labelled to enable detection, its subsequent movements
can be tracked to gain information about its function

-   Tracking protein locations can provide information about cellular
    and subcellular targets for protein activity
-   Tracking protein interactions can provide information about reaction
    pathways with which the protein is involved

Proteins can be tracked by tagging with a fluorescent molecule to enable
detection with appropriate imaging devices

-   Consideration must be given as to whether forming a fluorescent
    complex will impair its ability to interact with targets

Alternatively, proteins can be tracked by incorporating radioactively
labelled amino acids into its structure

-   This is called a pulse-chase experiment, as the protein is
    radiolabelled (â€˜pulseâ€™) to enable its temporary detection
    (â€˜chaseâ€™)

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Tracking tumour cells using transferrin linked to luminescent
probes

Â  Â  Â Â 
Transferrins are protein molecules that transport iron within the blood
plasma

-   Transferrin facilitates iron uptake into target cells by binding to
    specific transferrin receptors, which mediate endocytosis

The expression of transferrin receptors is significantly upregulated in
tumour cells (i.e. they have a lot more of them)

-   This means that transferrins will bind more frequently to tumour
    cells as they have more transferrin receptors
-   If transferrin is linked to a luminescent probe, tumour cells will
    therefore show greater luminescence

Transferrin Receptor Upregulation in Tumour Cells

[transferrin]

Tumour Tracking

Because tumour cells will luminesce more brightly, transferrin-linked
luminescent probes can be used to locate tumours

-   This can be useful in determining the rates of cancer progression in
    test animals â€“ which is helpful in developing treatments
-   It can also be used to determine the extent of spread of a cancer
    should it metastasise to another tissue

Locating Tumours with Luminescent Probes

[tumor tracking]
Yeast-2-Hybrid System

The yeast-2-hybrid system is a simple scientific technique used to
screen a library of proteins for potential interactions

-   Firstly, a transcription factor is broken into two parts â€“ a
    DNA-binding domain (BD) and a catalytic activation domain (AD)
-   The DNA-binding domain is fused to a protein of interest called
    theÂ baitÂ (e.g. an enzyme)
-   The activation domain is fused to a number of potential binding
    partners â€“ called theÂ preyÂ (e.g. different ligands)
-   If the bait and prey interact, the two parts of the transcription
    factor are reconstituted and activate transcription of a gene
-   If the bait and prey do not interact, the two parts of the
    transcription factor remain separate and transcription doesnâ€™t
    occur

The yeast-2-hybrid system detects protein-protein interactions according
to the activation of a reporter gene

-   The reporter gene may encode for the production of a protein that
    causes a visible colour change (e.g. ÃŸ-galactosidase)
-   Alternatively, the reporter gene may encode for the production of an
    essential amino acid that is required for the yeast to grow on a
    deficient media (hence yeast growth would indicate successful
    interaction between bait and prey)

Yeast-2-hybrid screens are a simple technique and hence have a
relatively high rate of false positives (partial interactions)

-   Consequently, the yeast-2-hybrid system is typically only used as an
    initial test to identify possible protein interactionsÂ

Allele Frequencies

Bioinformatic databases can be used to compare the frequency of a
particular allele across many populations

-   Allele frequencies represent the prevalence of a particular allele
    in a population, as a proportion of all the alleles for that gene
-   Consequently, allele frequencies are either represented as a
    percentage or as a value from 0 to 1.0

Changes in allele frequency can reflect either random processes (genetic
drift) or differential processes (natural selection)

-   Population bottlenecks and the founder effect will exacerbate
    genetic differences between geographically isolated populations

Allele frequencies between populations can be compared using
theÂ AlleleÂ FrequencyÂ Database (ALFRED)

    collate relevant data for interpretation and analysis

The body of available data stored in databases is increasing
exponentially as a result of:

-   Advancements in sequencing protocols (promotes faster data
    collection)Â 
-   Development of new software tools (results in easier access to data

sequences

â€¢ Â Databases can be searched to compare new sequences with sequence

Â  Â Â 
Comparative genomics is a field of bioinformatics in which the genome
sequence of different species is compared

-   Gene sequences are highly conserved and so can be identified by
    matching with known gene sequences in other species
-   Species with close evolutionary relationships typically shareÂ a
    higher degree of gene sequence homology

When an equivalent gene is discovered in another organism, it enables
scientists to use that organism to study gene function

-   There are greater ethical restraints involved in human
    experimentation, so using model organisms is a valid alternative
-   The most useful model organisms will be those with the highest
    degree of sequence similarity (e.g. bonobos = > 98%)
-   However, studying less related species may also be viable but
    present less ethical concerns (e.g. mouse = > 80%)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â EST is an expressed sequence tag that can be used to identify
potential genes

Â  Â Â 
One method of identifying conserved genes in different species is via
the use of anÂ expressed sequence tag (EST)

-   An EST is a short sequence of DNA (~200 â€“ 500 nucleotides) that is
    derived from the sequence of an expressed gene
-   An EST is generated by sequencing the terminal region of a cDNA
    construct (cDNA is copied from transcribed mRNA)

The EST is used to find a corresponding geneÂ by finding its matching
sequenceÂ within another organismâ€™s genome

-   The efficacy of this process will be dependent on the genome size
    and occurrence of introns (cDNA does notÂ copy introns)

Alignment of ESTs to Genome

[EST]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Discovery of genes by EST data mining

Â  Â Â 
EST data mining involves searching genome databases for sequences that
are a match to an expressed sequence tag

-   As as EST represents the terminal portion of a gene, an exact
    sequence match may denote a geneâ€™s presence and locationÂ 

EST sequences can be used to establish the function of novel genes:

-   If an EST sequence from a novel gene matches that of a known gene,
    it may indicate common functionality
-   If the EST returns no significant matches within a database, then no
    information can be gleaned regarding gene function

An example of an EST database which can be used for data mining gene
locations and functions is GenBank

    specific tissues within the organism (conditional knockout)

The Cre-LoxP system uses the enzyme Cre recombinase to remove genetic
sequences located between two Lox sites

-   Using recombinant DNA technology, LoxP sequences are inserted on
    either side of a gene of interest in a test animal
-   The Cre gene is inserted next to aÂ tissue-specificÂ promoter in
    another test animal
-   When the two animals are bred, the resulting offspring will possess
    LoxP sequences and a tissue-specific Cre recombinase
-   The Cre recombinase will remove the gene located between the Lox
    sites to create a conditional knockout for further study

Phylogenetics

Previous

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Multiple sequence alignment is used in the study ofÂ phylogenetics

Â  Â Â 
Phylogeny refers to an evolutionary line of descent and can be
determined by comparing sequences in different species

-   Variations in these sequences (either nucleotide or amino acid
    sequences) will occur due to mutations
-   The greater the differences between the sequences, the longer the
    time span since the two species had a common ancestor

Cladograms are tree diagrams where each branch point represents the
splitting of two new groups from a common ancestor

-   Each branch point (node) represents a speciation event by which
    distinct species are formed via divergent evolution
-   In cladograms, the length of each branch is the same â€“ the
    branches do not infer an evolutionary time scale

Phylograms are similar to cladograms, however branch lengths may differ
according to the length of time since speciation

-   Unlike cladograms, phylograms do infer the amount of evolutionary
    time separating two species

Phylogram construction requires comparison of sequences that have a
constant rate of mutation (â€˜evolutionary clocksâ€™)

-   Mitochondrial DNA is a useful source as it is maternally derived,
    has a known mutation rate and lacks recombinationÂ

    collection of DNA sequences
-   Clustal OmegaÂ â€“ an alignment program that compares multiple
    sequences of DNA

[genbank][clustal]

Â  Â 

Constructing Phylogeny Trees

Step 1:Â Â Select a gene or protein common to a range of selected
organisms

-   Examples of molecules which are ubiquitously found in many animals
    include haemoglobin and cytochrome c

Step 2:Â Â Copy the molecular sequence (DNA or amino acid) for each of
the selected organisms

-   Use the GenBank database to identify relevant DNA or amino acid
    sequences
-   Sequences can be collated in a Word document and then saved as a
    document in plain text format (.txt)Â 
-   Before each sequence, designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)

Step 3:Â Â Run a multiple alignment and generate a phylogeny tree
(cladogram)

-   Use Clustal Omega align multiple DNA or amino acid sequences for
    comparison
-   Clustal Omega can generate branched phylograms after a sequence
    alignment is completed (selectÂ â€˜Phylogenetic Treeâ€™)

Example: Â Upload the following plain text files to compare nucleotide
and amino acid sequences from different species:

-   CHRNEÂ Â â€“ Â Cholinergic receptor epsilon (nicotinic) for various
    species (nucleotide sequence)
-   HBAÂ Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin alpha chain from various speciesÂ (amino
    acid sequence)
RNA Interference

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is
roughly 20 â€“ 25 base pairs in length

siRNA interferes with the expression of genes by causing the mRNA
transcripts to be broken prior to translation

-   Â When theÂ siRNA is unwound, one strand (the passenger strand) is
    degraded and one strand (the guide strand) remains
-   The guide strand will hybridise to its complementary mRNA sequence
    and recruit a protein complex called RISC
-   RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) will then destroy the targeted
    mRNA, preventing translation of the associated gene

show the degree of similarity between them

-   This is called a sequence alignment and is commonly used to show the
    degree of relatedness between sequences
-   Protein sequences usually show more similarities than nucleotide
    sequences because of the degeneracy of the genetic code
    -   I.e. Some codons code for the same amino acid, so different
        nucleotide sequences can code the same protein sequence

Multiple Alignment of a Protein Sequence from Various Species

[multiple alignment]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of software to align two proteins

Â  Â Â 
Clustal Omega is a free online tool that will align nuclotide or amino
acid sequences for comparison

-   It can compare multiple (more than two) sequences at once
-   Sequence consensus can be colour coded in a Jalview applet found
    underÂ â€˜Result Summaryâ€™ (requires Java)

To construct a multiple alignment:

-   Change the input sequence type to the relevant form (DNA, RNA or
    protein)
-   Paste the relevant sequences into the provided space
-   Before each sequence designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)
-   Alternatively, sequences can be saved as a document in plain text
    format (.txt) and then uploaded
-   When all sequences have been included, clickÂ â€˜Submitâ€™Â (under
    step 3)

Below are plain text files that contain nucleotide and amino acid
sequences for multiple alignment:

-   CHRNEÂ Â â€“ Â Cholinergic receptor epsilon (nicotinic) for various
    species (nucleotide sequence)
-   HBAÂ Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin alpha chain from various speciesÂ (amino
    acid sequence)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Specialised tissues can develop by cell differentiation in
multicellular organisms

â€¢ Â Differentiation involves the expression of some genes and not
others in a cellâ€™s genome

Â  Â Â 
Differentiation

Differentiation is the process during development whereby newly formed
cells become more specialised and distinct from one another as they
mature

All cells of an organism share anÂ identical genomeÂ â€“ each cell
contains theÂ entire set of genetic instructionsÂ for that organism

The activation of different instructions (genes) within a given cell by
chemical signals will cause it to differentiateÂ 

Cell Specialisation via Differential Gene Expression

[cell differentiation]

Gene Packaging

Within the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, DNA is packaged with proteins
to form chromatin

-   Active genes are usually packaged in an expanded form called
    euchromatin that is accessible to transcriptional machinery
-   Inactive genes are typically packaged in a more condensed form
    called heterochromatin (saves space, not transcribed)

Differentiated cells will have different regions of DNA packaged as
euchromatin and heterochromatin according to their specific function

Euchromatin versus Heterochromatin

[euchromatin and heterochromatin]
Cell Scale

Cells and their components are measured according to the metric system:

.[metric system]

Relative Sizes of Biological Materials

-   Eukaryotic cell (plant) = ~100Â Î¼m
-   Eukaryotic cell (animal) = ~10 â€“ 50Â Î¼m
-   Organelle (e.g. mitochondrion) = ~1 â€“ 10Â Î¼m
-   Prokaryotic cell (bacteria) = ~1 â€“ 5Â Î¼m

Principles of the Cell Theory

The cell theory states that:

2. Â The cell is the smallest unit of life

3. Â Cells only arise from pre-existing cells

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Questioning the cell theory using atypical examples (striated
muscle, giant algae, aseptate hyphae)

Â  Â Â 
Caveats to the Cell Theory

Certain types of cells / tissues do not conform to a standard notion of
what constitutes a cell:

-   Striated muscle fibres:
    -   Muscle cells fuse to form fibres that may be very long (>300mm)
    -   Consequently, they have multiple nuclei despite being surrounded
        by a single, continuous plasma membrane
    -   Challenges the idea that cells always function as autonomous
        units
-   Aseptate fungal hyphae:
    -   Fungi may have filamentous structures called hyphae, which are
        separated into cells by internal walls called septa
    -   Some fungi are not partitioned by septa and hence have a
        continuous cytoplasm along the length of the hyphae
    -   Challenges the idea that living structures are composed of
        discrete cells
-   Giant Algae
    -   Certain species of unicellular algae may grow to very large
        sizes (e.g. Acetabularia may exceed 7 cm in length)
    -   Challenges the idea that larger organisms are always made of
        many microscopic cells

interaction of their cellular components

Â  Â Â 
Emergent properties arise when the interaction of individual component
produce new functions

-   "The whole is greater than the sum of its partsâ€?Â â€“ Aristotle

Multicellullar organisms are capable of completing functions that
unicellular organisms could not undertake â€“ this is due to the
collective actions of individual cells combining to create new
synergistic effects
In multicellular organisms:

-   Cells may be grouped together to form tissues
-   Organs are then formed from the functional grouping of multiple
    tissues
-   Organs that interact may form organ systems capable of carrying out
    specific body functions
-   Organ systems collectively carry out the life functions of the
    complete organism

[mr sheng]

All living things carry out 7 basic functions integral to survival:

-   Metabolism â€“ Living things undertake essential chemical reactions
-   Reproduction â€“ Living things produce offspring, either sexually or
    asexually
-   Sensitivity â€“ LivingÂ things are responsive to internal and
    external stimuli
-   Homeostasis â€“ Living things maintain a stable internal environment
-   Excretion â€“ Living things exhibit the removal of waste products
-   Nutrition â€“ Living things exchange materials and gases with the
    environment
-   Growth â€“ Living things can move and change shape or size

How unicellular organisms fulfil these basic functions may differ
according to structure and habitat

1. Â Paramecium Â (heterotroph)

-   Paramecia are surrounded by small hairs called cilia which allow it
    to move (responsiveness)
-   Paramecia engulf food via a specialised membranous feeding groove
    called a cytostome (nutrition)
-   Food particles are enclosed within small vacuoles that contain
    enzymes for digestion (metabolism)
-   Solid wastes are removed via an anal pore, while liquid wastes are
    pumped out via contractile vacoules (excretion)
-   Essential gases enter (e.g. O₂) and exitÂ (e.g. CO₂)Â the cell via
    diffusion (homeostasis)
-   Paramecia divide asexually (fission) although horizontal gene
    transfer can occur via conjugation (reproduction)

Understandings:

-   According to the cell theory, living organisms are composed of cells
-   Organisms consisting of only one cell carry out all the functions of
    life in that cell
-   Surface area to volume ratio is important in the limitation of cell
    size
-   Multicellular organisms have properties that emerge from the

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of a light microscope to investigate the structure of cells
and tissues, with drawings of cells

Â  Â Â 
Light microscopes use visible light and a combination of lenses to
magnify images of mounted specimens

-   Living specimens can be viewed in their natural colour, although
    stains may be applied to resolve specific structures

When attempting to draw microscopic structures, the following
conventions should be followed:

-   A title should be included to identify the specimen (e.g. name of
    organism, tissue or cell)
-   A magnification or scale should be included to indicate relative
    size
-   Identifiable structures should be clearly labelled (drawings should
    only reflect what is seen, not idealised versions)

Summary of Visible Cell Features under Light Microscopy

[cells under microscopes]
Microscopes

Microscopes are scientific instruments that are used to visualise
objects that are too small to see with the naked eye

There are two main types of microscope: optical (light) microscopes and
electron microscopes

Light Microscopes

-   Use lenses to bend light and magnify images by a factor of roughly
    100-fold
-   Can be used to view living specimens in natural colour
-   Chemical dyes and fluorescent labelling may be applied to resolve
    specific structures

Electron Microscopes

-   Use electromagnets to focus electrons resulting in significantly
    greater magnifications and resolutions
-   Can be used to view dead specimens in monochrome (although false
    colour rendering may be applied)
    -   Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) pass electrons through
        specimen to generate a cross-section
    -   Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) scatter electrons over a
        surface to differentiate depth and map in 3D

SA : Vol Ratio

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Surface area to volume ratio is important in the limitation of
cell size

Â  Â Â 
Cells need to produce chemical energy (via metabolism) to survive and
this requires the exchange of materials with the environment

-   The rate of metabolism of a cell is a function of its mass /
    volumeÂ  (larger cells need more energy to sustain essential
    functions)
-   The rate of material exchange is a function of its surface areaÂ 
    (large membrane surface equates to more material movement)

As a cell grows, volume (units³) increases faster than surface area
(units²), leading to a decreased SA:Vol ratio

-   If metabolic rate exceeds the rate of exchange of vital materials
    and wastes (low SA:Vol ratio), the cell will eventually die
-   Hence growing cells tend to divide and remain small in order to
    maintain a high SA:Vol ratio suitable for survival

Overview of Surface Area to Volume Ratio

[SA-Vol ratio]

Increasing SA:Vol Ratio

Cells and tissues that are specialised for gas or material exchanges
will increase their surface area to optimise material transfer

-   Intestinal tissue of the digestive tract may form a ruffled
    structure (villi) to increase the surface area of the inner lining
-   Alveoli within the lungs have membranous extensions called
    microvilli, which function to increase the total membrane surface

[villi and microvilli]
Stem Cells

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The capacity of stem cells to divide and differentiate along
different pathways is necessary in embryonic

Â  Â developmentÂ and also makes stem cells suitable for therapeutic
uses

Â  Â Â 
When a cell differentiates and becomes specialised, it loses its
capacity to form alternative cell types

Stem cells are unspecialised cells that have two key qualities:

1. Â Self Renewal â€“ They can continuously divide and replicate

2. Â Potency â€“ They have the capacity to differentiate into
specialised cell types

Types of Stem Cells

There are four main types of stem cells present at various stages of
human development:

Totipotent â€“ Can form any cell type, as well as extra-embryonic
(placental) tissue (e.g. zygote)

Pluripotent â€“ Can form any cell type (e.g. embryonic stem cells)

Multipotent â€“ Can differentiate into a number of closely related cell
types (e.g.Â haematopoeitic adult stem cells)

Unipotent â€“ Can not differentiate, but are capable of self renewal
(e.g. progenitor cells, muscle stem cells)

[stem cells]

Uses of Stem Cells

Stem cells are necessary for embryonic development as they are an
undifferentiated cell source from which all other cell types may be
derived

Cell types that are not capable of self-renewal (e.g. amitotic nerve
tissues) are considered to be non-stem cells

As these tissues cannot be regenerated or replaced, stem cells have
become a viable therapeutic option when these tissues become damaged

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of stem cells to treat Stargardtâ€™s disease and one other
named condition

Â  Â Â 
Stem cells can be used to replace damaged or diseased cells with
healthy, functioning ones

This process requires:

-   The use of biochemical solutions to trigger the differentiation of
    stem cells into the desired cell type
-   Surgical implantation of cells into the patientâ€™s own tissue
-   Suppression of host immune system to prevent rejection of cells (if
    stem cells are from foreign source)
-   Careful monitoring of new cells to ensure they do not become
    cancerous

Examples of Stem Cell Therapy

1.Â Â Stargardtâ€™s Disease

-   An inherited form of juvenile macular degeneration that causes
    progressive vision loss to the point of blindness
-   Caused by a gene mutation that impairs energy transport in retinal
    photoreceptor cells, causing them to degenerate
-   Treated by replacing dead cells in the retina with functioning ones
    derived from stem cells

2.Â  Parkinsonâ€™s Disease

-   A degenerative disorder of the central nervous system caused by the
    death ofÂ dopamine-secreting cells in the midbrain
-   Dopamine is a neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting signals
    involved in the production of smooth, purposeful movements
-   Consequently, individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease typically
    exhibit tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement and postural
    instability
-   Treated by replacing dead nerve cells with living,
    dopamine-producing ones

3.Â Â Other Therapeutic Examples

-   Leukemia: Â Bone marrow transplants for cancer patients who are
    immunocompromised as a result of chemotherapy
-   Paraplegia: Â Repair damage caused by spinal injuries to enable
    paralysed victims to regain movement
-   Diabetes: Â Replace non-functioning islet cells with those capable
    of producing insulin in type I diabetics
-   Burn victims: Â Graft new skin cells to replace damaged tissue

Examples of Therapeutic Stem Cell Use

[Examples of stem cell therapy]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ethics of theÂ therapeutic use of stem cells from specially
created embryos, from the umbilicalÂ 

Â  Â cord blood of a new-born baby and from an adultâ€™s own tissues

Â  Â Â 
Stem cells can be derived from one of three sources:

-   Embryos (may be specially created by therapeutic cloning)
-   Umbilical cord blood or placenta of a new-born baby
-   Certain adult tissues like the bone marrow (cells are not
    pluripotent)Â 

The ethical considerations associated with the therapeutic use of stem
cells will depend on the source

-   Using multipotent adult tissue may be effective for certain
    conditions, but is limited in its scope of application
-   Stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood need to be stored and
    preserved at cost, raising issues of availability and access
-   The greatest yield of pluripotent stem cells comes from embryos, but
    requires the destruction of a potential living organism

Artificial Stem Cell Techniques

Stem cells can be artificially generated via nuclear transfer or nuclear
reprogramming, with distinct benefits and disadvantages

-   Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT):Â 
    -   Involves the creation of embryonic clones by fusing a diploid
        nucleus with an enucleated egg cell (therapeutic cloning)
    -   More embryos are created by this process than needed, raising
        ethical concerns about the exigency of excess embryos

-   Nuclear reprogramming:
    -   Induce a change in the gene expression profile of a cell in
        order to transform it into a different cell type
        (transdifferentiation)Â 
    -   Involves the use of oncogenic retroviruses and transgenes,
        increasing the risk of health consequences (i.e. cancer)

[types of stem cell therapies]
Animal versus Plant Cells

Animal cells and plant cells are both types of eukaryotic cells and
hence share many common features, including:

-   DNA stored within a nucleus
-   Larger ribosomes (80S in size)
-   A variety of membrane-bound organelles (e.g. mitochondria, ER, golgi
    apparatus)

However there are also a number of key differences that separate the two
types of cells, including:

-   Presence or absence of specific sub-cellular structures
-   Composition of the plasma membrane

â€¢ Â Eukaryotes have a compartmentalised cell structure

Â  Â Â 
Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells contain a nucleus (â€˜euâ€™Â = good
/ true ;Â â€˜karyonâ€™Â = nucleus)

They have a more complex structure and are believed to have evolved from
prokaryotic cells (via endosymbiosis)

Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalised by membrane-bound structures
(organelles) that perform specific roles

Eukaryotes can be divided into four distinct kingdoms:

-   Protista â€“ unicellular organisms; or multicellular organisms
    without specialised tissue
-   Fungi â€“ have a cell wall made of chitin and obtain nutrition via
    heterotrophic absorption
-   Plantae â€“ have a cell wall made of cellulose and obtain nutrition
    autotrophically (via photosynthesis)
-   Animalia â€“ no cell wall and obtain nutrition via heterotrophic

Â  Â Â 
Prokaryotes are organisms whose cells lack a nucleus Â ('pro' = before ;
'karyon' = nucleus)

They belong to the kingdom Monera and have been further classified into
two distinct domains:

-   Archaebacteria â€“ found in extreme environments like high
    temperatures, salt concentrations or pH (i.e. extremophiles)
-   Eubacteria â€“ traditional bacteria including most known pathogenic
    forms (e.g. E. coli, S. aureus, etc.)

Prokaryotic Features

Prokaryotic cells will typically contain the following cellular
components:

-   Cytoplasm â€“ internal fluid component of the cell
-   Nucleoid â€“ region of the cytoplasm where the DNA is located (DNA
    strand is circular and called a genophore)
-   Plasmids â€“ autonomous circular DNA molecules that may be
    transferred between bacteria (horizontal gene transfer)Â

Prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells differ in a number of key
features, including:

-   Reproduction (mode differs according to chromosome structure)
-   Average size (exceptions may exist)

Types of Bacteria

All bacteria share features common to every prokaryotic cell:

-   They lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles
-   They have circular DNA that is naked (not bound to protein)
-   They have smaller ribosomes (70S)

However different types of bacteria can be distinguished according to a
number of characteristics:

-   Shape â€“ Round (coccus), rod-like (bacillus), comma-shaped (vibrio)
    or spiral (spirilla / spirochete)
-   Cell wall composition â€“ Gram-positive (thick peptidoglycan layer)
    or Gram-negative (lipopolysaccharide layer)
-   Gaseous requirements â€“ Anaerobic (obligate or facultative) or
    aerobic
-   Nutritional patterns â€“ Autotrophic (photosynthetic or
    chemosynthetic) or heterotrophic

Bacterial Sub-Classifications

[types of bacteria]
Types of Cells

All living organisms can be classified into one of 3 domains (or 5
kingdoms) based on specific cell characteristics

-   Prokaryotes belong to one of two domains â€“ Archaea and Eubacteria
    â€“ which collectively form the kingdom Monera
-   Eukaryotes comprise a third domain and can be divided into four

Cholesterol

List

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cholesterol is a component of animal cell membranes

Â  Â Â 
Cholesterol is a component of animal cell membranes, where it functions
to maintain integrity and mechanical stability

-   It is absent in plant cells, as these plasma membranes are
    surrounded and supported by a rigid cell wall made of cellulose

[cholesterol molecule]

Cholesterol is an amphipathic molecule (like phospholipids), meaning it
has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions

-   Cholesterolâ€™s hydroxyl (-OH) group is hydrophilic and aligns
    towards the phosphate heads of phospholipids
-   The remainder of the molecule (steroid ring and hydrocarbon tail) is
    hydrophobic and associates with the phospholipid tails

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Cholesterol in mammalian membranes reduces membrane fluidity and
permeability to some solutes

Â  Â Â 
Phospholipid bilayers are fluid, in that the phospholipids are in
constant movement relative to one another

Cholesterol interacts with the fatty acid tails of phospholipids to
moderate the properties of the membrane:

-   Cholesterol functions to immobilise the outer surface of the
    membrane, reducing fluidity
-   It makes the membrane less permeable to very small water-soluble
    molecules that would otherwise freely cross
-   It functions to separate phospholipid tails and so prevent
    crystallisation of the membrane
-   It helps secure peripheral proteins by forming high density lipid
    rafts capable of anchoring the protein

Â Cholesterol in Mammalian Membranes

[cholesterol membrane]
Extracellular Matrix

The extracellular matrix is a mesh of protein fibres and glycoproteins
that exist externally of the cell in multicellular organisms

The extracellular matrix (ECM) typically provides structural and
biochemical support to surrounding cells, including:

-   Providing sites for anchorage by cells within a tissue and
    segregating separate tissues from one another
-   Sequestering and storing growth factors until receipt of a chemical
    signal (thereby regulating intercellular communication)

In plant cells the extracellular matrix includes cell wall components
(likeÂ cellulose) and hence plays an important role in:Â 

-   Regulating water uptake (maintainence of cell turgor)Â 
-   Providing mechanical strength and rigidity to the cell (maintains
    cell shape)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing of the fluid-mosaic model

Cell membranes are represented according to a fluid-mosaic model, due to
the fact that they are:

-   Fluid â€“ the phospholipid bilayer is viscous and individual
    phospholipids can move position
-   Mosaic â€“ the phospholipid bilayer is embedded with proteins,
    resulting in a mosaic of components

Structure of the Plasma Membrane (Fluid-Mosaic)

Essential Idea:

makes them fluid and dynamic

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Phospholipids form bilayers in water due to the amphipathic
    properties of phospholipid molecules
-   Membrane proteins are diverse in terms of structure, position in the
    membrane and function
-   Cholesterol is a component of animal cell membranes

Applications:

-   Cholesterol in mammalian membranes reduces membrane fluidity and
    permeability to some solutes

Skills:

-   Analysis of evidence from electron microscopy that lead to the
    proposal of the Davson-Danielli model
-   Analysis of the falsification of the Davson-Danielli model that lead
    to the Singer-Nicolson model
Membrane Fluidity

Cell membranes are fluid, meaning they are not fixed in position and can
adopt amorphous shapes

Membrane fluidity is enhanced at higher temperatures and is also
affected by the composition of the bilayer

Phospholipid Structure

Phospholipids may vary in the length and relative saturation of the
fatty acid tails

-   Shorter fatty acid tails will increase fluidity as they are less
    viscous and more susceptible to changes in kinetic energy
-   Lipid chains with double bonds (unsaturated fatty acids) have kinked
    hydrocarbon tails that are harder to pack togetherÂ 

[membrane fluidity]

Cholesterol

Cholesterol acts as a bi-directional regulator of membrane fluidity

-   At high temperatures it stabilises the membrane and raises the
    melting pointÂ 
-   At low temperatures it intercalates between the phospholipids and
    prevents clustering

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of evidence from electron microscopy that led to the
proposal of the Davson-Danielli modelÂ 

Â  Â Â 
The fluid-mosaic model was not the first scientifically accepted
paradigm to describe membrane structure

The first model that attempted to describe the position of proteins
within the bilayer was proposed by Hugh Davson and James Danielli in
1935

When viewed under a transmission electron microscope, membranes exhibit
a characteristic 'trilaminarâ€™Â appearance

-   Trilaminar = 3 layers (two dark outer layers and a lighter inner
    region)

Electron Micrograph of Plasma Membrane

[membrane EM]

Danielli and Davson proposed a model whereby two layers of protein
flanked a central phospholipid bilayer

-   The model was described as a 'lipo-protein sandwichâ€™, as the lipid
    layer was sandwiched between two protein layers
-   The dark segments seen under electron microscope were identified
    (wrongly) as representing the two protein layers

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of the falsification of the Davson-Danielli model that
led to the Singer-Nicolson modelÂ 

Â  Â Â 
There were a number of problems with the lipo-protein sandwich model
proposed by Davson and Danielli:

-   It assumed all membranes were of a uniform thickness and would have
    a constant lipid-protein ratioÂ 
-   It assumed all membranes would have symmetrical internal and
    external surfaces (i.e. not bifacial)
-   It did not account for the permeability of certain substances (did
    not recognise the need for hydrophilic pores)Â 
-   The temperatures at which membranes solidified did not correlate
    with those expected under the proposed modelÂ 

Falsification Evidence:

Membrane proteins were discovered to be insoluble in water (indicating
hydrophobic surfaces) and varied in size

-   Such proteins would not be able to form a uniform and continuous
    layer around the outer surface of a membrane

Fluorescent antibody tagging of membrane proteins showed they were
mobile and not fixed in place

-   Membrane proteins from two different cells were tagged with red and
    green fluorescent markers respectively
-   When the two cells were fused, the markers became mixed throughout
    the membrane of the fused cell
-   This demonstrated that the membrane proteins could move and did not
    form a static layer (as per Davson-Danielli)

Freeze fracturing was used to split open the membrane and revealed
irregular rough surfaces within the membraneÂ 

-   These rough surfaces were interpreted as beingÂ transmembrane
    proteins, demonstrating that proteins were not solely localised to
    the outside of the membrane structure

New Model:

In light of these limitations, a new model was proposed by Seymour
Singer and Garth Nicolson in 1972

According to this model, proteins were embedded within the lipid bilayer
rather than existing as separate layers

This model, known as the fluid-mosaic model, remains the model preferred
by scientists today (with refinements)

â€¢ Â Membrane proteins are diverse in terms of structure, position in
the membrane and function

Â  Â Â 
PhospholipidÂ bilayers are embedded with proteins, which may be either
permanently or temporarily attached to the membrane

-   Integral proteins are permanently attached to the membrane and are
    typically transmembrane (they span across the bilayer)
-   Peripheral proteins are temporarily attached by non-covalent
    interactions and associate with one surface of the membrane Â 

[channel protein]

Structure of Membrane Proteins

The amino acids of a membrane protein are localised according to
polarity:

-   Non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids associate directly with the
    lipid bilayerÂ 
-   Polar (hydrophilic) amino acids are located internally and face
    aqueous solutions

Transmembrane proteins typically adopt one of two tertiary structures:Â 

-   Single helices / helical bundlesÂ 
-   Beta barrels (common in channel proteins)

Phospholipid Bilayer

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Phospholipids form bilayers in water due to the amphipathic
properties of phospholipid molecules

[phospholipid structure]

Â  Â Â 
Structure of Phospholipids:

-   Consist of a polar head (hydrophilic) composed of a glycerol and a
    phosphate molecule
-   Consist of two non-polar tails (hydrophobic) composed of fatty acid
    (hydrocarbon) chains
-   Because phospholipids contain both hydrophilic (water-loving) and
    lipophilic (fat-loving) regions, they are classed as amphipathic

Arrangement in Membranes:

-   Phospholipids spontaneously arrange into a bilayer
-   The hydrophobic tail regions face inwards and are shielded from the
    surrounding polar fluids, while the two hydrophilic head regions
    associate with the cytosolic and extracellular fluids respectively

Properties of the Phospholipid Bilayer:

-   The bilayer is held together by weak hydrophobic interactions
    between the tails
-   Hydrophilic / hydrophobic layers restrict the passage of many
    substances
-   Individual phospholipids can move within the bilayer, allowing for
    membrane fluidity and flexibility
-   This fluidity allows for the spontaneous breaking and reforming of
    membranes (endocytosis / exocytosis)
Phospholipids

Phospholipids are one of the principle components of cell membranes (in
conjunction with membrane proteins)

They are amphipathic molecules, meaning they have clearly discernible
hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions

Phospholipids typically share a common basic structure that includes:

-   A polar organic molecule (e.g. choline, serine)
-   A phosphate group
-   A glycerol molecule (replaced by sphingosine in sphingomyelin)
-   Two fatty acid tails (may be saturated or unsaturated)

Active Transport

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Active transport uses energy to move molecules against a concentration
gradient

This energy may either be generated by:Â 

-   The direct hydrolysis of ATP (primary active transport)
-   Indirectly coupling transport with another molecule that is moving
    along its gradient (secondary active transport)

Active transport involves the use of carrier proteins (called protein
pumps due to their use of energy)

-   A specific solute will bind to the protein pump on one side of the
    membrane
-   The hydrolysis of ATP (to ADP + Pi) causes a conformational change
    in the protein pump
-   The solute molecule is consequently translocated across the membrane
    (against the gradient) and released

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Structure and function of sodium-potassium pumps for active
transport and potassium channels forÂ 

Â  Â facilitatedÂ diffusion in axons

Â  Â Â 
The axons of nerve cells transmit electrical impulses by translocating
ions to create a voltage difference across the membrane

-   At rest, the sodium-potassium pump expels sodium ions from the nerve
    cell, while potassium ions are accumulated within
-   When the neuron fires, these ions swap locations via facilitated
    diffusion via sodium andÂ potassium channels

Sodium-Potassium Pump

An integral protein that exchanges 3 sodium ions (moves out of cell)
with two potassium ions (moves into cell)

The process of ion exchange against the gradient is energy-dependent and
involves a number of key steps:

1.  Three sodium ions bind to intracellular sites on the
    sodium-potassium pump
2.  A phosphate group is transferred to the pump via the hydrolysis of
    ATP
3.  The pump undergoes a conformational change, translocating sodium
    across the membrane
4.  The conformational change exposes two potassium binding sites on the
    extracellular surface of the pump
5.  The phosphate group is released which causes the pump to return to
    its original conformation
6.  This translocates the potassium across the membrane, completing the
    ion exchange

Bulk Transport

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The fluidity of membranes allows materials to be taken into cells
by endocytosis or released by exocytosisÂ 

Â  Â Â 
The membrane is principally held together by weak hydrophobic
associations between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids

This weak association allows for membrane fluidity and flexibility, as
the phospholipids can move around to some extent

This allows for the spontaneous breaking and reforming of the bilayer,
allowing larger materials to enter or leave the cell without having to
cross the membrane (this is an active process and requires ATP
hydrolysis)

[cytosis]

Endocytosis

The process by which large substances (or bulk amounts of smaller
substances) enter the cell without crossing the membrane

-   An invagination of the membrane forms a flask-like depression which
    envelopes the extracellular material
-   The invagination is then sealed off to form an intracellular vesicle
    containing the material

There are two main types of endocytosis:

-   Phagocytosis â€“ The process by which solid substances are ingested
    (usually to be transported to the lysosome)
-   Pinocytosis â€“ The process by which liquids / dissolved substances
    are ingested (allows faster entry than via protein channels)Â 

Endocytosis via an Electron Microscope

[endocytosis EM]

Exocytosis

The process by which large substances (or bulk amounts of small
substances) exit the cell without crossing the membrane

-   Vesicles (typically derived from the Golgi) fuse with the plasma
    membrane, expelling their contents into the extracellular
    environment
-   The process of exocytosis adds vesicular phospholipids to the cell
    membrane, replacing those lost when vesicles are formed via
    endocytosis

Process of Exocytosis

[exocytosis]
Cotransport

Active transport involves the movement of materials against a
concentration gradient and requires an expenditure of energy

This energy may be harnessed by one of two means:

-   The direct hydrolysis of ATP (primary active transport)
-   By coupling with the transport of another molecule moving along its
    electrochemical gradient (secondary active transport)

The coupled transport of two distinct molecules is called co-transport
(the movement of a single molecule is called uniport)

-   If the two molecules are transported in the same direction it is
    called symport
-   If the two molecules are transported in opposite directions it is
    calledÂ antiport

The sodium-potassium pump is an example of anÂ antiporter as sodium and
potassium are pumped in opposite directions

-   This is primary active transport as both molecules are pumped
    against their gradient and require ATP hydrolysis

Glucose uptake in the kidneys is an example of symport as its movement
is coupled to the parallel transport of sodium

-   This is secondary active transport as the sodium is moving passively
    down an electrochemical gradient Â

Facilitated Diffusion

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Facilitated diffusion is the passive movement of molecules across the
cell membrane via the aid of a membrane protein

-   It is utilised by molecules that are unable to freely cross the
    phospholipid bilayer (e.g. large, polar molecules and ions)Â 
-   This process is mediated by two distinct types of transport proteins
    â€“ channel proteins and carrier proteins

Carrier Proteins

-   Integral glycoproteins which bind a solute and undergo a
    conformational change to translocate the solute across the membrane
-   Carrier proteins will only bind a specific molecule via an
    attachment similar to an enzyme-substrate interaction
-   Carrier proteins may move molecules against concentration gradients
    in the presence of ATP (i.e. are used in active transport)
-   Carrier proteins have a much slower rate of transport than channel
    proteins (by an order of ~1,000 molecules per second)

Channel Proteins

-   Integral lipoproteins which contain a pore via which ions may cross
    from one side of the membrane to the other
-   Channel proteins are ion-selective and may be gated to regulate the
    passage of ions in response to certain stimuli
-   Channel proteins only move molecules along a concentration gradient
    (i.e. are not used in active transport)
-   Channel proteins have a much faster rate of transport than carrier
    proteins

Potassium Channels

-   Integral proteins with a hydrophilic inner pore via which potassium
    ions may be transported
-   The channel is comprised of four transmembrane subunits, while the
    inner pore contains a selectivity filter at its narrowest region
    that restricts passage of alternative ions
-   Potassium channels are typically voltage-gated and cycle between an
    opened and closed conformation depending on the transmembrane
    voltage

Kidney dialysis involves the external filtering of blood in order to
remove metabolic wastes in patients with kidney failureÂ 

Blood is removed and pumped through a dialyzer, which has two key
functions that are common to biological membranes:

-   It contains a porous membrane that is semi-permeable (restricts
    passage of certain materials)
-   It introduces fresh dialysis fluid and removes wastes to maintain an
    appropriate concentration gradient

â€¢ Â Estimation of osmolarity in tissues by bathing samples in

Â  Â Â 
Osmolarity is a measure of solute concentration, as defined by the
number ofÂ osmoles of a solute per litre of solution (osmol/L)

Solutions may be loosely categorised as hypertonic, hypotonic or
isotonic according to their relative osmolarity

-   Solutions with a relatively higher osmolarity are categorised as
    hypertonic (high solute concentrationÂ â‡’ gains water)
-   Solutions with a relatively lower osmolarity are categorised as
    hypotonic (low solute concentrationÂ â‡’Â loses water)
-   Solutions that have the same osmolarity are categorised as isotonic
    (same solute concentrationÂ â‡’Â no net water flow)

Estimating Osmolarity

The osmolarity of a tissue may be interpolated by bathing the sample in
solutions with known osmolarities

-   The tissue will lose water when placed in hypertonic solutions and
    gain water when placed in hypotonic solutions
-   Water loss or gain may be determined by weighing the sample before
    and after bathing in solution
-   Tissue osmolarity may be inferred by identifying the concentration
    of solution at which there is no weight change (i.e. isotonic)

in a solution with the same osmolarityÂ 

Â  Â as the cytoplasm to prevent osmosis

Â  Â Â 
Tissues or organs to be used in medical procedures must be kept in
solution to prevent cellular dessication

This solution must share the same osmolarity as the tissue / organ (i.e.
isotonic) in order to prevent osmosis from occurring

Uncontrolled osmosis will have negative effects with regards to cell
viability:

-   In hypertonic solutions, water will leave the cell causing it to
    shrivel (crenation)
-   In hypotonic solutions, water will enter the cell causing it to
    swell and potentially burst (lysis)

In plant tissues, the effects of uncontrolled osmosis are moderated by
the presence of an inflexible cell wall

-   In hypertonic solutions, the cytoplasm will shrink (plasmolysis) but
    the cell wall will maintain a structured shape
-   In hypotonic solutions, the cytoplasm will expand but be unable to
    rupture within the constraints of the cell wall (turgor)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a semi-permeable
membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high
solute concentration (until equilibrium is reached)

-   Water is considered the universal solvent â€“ it will associate
    with, and dissolve, polar or charged molecules (solutes)
-   Because solutes cannot cross a cell membrane unaided, water will
    move to equalise the two solutions
-   At a higher solute concentration there are less free water molecules
    in solution as water is associated with the solute
-   Osmosis is essentially the diffusion of free water molecules and
    hence occurs from regions of low solute concentration

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Diffusion is the net movement of molecules from a region of high
concentration to a region of low concentration

-   This directional movement along a gradient is passive and will
    continue until molecules become evenly dispersed (equilibrium)Â 
-   Small and non-polar (lipophilic) molecules will be able to freely
    diffuse across cell membranes (e.g. O₂, CO₂, glycerol)

The rate of diffusion can be influenced by a number of factors,
including:

-   Temperature Â (affects kinetic energy of particles in solution)
-   Molecular size Â (larger particles are subjected to greater
    resistance within a fluid medium)
-   Steepness of gradient Â (rate of diffusion will be greater with a
    higher concentration gradient)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Cellular membranes possess two key qualities:

-   They are semi-permeable (only certain materials may freely cross â€“
    large and charged substances are typically blocked)
-   They are selective (membrane proteins may regulate the passage of
    material that cannot freely cross)

Movement of materials across a biological membrane may occur either
actively or passively

Passive Transport

Passive transport involves the movement of material along a
concentration gradient (high concentrationÂ â‡’Â low concentration)

Because materials are moving down a concentration gradient, it does not
require the expenditure of energy (ATP hydrolysis)

There are three main types of passive transport:

-   Simple diffusion â€“ movement of small or lipophilic molecules (e.g.
    O₂, CO₂, etc.)
-   Osmosis â€“ movement of water molecules (dependent on solute
    concentrations)
-   Facilitated diffusion â€“ movement of large or charged molecules via
    membrane proteins (e.g. ions, sucrose, etc.)

Active Transport

Active transport involves the movement of materials against a
concentration gradientÂ (low concentrationÂ â‡’Â high concentration)

Because materials are moving against the gradient, it requires the
expenditure of energy (e.g. ATP hydrolysis)

There are two main types of active transport:

-   Primary (direct) active transport â€“ Involves the direct use of
    metabolic energy (e.g. ATP hydrolysis) to mediate transport
-   Secondary (indirect) active transport â€“ Involves coupling the
    molecule with another moving along an electrochemical gradient

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Vesicles move materials within cells

Â  Â Â 
Materials destined for secretion are transported around the cell in
membranous containers called vesicles

Endoplasmic Reticulum

The endoplasmic reticulum is a membranous network that is responsible
for synthesising secretory materials

-   Rough ER is embedded with ribosomes and synthesises proteins
    destined for extracellular use
-   Smooth ER is involved in lipid synthesis and also plays a role in
    carbohydrate metabolism

Materials are transported from the ER when the membrane bulges and then
buds to create a vesicle surrounding the material

Golgi Apparatus

The vesicle is then transported to the Golgi apparatus and fuses to the
internal (cis) face of the complex

-   Materials move via vesicles from the internal cis face of the Golgi
    to the externally orientedÂ trans face
-   While within the Golgi apparatus, materials may be structurally
    modified (e.g. truncated, glycosylated, etc.)

Material sorted within the Golgi apparatus will either be secreted
externally or may be transported to the lysosome

Plasma Membrane

Vesicles containing materials destined for extracellular use will be
transported to the plasma membrane

The vesicle will fuse with the cell membrane and its materials will be
expelled into the extracellular fluid
Materials sorted by the Golgi apparatus may be either:

-   Released immediately into the extracellular fluid (constitutive
    secretion)
-   Stored within an intracellular vesicle for a delayed release in
    response to a cellular signal (regulatory secretion)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cells can only be formed by division of pre-existing cells

Â  Â Â 
The chemical processes that contributed to the initial formation of
biological life required specific conditions to proceed

-   This included a reducing atmosphere and high temperatures (>100ÂºC)
    or electrical discharges to catalyse chemical reactions

These conditions do not commonly exist on modern Earth and hence living
cells cannot arise independently by abiogenesis

-   Instead, cells can only be formed by the division of pre-existing
    cells (biogenesis)Â

of cells and organisms does notÂ nowÂ

Biogenesis describes the principle that living things only arise from
other living things by reproduction (not spontaneous generation)

-   "Omne vivum ex vivoâ€?Â â€“ All life (is) from life

The law of biogenesis is largely attributed to Louis Pasteur, who
demonstrated that emergent bacterial growth in nutrient broths was due
to contamination by pre-existing cells

-   Broths were stored in vessels that contained long tubings (swan neck
    ducts) that did not allow external dust particles to pass
-   The broths were boiled to kill any micro-organisms present in the
    growth medium (sterilisation)
-   Growth only occurred in the broth if the flask was broken open,
    exposing the contents to contaminants from the outside
-   From this it was concluded that emergent bacterial growth came from
    external contaminants and did not spontaneously occur

endosymbiotic theory

Â  Â Â 
An endosymbiont is a cell which lives inside another cell with mutual
benefit

Eukaryotic cells are believed to have evolved fromÂ early prokaryotes
that were engulfed by phagocytosis

The engulfed prokaryotic cell remained undigested as it contributed new
functionality to the engulfing cell (e.g. photosynthesis)

Over generations, the engulfed cell lost some of its independent utility
and became a supplemental organelle

Evidence for Endosymbiosis

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are both organelles suggested to have
arisen via endosymbiosis

Evidence that supports the extracellular origins of these organelles can
be seen by looking at certain key features:

-   Membranes (double membrane bound)
-   Antibiotics (susceptibility)
-   Division (mode of replication)
-   DNA (presence and structural composition)

Non-living Synthesis

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The first cells must have arisen from non-living material

Â  Â Â 
The theory that living cells arose from non-living matter is known as
abiogenesis

This process is theorised to have occurred over four key stages:

-   There was non-living synthesis of simple organic molecules (from
    primordial inorganic molecules)
-   These simple organic molecules became assembled into more complex
    polymers
-   Certain polymers formed the capacity to self-replicate (enabling
    inheritance)
-   These molecules became packaged into membranes with an internal
    chemistry different from their surroundings (protobionts)

Miller-Urey Experiment

The non-living synthesis of simple organic molecules has been
demonstrated by the Miller-Urey experiment

Stanley Miller and Harold Urey recreated the postulated conditions of
pre-biotic Earth using a closed system of flasks and tubes

-   Water was boiled to vapour to reflect the high temperatures common
    to Earthâ€™s original conditions
-   The vapour was mixed with a variety of gases (including H₂, CH₄,
    NH₃) to create a reducing atmosphere (no oxygen)
-   This mixture was then exposed to an electrical discharge (simulating
    the effects of lightning as an energy source for reactions)
-   The mixture was then allowed to cool (concentrating components) and
    left for a period of ~1 week
-   After this time, the condensed mixture was analysed and found to
    contain traces of simple organic molecules

Overview of the Miller-Urey Experiment

[Miller-Urey]
Origins of Life

The initial formation of primitive living structures (protocells) is
thought to require a specific supporting chemical environment

-   Early Earth had a chemically-reducing atmosphere, which when exposed
    to energy in various forms (heat, electrical discharge, etc.)
    produced a variety of simple organic compounds (monomers)
-   These compounds accumulated in a molecularÂ â€˜soupâ€™, allowing for
    the formation of more complex compounds (polymers)

There are a number of locations posited as providing suitable conditions
for the formation of a concentrated chemical soup, including volcanoes,
hydrothermal vents, shorelines and outer space

Â 
1. Â Volcanoes

-   The gas composition of volcanic eruptions contain high levels of
    fixed nitrogen and other raw materials which could be used for
    primitive metabolism
-   Intensive volcanic activity could also generate sufficient thermal
    energy to catalyse the formation of organic molecules

2.Â Â Hydrothermal Vents

-   Hydrothermal vents are regions of the ocean floor where superheated
    water is released from the Earthâ€™s crust
-   These vents also release hydrogen-rich fluids to create a chemical
    gradient and pH viable for organic synthesis

3.Â  Shorelines

-   Organic life may have evolved at a sea shore or other region where
    there is an alternation of wet and dry conditions
-   The drying of clay particles could have precipitated catalysing
    reactions needed for the formation of organic molecules

4.Â  Extraterrestrial Origins

-   The necessary conditions required for the formation of life may have
    initially been derived on other planets (e.g. Mars)
-   Comets contain a variety of organic material (~20% of a cometâ€™s
    tail is comprised of organic matter)
-   Heavy meteorite bombardment approximately 4 billion years ago may
    have delivered organic material to the Earth
-   The theory that life on Earth was initially seeded in space or on
    another planet is called panspermia

Possible Origins for Life on Earth

[panspermia]
Oxygen Enrichment

Primordial Earth had a reducing atmosphere that contained very low
levels of oxygen gas

After about ~2 billion years of prokaryotic life, a form of chlorophyll
evolved in prokaryotes (forming cyanobacteria)

This allowed for the process of photosynthesis to occur, creating oxygen
gas as a by-product via the photolysis of water

The increase in oxygen in the atmosphere was coupled to a number of
significant effects:

-   There was a breakdown of chemicals in the atmosphere and oceans to
    produce oxidised compounds (e.g. CO₂)
-   There was an evolution of organisms capable of breaking down
    oxygen-rich oxidising agents (e.g. aerobes)
-   The subsequent formation of an ozone layer restricted UV radiation
    to allow for the proliferation of a wider range of life forms

[oxygen enrichment]
RNA World Hypothesis

The RNA world hypothesis proposes that a world filled with RNA-based
life predates current DNA-based lifeforms

RNA has two key qualities that would have allowed it to function in this
manner:

RNA can self-replicate

-   RNA is able to store information in a sequence composed of four
    recurring nucleotides (similar to DNA)
-   Short sequences of RNA are able to be accurately duplicated to form
    identical RNA molecules

RNA can act as a catalyst

-   Modern cells use RNA catalysts (called ribozymes) to remove introns
    from mRNA and help synthesise new RNA molecules
-   In ribosomes, rRNA functions as the catalytic component and plays a
    pivotal role in peptide bond formation

RNA is the only molecule that is capable of both self-replication and
catalytic functioning, but has since beenÂ superseded:

-   DNA, through its superior chemical stability (double helical
    structure) has taken over as the data storage form
-   Protein, through its greater variability (20 amino acids as opposed
    to 4 nucleotide bases) has taken over as the catalytic form
-   RNA remains as a transitional form between DNA and protein,
    suggestive of its multi-faceted originsÂ 

Summary of the RNA World Hypothesis

Cancer Cells

Cancer cells can commonly avoid immune detection as they are not foreign
bodies but abnormally functioning body cells

This makes them difficult to treat â€“ common strategies involve
surgical removal and chemotherapy

However there are a number of differences between normal and cancerous
tissues which may provide the basis for the development of future
therapies

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mutagens, oncogenes and metastasis are involved in the development
of primary and secondary tumoursÂ 

Â  Â Â 
Tumours are abnormal cell growths resulting from uncontrolled cell
division and can occur in any tissue or organ

-   Diseases caused by the growth of tumours are collectively known as
    cancers

Mutagens

A mutagen is an agent that changes the genetic material of an organism
(either acts on the DNA or the replicative machinery)

Mutagens may be physical, chemical or biological in origin:

-   Physical â€“ Sources of radiation including X-rays
    (ionising),Â ultraviolet (UV) light and radioactive decay
-   Chemical â€“ DNA interacting substances including reactive oxygen
    species (ROS) and metals (e.g. arsenic)
-   Biological â€“ Viruses, certain bacteria and mobile genetic elements
    (transposons)

Mutagens that lead to the formation of cancer are further classified as
carcinogens

Oncogenes

An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer

Most cancers are caused by mutations to two basic classes of genes
â€“Â proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes

-   Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that stimulate the cell cycle and
    promote cell growth and proliferation
-   Tumour suppressor genes code for proteins that repress cell cycle
    progression and promote apoptosis

When aÂ proto-oncogene is mutated or subjected to increased expression
it becomes a cancer-causing oncogene

Tumour suppressor genes are sometimes referred to as anti-oncogenes, as
their normal function prevents cancer

Relationship between Proto-Oncogenes and Tumour Suppressor Genes

[oncogene]

Metastasis

Tumour cells may either remain in their original location (benign) or
spread and invade neighbouring tissue (malignant)

Metastasis is the spread of cancer from one location (primary tumour) to
another, forming a secondary tumour

Secondary tumours are made up of the same type of cell as the primary
tumour â€“ this affects the type of treatment required

-   E.g. If breast cancer spread to the liver, the patient has secondary
    breast cancer of the liver (treat with breast cancer drugs)

Formation of Secondary Tumours via Metastasis

[metastasis]
Cell Checkpoints

Cell cycle checkpoints are mechanisms that ensure the fidelity and
continued viability of mitotic division in cells

Multiple checkpoints have been discovered, each with different specific
roles:

G₁ Checkpoint:

-   Determine appropriate growth conditions (sufficient nutrients, cell
    size, presence of growth factors, etc.)
-   Assess level of DNA damage (fromÂ ionising radiation or UV)Â 

G₂ Checkpoint:

-   Determine state of pre-mitotic cell (suitable cell size required for
    successful division)
-   Identify an replication faults (changes to DNA sequence will distort
    genetic fidelity in daughter cells)

Metaphase Checkpoint:

-   Ensure proper spindle assembly and correct attachment to centromeres
    (prevents non-disjunction events)

Cell Cycle Checkpoints

[cell checkpoints]

G0 Stage

Not all cells are continually replicating â€“ some cells may enter into
a non-dividing G₀ stage

These cells may either be dormant (quiescent) or ageing and
deteriorating (senescent)

Cells enter the G₀ phase from the G₁ phase; quiescent cells may re-enter
G₁ at a later time (senescent cells do not)

Normally, cells will only divide a finite time before reaching
senescence (a typical human cell will divide ~ 40 - 60 times)

Specialised cells will often permanently enter G₀, as differentiation
has prevented their capacity for further division Â 

Neurons are examples of cells that have been arrested in a G₀ state â€“
these cells are amitotic (cannot divide)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mitosis is division of the nucleus into two genetically identical
daughter nuclei

Â  Â Â 
The cell cycle is an ordered set of events which culminates in the
division of a cell into two daughter cells

-   It can be roughly divided into two main phases:

Interphase

The stage in the development of a cell between two successive divisions

This phase of the cell cycle is a continuum of three distinct stages:

-   G¹ â€“ First intermediate gap stage in which the cell grows and
    prepares for DNA replication
-   S â€“ Synthesis stage in which DNA is replicated
-   G² â€“ Second intermediate gap stage in which the cell finishes
    growing and prepares for cell division

M phase

The period of the cell cycle in which the cell and contents divide to
create two genetically identical daughter cells

This phase is comprised of two distinct stages:

-   Mitosis â€“ Nuclear division, whereby DNA (as condensed chromosomes)
    is separated into two identical nuclei
-   Cytokinesis â€“ Cytoplasmic division, whereby cellular contents are
    segregated and the cell splits into two

The Cell Cycle

[cell cycle]
Cell Death

The death of a cell may occur by one of two main mechanisms â€“ necrosis
or apoptosis

While necrosis is a traumatic cellular response that is detrimental,
apoptosis is an important and necessary cellular process

Necrosis is uncontrolled cell death (â€˜cell homicideâ€™)

-   Necrosis is the premature death of a cell, caused by disruption to
    the cell by injury, toxins or nutritional deprivation
-   The cell loses functional control and there is destabilisation of
    the plasma and organelle membranes
-   This leads to swelling of the cell and organelles due to increased
    osmotic pressure, and the cell eventually bursts
-   The uncontrolled release of cell contents causes inflammation,
    potentially damaging surrounding tissue

Apoptosis is programmed cell death (â€˜cell suicideâ€™)

-   Apoptosis is a controlled event regulated by molecular signals which
    inhibit or promote this process
-   Mitochondrial proteins play an important role in initiating
    apoptotic processes
-   Catabolic reactions are triggered which digest cytoplasmic
    components, including the cytoskeleton
-   The plasma membrane undergoes irregular bulging, or blebbing, and
    cell contents are repackaged for safe removal
-   The cell shrinks and fragments into apoptotic bodies which are
    subsequently engulfed by neighbouring cells

Mechanisms of Cell Death

[cell death]

Apoptosis versus Necrosis

Apoptosis and necrosis can be distinguished according to a number of
differential features â€“ these include:

[sumo]

-   Size (cellular response and area of effect)
-   Uptake (destination of contents and localised effects)
-   Membrane (integrity of bilayer)
-   Organelles (preserved or destroyed)

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cyclins are involved in the control of the cell cycle

Â  Â Â 
Mechanism of Cyclin Action

Cyclins are a family of regulatory proteins that control the progression
of the cell cycle

Cyclins activate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), which control cell
cycle processes through phosphorylation

-   When a cyclin and CDK form a complex, the complex will bind to a
    target protein and modify it via phosphorylation
-   The phosphorylated target protein will trigger some specific event
    within the cell cycle (e.g. centrosome duplication, etc.)
-   After the event has occurred, the cyclin is degraded and the CDK is
    rendered inactive again

[cyclin activity]

Cyclin Expression Patterns

Cyclin concentrations need to be tightly regulated in order to ensure
the cell cycle progresses in a proper sequence

-   Different cyclins specifically bind to, and activate, different
    classes of cyclin dependent kinases
-   Cyclin levels will peak when their target protein is required for
    function and remain at lower levels at all other times

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cytokinesis occurs after mitosis and is different in plant and
animal cells

Â  Â Â 
Cytokinesis is the process of cytoplasmic division, whereby the cell
splits into two identical daughter cells

Cytokinesis occurs concurrently with the final stage of mitosis
(telophase) and is different in plant and animal cells

Animal Cells

-   After anaphase, microtubule filaments form a concentric ring around
    the centre of the cell
-   The microfilaments constrict to form a cleavage furrow, which
    deepens from the periphery towards the centre
-   When the furrow meets in the centre, the cell becomes completely
    pinched off and two cells are formed
-   Because this separation occurs from the outside and moves towards
    the centre, it is described as centripetal

[animal cytokinesis]

Plant Cells

-   After anaphase, carbohydrate-rich vesicles form in a row at the
    centre of the cell (equatorial plane)
-   The vesicles fuse together and an early cell plate begins to form
    within the middle of the cell
-   The cell plate extends outwards and fuses with the cell wall,
    dividing the cell into two distinct daughter cells
-   Because this separation originates in the centre and moves
    laterally, it is described as centrifugal

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chromosomes condense by supercoiling during mitosis

Â  Â Â 
Chromatin versus Chromosome

Chromatin:

-   DNA is usually loosely packed within the nucleus as unravelled
    chromatin
-   In this unravelled form, the DNA is accessible to transcriptional
    machinery and so genetic information can be translated
-   DNA is organised as chromatin in all non-dividing cells and
    throughout the process of interphase

Chromosome:

-   DNA is temporarily packaged into a tightly wound and condensed
    chromosome prior to division (viaÂ supercoiling)
-   In this condensed form, the DNA is able to be easily segregated
    however is inaccessible to transcriptional machinery
-   DNA is organised as chromosomes during the process of mitosis
    (condense in prophase, decondense in telophase)

Organisation of DNA into a Mitotic Chromosome

[mitotic chromosome]

Chromosome versus Chromatid

A chromosome is the condensed form of DNA which is visible during
mitosis (via microscopy)

As the DNA is replicated during the S phase of interphase, the
chromosome will initially contain two identical DNA strands

These genetically identical strands are called sister chromatids and are
held together by a central region called the centromere

When these chromatids separate during mitosis, they become independent
chromosomes, each made of a single DNA strand

Single Chromatid versus Sister Chromatid Chromosome

[chromatid vs chromosome]
Functions of Mitosis

Mitosis functions as part of the process by which cells are cloned to
make genetically identical daughter cells

-   There are four key reasons why a cell may be required to divide
    mitotically:

[toad]

Tissue repair / replacementÂ 

-   Damaged or aged cells replaced with identical healthy ones

Organismal growth

-   Multicellular organisms derive new cells via mitotis

Asexual reproduction

-   Vegetative propagation in plants occurs via mitotic division

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of phases of mitosis in cells viewed with a
microscope or in a micrograph

Â  Â Â 
Mitosis is the process of nuclear division, whereby duplicated DNA
molecules are arranged into two separate nuclei

Mitosis is preceded by interphase and is divided into four distinct
stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase

-   The division of the cell in two (cytokinesis) occurs concurrently
    with the final stage of mitosis (telophase)

Before Mitosis

[interphase]

Interphase:

-   DNA is present as uncondensed chromatin (not visible under
    microscope)
-   DNA is contained within a clearly defined nucleus
-   Centrosomes and other organelles have beenÂ duplicated
-   Cell is enlarged in preparation for division

Stages of Mitosis

[mitosis]

Prophase:

-   DNA supercoils and chromosomes condense (becoming visible under
    microscope)
-   Chromosomes are comprised of genetically identical sister chromatids
    (joined at a centromere)
-   Paired centrosomes move to the opposite poles of the cell and form
    microtubule spindle fibres
-   The nuclear membrane breaks down and the nucleus dissolves

Metaphase:

-   Microtubule spindle fibres from both centrosomes connect to the
    centromere of each chromosome
-   Microtubule depolymerisation causes spindle fibres to shorten in
    length and contract
-   This causes chromosomes to align along the centre of the cell
    (equatorial plane or metaphase plate)

Anaphase:

-   Continued contraction of the spindle fibres causes genetically
    identical sister chromatids to separate
-   Once the chromatids separate, they are each considered an individual
    chromosome in their own right
-   The genetically identical chromosomes move to the opposite poles of
    the cell

Telophase:

-   Once the two chromosome sets arrive at the poles, spindle fibres
    dissolve
-   Chromosomes decondense (no longer visible under light microscope)
-   Nuclear membranes reform around each chromosome set
-   Cytokinesis occurs concurrently, splitting the cell into two

population (i.e. the proportion of dividing cells)Â 

The mitotic index may be elevated during processes that promote
division, such as normal growth or cellular repair

-   It also functions as an important prognostic tool for predicting the
    response of cancer cells to chemotherapy

Identifying Mitotic Cells

Cells undergoing mitosis will lack a clearly defined nucleus and possess
visibly condensed chromosomes

-   Prophase â€“ Chromosomes condensed but still confined to a nuclear
    region
-   Metaphase â€“ Chromosomes aligned along the equator of the cell
-   Anaphase â€“ Two distinct clusters of chromosomes apparent at poles
    of the cell
-   Telophase â€“ Two nuclear regions present within a single cell
    (difficult to see as cytokinesis occurs concurrently)

[stages of mitosis]

Calculating Mitotic Index

The mitotic index is the ratio between the number of cells in mitosis
and the total number of cells

It can be determined by analysing micrographs and counting the relative
number of mitotic cells versus non-dividing cells

â€¢ Â The correlation between smoking and incidence of cancers

Â  Â Â 
A significant body of scientific literature exists which provides a
strong linkÂ between smoking and the incidence of cancers

-   Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, over 60 of
    which are known to be carcinogenic

There appears to be a strong positive correlation between the frequency
of smoking and the development of cancer

-   The risk of lung cancer is strongly correlated with smoking, with
    ~90% of lung cancers attributable to tobacco use
-   Smoking also increases the risk of over a dozen other cancers,
    including mouth, stomach, liver, panceas and bowel

Â  Â Â 
Anabolic reactions describe the set of metabolic reactions that build up
complex molecules from simpler ones

The synthesis of organic molecules via anabolism typically occurs via
condensation reactions

Condensation reactions occur when monomers are covalently joined and
water is produced as a by-product

-   Monosaccharides are joined via glycosidic linkages to form
    disaccharides and polysaccharides
-   Amino acids are joined via peptide bonds to make polypeptide
    chainsÂ

organisms but can also beÂ artificiallyÂ synthesised

Â  Â Â 
Vitalism was a doctrine that dictated that organic molecules could only
be synthesised by living systems

-   It was believed that living things possessed a certainÂ â€œvital
    forceâ€?Â needed to make organic molecules
-   Hence organic compounds were thought to possess a non-physical
    element lacking from inorganic molecules

Vitalism as a theory has since been disproven with the discovery that
organic molecules can be artificially synthesised

-   In 1828, Frederick Woehler heated an inorganic salt (ammonium
    cyanate) and produced urea
-   Urea is a waste product of nitrogen metabolism and is eliminated by
    the kidneys in mammals

Organic Compounds

An organic compound is a compound that contains carbon and is found in
living things

-   Exceptions include carbides (e.g. CaC₂), carbonates (CO₃^(2â€“)),
    oxides of carbon (CO, CO₂) and cyanides (CN^(â€“)) Â 

CarbonÂ 

Carbon forms the basis of organic life due to its ability to form large
and complex molecules via covalent bonding

Carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds, with bonds between carbon
atoms being particularly stable (catenation)Â 

-   These properties allows carbon to form a wide variety of organic
    compounds that are chemically stable

Â  Â Â 
Main Classes of Carbon Compounds

There are four principle groups of organic compounds that contribute to
much of the structure and function of a cell
Carbohydrates

-   Most abundant organic compound found in nature, composedÂ primarily
    of C,H and O atoms in a common ratio â€“ (CH₂O)_(n)
-   Principally function as a source of energy (and as a short-term
    energy storage option)
-   Also important as a recognition molecule (e.g. glycoproteins) and as
    a structural component (part of DNA / RNA)

Lipids

-   Non-polar, hydrophobic molecules which may come in a variety of
    forms (simple, complex or derived)
-   Lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes (phospholipids
    and cholesterol)
-   They may be utilised as a long-term energy storage molecule (fats
    and oils)
-   Also may function as a signalling molecule (steroids)

Nucleic Acids

-   Genetic material of all cells and determines the inherited features
    of an organism
-   DNA functions as a master code for protein assembly, while RNA plays
    an active role in the manufacturing of proteins

Proteins

-   Make over 50% of the dry weight of cells; are composed of C, H, O
    and N atoms (some may include S)Â 
-   Major regulatory molecules involved in catalysis (all enzymes are
    proteins)
-   May also function as structural molecules or play a role in cellular
    signalling (transduction pathways)

Carbohydrates

The structure of complex carbohydrates may vary depending on the
composition of monomeric subunits

Polysaccharides may differ according to the type of monosaccharide they
possess and the way the subunits bond together

-   Glucose monomers can be combined to form aÂ variety of different
    polymers â€“ including glycogen, cellulose and starch

Polymers of Glucose

[glucose polymers]

Lipids

Lipids can be roughly organised into one of three main classes:

-   Simple (neutral) lipids â€“ Esters of fatty acids and alcohol (e.g.
    triglycerides and waxes)
-   Compound lipids â€“ Esters of fatty acids, alcohol and additional
    groups (e.g. phospholipids and glycolipids)Â 
-   Derived lipids â€“ Substances derived from simple or compound lipids
    (e.g. steroids and carotenoids)

Three Main Types of Lipids

[lipid types]

Proteins

Amino acids join together by peptide bonds which form between the amine
and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids

The fusion of two amino acids creates a dipeptide, with further
additions resulting in the formation of a polypeptide chain

-   The subsequent folding of the chain depends on the order of amino
    acids in a sequence (based on chemical properties)

Formation of a Dipeptide

[dipeptide]

Nucleic Acids

Nucleotides form bonds between the pentose sugar and phosphate group to
form long polynucleotide chains

-   In DNA, two complementary chains will pair up via hydrogen bonding
    between nitrogenous bases to form double strands
-   This double stranded molecule may then twist to form a double
    helical arrangement

â€¢ Â Drawing molecular diagrams of glucose, ribose, a saturated fatty
acid and a generalised amino acid

Â  Â Â 
Complex macromolecules may commonly be comprised of smaller, recurring
subunits called monomers

-   Carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins are all comprised of
    monomeric subunits that join together to form larger polymers
-   Lipids do not contain recurring monomers, however certain types may
    be composed of distinct subunits (e.g. triglycerides)

Organic Monomers / Subunits

[organic subunits]

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are composed of monomers called monosaccharides ('single
sugar unit')

-   Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides (two sugar
    units) and polysaccharides (many sugar units)
-   Most monosaccharides form ring structures and can exist in different
    3D configurations (stereoisomers)

Examples of Common Monosaccharides

[monosaccharides]

Lipids

Lipids exist as many different classes that vary in structure and hence
do not contain a common recurring monomer

However several types of lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, waxes)
contain fatty acid chains as part of their overall structure

-   Fatty acids are long chains of hydrocarbons that may or may not
    contain double bonds (unsaturated vs saturated)

Structure of a Typical Fatty Acid (Saturated)

[fatty acid]

Proteins

Proteins are composed of monomers called amino acids, which join
together to form polypeptide chains

-   Each amino acid consists of a central carbon connected to an amine
    group (NH₂) and an opposing carboxyl group (COOH)
-   A variable group (denotedÂ â€˜Râ€™) gives different amino acids
    different properties (e.g. may be polar or non-polar, etc.)

Structure of a Generalised Amino Acid

[amino acid]

Nucleic Acids

Nucleic acids are composed of monomers called nucleotides, which join
together to form polynucleotide chains

Each nucleotide consists of 3 components â€“ a pentose sugar, a
phosphate group and a nitrogenous base

-   The type of sugar and composition of bases differs between DNA and
    RNA

Periodic Table

[atom]

All substances, both living and non-living, are composed of matter

The fundamental unit of matter is the atom, which consists of:

-   Protons (+ve charge) and neutrons (no charge) within a central
    nucleus
-   Electrons (â€“ve charge) circling the nucleus in regions called
    orbitals

Different atoms will possess different chemical properties (how they
react)

Atoms can be grouped by properties and displayed according to a periodic
table

Periodic Table of Elements

[periodic table]

Atoms in the same group (columns)Â share chemical properties as they
have the same number of electrons in their outer shell

Atoms in the same period (rows) have the same number of electron shells
but do not share any consistent chemical properties

Atoms always have the same number of protons and electrons - when they
gain or lose electrons they become charged ions

An atom may have a different number of neutrons - these different forms
are called isotopes and can cause radioactive decay
Trace Elements

The most frequently occurring chemical elements in living things are
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen (C, H, O, N)

Trace elements (or mineral nutrients) are the other chemical elements
required by living things

[trace elements]

Biologically significant trace elements include:

Calcium (Ca) â€“ Important for neurotransmitter release from synapses

Iron (Fe) â€“ Found in haemoglobin and needed for oxygen transport

Sodium (Na) â€“ Involved in the generation of nerve impulses inÂ neurone

Phosphorus (P) â€“ Component of nucleic acids and cell membranes

Sulphur (S) â€“ Found in some amino acids, allows disulphide bonds to
form
Mnemonic: Â Cafe Naps

Summary of Biologically Important Trace Elements

[mineral nutrients]
Types of Bonding

Atoms always try to have a full outer shell of electrons - in order to
achieve this they will bond with other atoms

When atoms bond together they form molecules - those made of one type of
atom are elements while those made of many types are compounds

Intramolecular Bonds

Atoms may join together by gaining and losing electrons (ionic bonding)
or by sharing electrons (covalent bonding)
Ionic Bonds:

-   Ionic bonding occurs between a metal and a non-metal
-   The metal has a nearly empty outer shell and so loses electrons to
    form a positively charged cation
-   The non-metal has a nearly full outer shell and so gains electrons
    to form a negatively charged anion
-   The resulting charge of these two ions creates a strong
    electrostatic attraction between them - an ionic bond

[ionic bond]

Covalent Bonds:

-   Covalent bonding occurs between two non-metals
-   Because both atoms have a large number of electrons in their outer
    shell, it is not feasible to lose or gain so many and so they share
-   The number of covalent bonds able to be formed reflects the number
    of missing electrons from the outer shell (e.g. carbon needs four
    electrons and so can form four covalent bonds)
-   Because there is no ionic charge, covalent molecules are not as
    strongly attracted to each other as ionic molecules (covalent bonds
    are weaker)

[covalent bond]

Intermolecular Bonds

Atoms from one molecule may attract atoms from another molecule â€“
these bonds are much weaker than intramolecular bonds
Hydrogen Bonds:

-   The covalent sharing of electrons between atoms may not always be
    equal and will depend on:
    -   The number of protons in an atom (more protons equals a greater
        attraction for electrons)
    -   The number of electron shells in an atom (electrons at a further
        distance from the nucleus are less attracted to nucleus)
-   Atoms that have a stronger affinity for electrons are said to have a
    higher electronegativity
-   Covalently shared electrons will orbit closer to atoms with a higher
    electronegativity, resulting in a slight charge differenceÂ 
-   These molecules are polar and can form weak electrostatic
    associations with other polar molecules
-   Polar associations between an H atom of one molecule and an F, O or
    N atom of another molecule are called hydrogen bonds

Â  Â Â 
Water has the capacity to form intermolecular associations with
molecules that share common properties

Because water is polar it will be attracted to other molecules that are
polar or have an ionic charge

[cohesion versus adhesion]

Cohesive Properties:

-   Cohesion is the ability of like molecules to stick together
-   Water is strongly cohesive (it will form hydrogen bonds)

Adhesive Properties:

-   Adhesion is the ability of dissimilar molecules to stick together
-   Water will form intermolecular associations with polar and charged
    molecules

Significance of Cohesive and Adhesive Properties:

The cohesive properties of water explain its surface tensionÂ 

-   The hydrogen bonding between water molecules allows the liquid to
    resist low levels of external force (surface tension)
-   The high surface tension of water makes it sufficiently dense for
    certain smaller organisms to move along its surface

The adhesive properties of water explain its capillary action

-   Attraction to charged or polar surfaces (e.g. glass) allows water to
    flow in opposition of gravitational forces (capillary action)
-   This capillary action is necessary to allow water to be transported
    up plant stems via a transpiration stream

Hydrogen Bonding between Water Molecules

[hydrogen bonding]

Properties of Water

This intermolecular bonding between water molecules gives water distinct
properties not seen in other substances:

-   Thermal properties â€“ Water can absorb much heat before changing
    state (requires breaking of hydrogen bonds)
-   Cohesive / adhesive properties â€“ Water willÂ â€˜stickâ€™Â to other
    water molecules (cohesion) and charged substances (adhesion)

    (forms competing polar associations to draw materials apart)
Significance of Water

Water possesses many unique qualities that are essential to maintaining
viable living conditions

-   Approximately 70% of the cellâ€™s internal environment (i.e.
    cytoplasm) is water-based
-   It is the only substance occurring naturally in all three states
    (solid, liquid, gas) on the Earthâ€™s surface
-   It is required for the anabolic construction of organic molecules
    (via condensation reactions)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hydrogen bonding and dipolarity explain the cohesive, adhesive,
thermal and solvent properties of water

Â  Â Â 
Water is commonly referred to as the universal solvent due to its
capacity to dissolve a large number of substances

Water can dissolve any substance that contains charged particles (ions)
or electronegative atoms (polarity)

This occurs because the polar attraction of large quantities of water
molecules can sufficiently weaken intramolecular forces (such as ionic
bonds) and result in the dissociation of the atoms

The slightly charged regions of the water molecule surround atoms of
opposing charge, forming dispersive hydration shells

Solvent Properties of Water

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Substances can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic

Â  Â Â 
Substances that freely associate and readily dissolve in water are
characterised as hydrophilic (â€˜water lovingâ€™)

-   Hydrophilic substances include all polar molecules and ions

Substances that do not freely associate or dissolve in water are
characterised as hydrophobic (â€˜water-hatingâ€™)

-   Hydrophobic substances include large, non-polar molecules (such as
    fats and oils)

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Modes of transport of glucose, amino acids, cholesterol, fats,
oxygen and sodium chloride in blood inÂ 

Â  Â relationÂ to their solubility in water

Â  Â Â 
The transport of essential molecules within the bloodstream will depend
on their solubility in water

-   Water soluble substances will usually be able to travel freely in
    the blood plasma, whereas water insoluble substances cannot

Water Soluble Substances

-   Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound and its components (Na⁺
    and Cl^(â€“)) may be freely transported within the blood
-   Oxygen is soluble in water but in low amounts â€“ most oxygen is
    transported by haemoglobin within red blood cells
-   Glucose contains many hydroxyl groups (â€“OH) which may associate
    with water and thus can freely travel within the blood
-   Amino acids will be transported in the blood in an ionized state
    (either the amine and/or carboxyl groups may be charged)

Water Insoluble Substances

-   Lipids (fats and cholesterol) are non-polar and hydrophobic and
    hence will not dissolve in water
-   They form complexes with proteins (lipoproteins) in order to move
    through the bloodstream
-   Hydrophilic portions of proteins, cholesterol and phospholipids will
    face outwards and shield internal hydrophobic components

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hydrogen bonding and dipolarity explain the cohesive, adhesive,
thermal and solvent properties of water

Â  Â Â 
Water has the capacity to absorb significant amounts of heat before
changing state

-   This is due to the extensive hydrogen bonding between water
    molecules â€“ the H-bonds need to be broken before a change in state
    can occur and this requires the absorption of energy (heat)

Consequently, water is an excellent medium for living organisms as it is
relatively slow to change temperature and thus supports the maintenance
of constant conditions (internal and external)

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Comparison of the thermal properties of water with those of
methane

Â  Â Â 
Methane (CH₄) provides a good basis for comparison with water due to the
many similarities between their structures:

-   Comparable size and weight (H₂O = 18 dalton ; CH₄ = 16 dalton)
-   Comparable valence structures (both have tetrahedralÂ orbital
    formations, but water is bent due to unbonded electron pairs)Â 

Comparison of Water and Methane Molecules

[water versus methane]

Differences between Water and Methane

The differences in thermal properties between water and methane arise
from differences in polarity between the molecules:

-   Water is polar and can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds (due to
    high electronegativity of oxygen atom)
-   Methane is non-polar and can only form weak dispersion forces
    between its molecules (carbon has a lower electronegativity)

This means water absorbs more heat before changing state (each H-bond
has an average energy of 20 kJ/mol)

-   Water has a significantly higher melting and boiling point
-   Water has a higher specific heat capacity (energy required to raise
    the temperature of 1 g of substance by 1ÂºC)
-   Water has a higher heat of vaporisation (energy absorbed per gram as
    it changes from a liquid to a gas /Â vapour)
-   Water as a higher heat of fusion (energy required to be lost to
    change 1 g of liquid to 1 g of solid at 0ÂºC)

[water versus methane thermal table]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of water as a coolant in sweat

Â  Â Â 
The evaporation of water as sweat is a fundamental mechanism employed by
humans as a means of cooling down

-   The change of water from liquid to vapour (evaporation) requires an
    input of energy
-   This energy comes from the surface of the skin when it is hot,
    therefore when the sweat evaporates the skin is cooled
-   Because water has a high specific heat capacity, it absorbs a lot of
    thermal energy before it evaporates
-   Thus water functions as a highly effective coolant, making it the
    principal component of sweat
Water Cycle

The water (hydrologic) cycle describes the continuous movement of water
on, above and below the surface of the Earth

This movement of water involves several different processes, including:

-   Evaporation â€“ Water is converted to vapour by the sun and
    transferred from the Earthâ€™s surface to the atmosphere
-   Transpiration â€“ Water vapour is released by plants and soil into
    the atmosphere
-   Condensation â€“ Water vapour is transformed into liquid water
    droplets in the air (creating clouds and fog)
-   Precipitation â€“ Water vapour in the atmosphere condenses into
    liquid (rain) or solid (snow) and returns to the Earth
-   Infiltration â€“ The flow of water from the ground surface into the
    soil
-   Runoff â€“ The variety of ways water moves along the ground
-   Subsurface Flow â€“ The flow of water underground (will eventually
    drain into oceans or return to the surface via springs)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Water molecules are polar and hydrogen bonds form between them

Â  Â Â 
Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to an oxygen
atom (molecular formula = H₂O)

While this covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons, they are
not shared equally between the atoms

-   Oxygen (due to having a higher electronegativity) attracts the
    electrons more stronglyÂ 
-   The shared electrons orbit closer to the oxygen atom than the
    hydrogen atoms resulting in polarity

[water structure]

Water is described as being polar because it has a slight charge
difference across the different poles of the molecule

-   The oxygen atom is slightly negative (Î´^(â€“)) while the hydrogen
    atoms are slightly positiveÂ (Î´⁺)

This charge difference across the molecule (dipole) allows water to form
weak associations with other polar moleculesÂ 

-   The slightly negative polesÂ (Î´^(â€“))Â will attract the slightly
    positive polesÂ (Î´⁺)Â of other molecules, and vice versa

When aÂ Î´⁺Â hydrogen atom is attracted to aÂ Î´^(â€“)Â fluorine, oxygen
or nitrogen atom of another molecule, it forms a hydrogen bond

-   Hydrogen bonds are relatively stronger than other polar associations
    due to the high electronegativity of F, O and N

    problems in sedentary adults

Body mass index can be calculated according to the following formula:

[Screen Shot 2015-01-05 at 12.18.12 pm]

BMI ranges from underweight to obese, according to predetermined values

    professional athletes with atypical muscle / fat ratios
-   BMI calculations should not be used as a diagnostic tool and should
    be used in conjunction with other measurements

Standard Adult BMI Categories

[BMI categories]

Nomograms

An alternative way of calculating body mass index is by using an

Functions of Lipids

[ships]

Lipids can serve a diverse range of functions within a cell, including:

-   Storage of energy for long-term use (e.g. triglycerides)
-   Hormonal roles (e.g. steroids such as oestrogen and testosterone)
-   Insulation â€“ both thermal (triglycerides) and electrical

    and glycogen
-   Determination of body mass index by calculation or use of a nomogram
Lipid Absorption

Lipids within the digestive system will tend to hydrophobically
aggregate to form large fat globules

-   Bile salts, secreted from the gall bladder, emulsify these fat
    globules and break them up into smaller droplets
-   Hydrolytic enzymes calledÂ lipases then digest the fats into their
    component parts

When the fatty acids are absorbed into the epithelial cells of the
intestinal lining, they are combined to form triglycerides

-   The triglycerides are combined with proteins inside the Golgi
    apparatus to form chylomicrons
-   Chylomicrons are released from the epithelial cells and are
    transported via the lacteals to the liver

While in the liver, chylomicrons may be modified to form a variety of
lipoproteins

-   Low density lipoproteins will transport lipids via the bloodstream
    to cells
-   High density lipoproteins will scavenge excess lipids from the
    bloodstream and tissues and return them to the liver

Â  Â Â 
Types of Fats

Whilst all types of fats consumed as part of dietary intake will cause
adverse health effects if taken in excessive amounts, some types of fats
are associated with increased health risks

The mix of fats in the diet influences the level of cholesterol in the
bloodstream

Saturated fats and trans fats raise blood cholesterol levels, while
(cis) unsaturated fats lower blood cholesterol levels

Comparison of Main Types of Fatty Acids

[saturated trans fats]

Regulating Blood Cholesterol Levels

Fats and cholesterol cannot dissolve in blood and are consequently
packaged with proteins (to form lipoproteins) for transport

-   Low density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to
    the rest of the body
-   High density lipoproteins (HDL) scavenge excess cholesterol and
    carry it back to the liver for disposal

Hence LDLs raise blood cholesterol levels (â€˜badâ€™) while HDLs lower
blood cholesterol levels (â€˜goodâ€™)
High intakes of certain types of fats will differentially affect
cholesterol levels in the blood

-   Saturated fats increase LDL levels within the body, raising blood
    cholesterol levels
-   Trans fats increase LDL levelsÂ and decrease HDLÂ levels within the
    body, significantly raising blood cholesterol levels
-   Unsaturated (cis) fats increase HDLÂ levels within the body,
    lowering blood cholesterol levels

Effect of Different Types of Fats on Cholesterol Levels

[lipoprotein and cholesterol]

Health Risks of High Cholesterol

High cholesterol levels in the bloodstream lead to the hardening and
narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis)

When there are high levels of LDL in the bloodstream, the LDL particles
will form deposits in the walls of the arteries

The accumulation of fat within the arterial walls lead to the
development of plaques which restrict blood flow

If coronary arteries become blocked, coronary heart disease (CHD) will
result â€“ this includes heart attacks and strokes Â

Application:

â€¢ Â Evaluation of evidence and the methods used to obtain the evidence
for health claims made about lipids

Â  Â Â 
Lipid Health Claims

There are two main health claims made about lipids in the diet:

-   Diets rich in saturated fats and trans fats increase the risk of CHD
-   Diets rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated (cis) fats
    decrease the risk of CHD

These health claims are made based on evidence collected in a number of
ways:

-   Epidemiological studies comparing different population groups
-   Intervention studies that monitor cohorts following dietary
    modifications
-   Experimental designs utilising animal models or data based on
    autopsies

Evidence Supporting Health Claims

A positive correlation has been found between the intake of saturated
fats and the incidence of CHD in human populations

-   Counter: Certain populations do not fit this trend (e.g. the Maasai
    tribe in Africa have a fat-rich diet but very low rates of CHD)

Intervention studies have shown that lowering dietary intakes of
saturated fats reduces factors associated with the development of CHD
(e.g. blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.)

-   Counter: Validity of intervention studies is dependent on size and
    composition of cohort, as well as the duration of the study

In patients who died from CHD, fatty deposits in diseased arteries were
found to contain high concentrations of trans fats

-   Counter: Genetic factors may play a role (e.g. blood cholesterol
    levels only show a weak association to dietary levels)

Evidence Against Health Claims

Proportion of saturated and trans fats in Western diets has decreased
over the last 50 years, but incidence of CHD has risen

-   Counter: Increased carbohydrate intake may cause detrimental health
    effects associated with CHD (e.g. diabetes, obesity)
-   Counter: Incidence of CHD dependent on a myriad of factors besides
    dietary intake (e.g. exercise, access to health care, etc.)Â 

Summary of Types of Dietary Fats

[dietary fats]
Lipoproteins

Lipids are insoluble in water and need to formÂ complexes with proteins
(lipoproteins) in order to be transported in the blood

Different classes of lipoprotein carry variable amounts of the different
types of fats (phospholipid, triglycerides, cholesterol)

-   Chylomicrons are produced in the intestine and conduct fats to the
    liver, skeletal muscles and adipose tissue via the lacteals
-   Low density lipoproteins (LDLs) carry fat around the entire body
    within the bloodstream
-   High density lipoproteins (HDLs) collect fat from cells and tissues
    and return it to the liverÂ 
-   Very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and intermediate density
    lipoproteins (IDLs) exist as transitional forms between chylomicrons
    and LDLs

Application:

â€¢ Â Structure and function of cellulose and starch in plants and
glycogen in humans

Â  Â Â 
Polysaccharides are carbohydrate polymers comprised of many (hundreds to
thousands) monosaccharide monomers

The type of polymer formed depends on the monosaccharide subunits
involved and the bonding arrangement between them

Three key polymers can be made from glucose monosaccharides â€“
cellulose, starch (in plants) and glycogen (in animals)

Cellulose

Cellulose is a structural polysaccharide that is found in the cell wall
of plants

It is a linear molecule composed ofÂ Î²-glucose subunits (bound in a 1-4
arrangement)

Because it is composed ofÂ Î²-glucose, it is indigestible for most
animals (lack the enzyme required to break it down)

-   Ruminants (e.g. cows) may digest cellulose due to the presence of
    helpful bacteria in a specialised stomach
-   Caecotrophs (e.g. rabbits) will re-ingest specialised faeces that
    contain digested cellulose (broken down in the caecum)

Starch

Starch is an energy storage polysaccharide found in plants

It is composed ofÂ Î±-glucose subunits (bound in a 1-4 arrangement) and
exists in one of two forms â€“ amylose or amylopectin

-   Amylose is a linear (helical) molecule while amylopectin is branched
    (contains additional 1-6 linkages)
-   Amylose is harder to digest and less soluble, however, as it takes
    up less space, is the preferred storage form in plants

Glycogen

Glycogen is an energy storage polysaccharide formed in the liver in
animals

It is composed ofÂ Î±-glucose subunits linked together by both 1-4
linkages and 1-6 linkages (branching)

-   It is akin to amylopectin in plants, but is more highly branched
    (1-6 linkages occur every ~10 subunits as opposed to ~20)

Â  Â Â 
Carbohydrates are made of C, H and O (â€˜carboâ€™Â â€“ contains carbon
;Â â€˜hydrateâ€™Â â€“ contains H and O)

Carbohydrates are composed of recurring monomers called monosaccharides
(which typically form ring structures)

These monosaccharides may be linked together via condensation reactions
(water is formed as a by-product)

-   Two monosaccharide monomers may be joined via a glycosidic linkage
    to form a disaccharide
-   Many monosaccharide monomers may be joined via glycosidic linkages
    to form polysaccharides

Formation of a Disaccharide

[disaccharide]

Examples of Carbohydrates

Monosaccharides (one sugar unit) are typically sweet-tasting and
function as an immediate energy source for cells

-   Examples of monosaccharides include glucose, galactose and fructose

Disaccharides (two sugar units) are small enough to be soluble in water
and commonly function as a transport form

-   Examples of disaccharides include lactose, maltose and sucrose

Polysaccharides (many sugar units) may be used for energy storage or
cell structure, and also play a role in cell recognition

-   Examples of polysaccharides include cellulose, glycogen and starch

Lipids and carbohydrates both function as energy storage molecules in
humans, however differ in several key aspects:

-   Storage (lipids are more suitable for long-term energy storage)
-   Osmolality (lipids have less of an effect on the osmotic pressure of
    a cell)
-   Digestion (carbohydrates are easier to digest and utilise)
-   ATP Yield (lipids store more energy per gram)

Energy Storage Comparison (Carbohydrates vs Lipids)

[energy storage]

Energy Storage Analogy

ATP is the energy currency of the cell â€“ in this respect it is akin to
cash

-   Cash is earned when you work (cell respiration) and can be spent in
    a number of ways (metabolism)

Storing energy as carbohydrates (i.e. glycogen) is similar to keeping
the cash in a wallet

-   It is easier to carry around (monosaccharides and disaccharides are
    water soluble)
-   It is readily accessible (carbohydrates are easier to digest)
-   You cannot carry as much (carbohydrates store less energy per gram)

Storing energy as lipids (i.e. triglycerides) is similar to keeping the
cash in a safe

-   It is not viable to carry around (triglycerides are insoluble in
    water)
-   It is harder to access (triglycerides cannot be easily digested)
-   You can keep more cash in it (triglycerides store more energy per
    gram)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Triglycerides are formed by condensation from three fatty acids
and one glycerol

Â  Â Â 
Triglycerides are the largest class of lipids and function primarily as
long-term energy storage molecules

-   Animals tend to store triglycerides as fats (solid), while plants
    tend to store triglycerides as oils (liquid)

Triglycerides are formed when condensation reactions occur between one
glycerol and three fatty acids

-   The hydroxyl groups of glycerol combine with the carboxyl groups of
    the fatty acids to form an ester linkage
-   This condensation reaction results in the formation of three
    molecules of water

Triglycerides can be either saturated or unsaturated, depending on the
composition of the fatty acid chains

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fatty acids can be saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated

Â  Â Â 
Fatty acids are long hydrocarbon chains that are found in certain types
of lipids (triglycerides & phospholipids)

-   Fatty acids may differ in the length of the hydrocarbon chain
    (typically 4 â€“ 24 carbons) and in the number of double bonds

Fatty acids that possessÂ noÂ double bonds areÂ saturatedÂ (have maximum
number of H atoms)

-   Saturated fatty acids are linear in structure, originate from animal
    sources (i.e. fats) and are typically solid at room temperatures

Fatty acids with double bonds are unsaturated â€“ either monounsaturated
(1 double bond) or polyunsaturated (>1 double bond)

-   Unsaturated fatty acids are bent in structure, originate from plant
    sources (i.e. oils) and are typically liquid at room temperatures

Types of Fatty Acids

[saturated vs unsaturated]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Unsaturated fatty acids can be cis or trans isomers

Â  Â Â 
Unsaturated fatty acids may occur in two distinct structural
configurations â€“ cis and trans isomers

Cis: The hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon double bond are on the
same side

Trans: The hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon double bond are on
different sides
Trans fatty acids do not commonly occur in nature and are typically
produced by an industrial process called hydrogenation

Trans fatty acids are generally linear in structure (despite being
unsaturated) and are usually solid at room temperature

Types of Fatty Acid Configurations

[types of fatty acids]
Amino Acid Polarity

Amino acids may be either polar or non-polar depending on the
composition of their side chain

-   Polar amino acids have hydrophilic R groups, while non-polar amino
    acids have hydrophobic R groups

The localisation of polar and non-polar amino acids will be determined
by the type of protein and its function:
Water soluble proteins:

-   Non-polar amino acids tend to be found in the centre of the molecule
    (stabilise the structure)
-   Polar amino acids tend to be located on the protein surface (capable
    of interacting with water molecules)

Membrane-bound proteins:

-   Non-polar amino acids tend to be located on the regions of the
    surface in contact with the membrane
-   Polar amino acids will generally line interior pores (to create
    hydrophilic channels)

Enzymes:

-   The active site specifically depends on the location and
    distribution of polar and non-polar amino acids as hydrophobic and
    hydrophilic interactions can play a role in substrate binding to the
    active site

Amino acids all share a common basic structure, with a central carbon
atom bound to:

-   An amine group (NH₂)
-   A carboxylic acid group (COOH)
-   A hydrogen atom (H)
-   A variable side chain (R)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Amino acids can be linked together in any sequence giving a huge
range of possible polypeptides

Â  Â Â 
Amino acids are joined together on the ribosome to form long chains
called polypeptides, which make up proteins

Each type of amino acid differs in the composition of the variable side
chain

These side chains will have distinct chemical properties (e.g. charged,
non-polar, etc.) and hence cause the protein to fold and function
differently according to its specific position within the polypeptide
chain

As most natural polypeptide chains contain between 50 â€“ 2000 amino
acid residues, organisms are capable of producing a huge range of
possible polypeptides

Application:

â€¢ Â Denaturation of proteins by heat or by deviation of pH from the
optimum

Â  Â Â 
Denaturation is a structural change in a protein that results in the
loss (usually permanent) of its biological properties

-   Because the way a protein folds determines its function, any change
    or abrogation of the tertiary structure will alter its activity

Denaturation of proteins can usually be caused by two key conditions â€“
temperature and pH

Denaturation of a Protein

[denaturation]

Temperature

-   High levels of thermal energy may disrupt the hydrogen bonds that
    hold the protein together
-   As these bonds are broken, the protein will begin to unfold and lose
    its capacity to function as intended
-   Temperatures at which proteins denature may vary, but most human
    proteins function optimally at body temperature (~37ÂºC)

pH

-   Amino acids are zwitterions, neutral molecules possessing both
    negatively (COO^(â€“)) and positively (NH₃⁺) charged regionsÂ 
-   Changing the pH will alter the charge of the protein, which in turn
    will alter protein solubility and overall shape
-   All proteins have an optimal pH which is dependent on the
    environment in which it functions (e.g. stomach proteins require an
    acidic environment to operate, whereas blood proteins function best
    at a neutral pH)

Effect of pH on Protein Structure

Fibrous vs Globular Proteins

There are two main classes of protein tertiary structure:

-   Fibrous proteins are generally composed of long and narrow strands
    and have a structural role (they are something)
-   Globular proteins generally have a more compact and rounded shape
    and have functional roles (they do something)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The amino acid sequence of polypeptides is coded for by genes

Â  Â Â 
A gene is a sequence of DNA which encodes a polypeptide sequence

A gene sequence is converted into a polypeptide sequence via two
processes:

-   Transcription â€“ making an mRNA transcript based on a DNA template
    (occurs within the nucleus)
-   Translation â€“ using the instructions of the mRNA transcript to
    link amino acids together (occurs at the ribosome)

Typically, one gene will code for one polypeptide â€“ however there are
exceptions to this rule:

-   Genes may be alternatively spliced to generate multiple polypeptide
    variants
-   Genes encoding tRNA sequences are transcribed but never translated
-   Genes may be mutated (their base sequence is changed) and

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The amino acid sequence determines the three-dimensional
conformation of a protein

Â  Â Â 
Amino acids are covalently joined via peptide bonds to form long chains
called polypeptides

The order of the amino acid sequence is called the primary structure and
determines the way the chain will fold

-   Different amino acid sequences will fold into different
    configurations due to the chemical properties of the variable side
    chains

Amino acid sequences will commonly fold into two stable configurations,
called secondary structures

-   Alpha helices occur when the amino acid sequence folds into a coil /
    spiral arrangement
-   Beta-pleated sheets occur when the amino acid sequence adopts a
    directionally-oriented staggered strand conformation

BothÂ Î±-helices andÂ Î²-pleated sheets result from hydrogen bonds
forming between non-adjacent amine and carboxyl groups

-   Where no secondary structure exists, the polypeptide chain will form
    a random coil

Secondary Structure â€“ Alpha Helices versus Beta Pleated Sheets

[secondary structure]

The overall three-dimensional configuration of the protein isÂ referred
to as theÂ tertiary structureÂ of the protein

The tertiary structure of a polypeptide chain will be determined by the
interactions between the variable side chains

-   These interactions may include hydrogen bonds, disulphide bridges,
    ionic interactions, polar associations, etc.

The affinity or repulsion of side chains will affect the overall shape
of the polypeptide chain and are determined by the position of specific
amino acids within a sequence

-   Hence, the order of the amino acid sequence (primary structure)
    determines all subsequent levels of protein folding

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Every individual has a unique proteome

Â  Â Â 
The proteome is the totality of proteins expressed within a cell, tissue
or organism at a certain time

-   The proteome of any given individual will be unique, as protein
    expression patterns are determined by an individualâ€™sÂ genes

The proteome is always significantly larger than the number of genes in
an individual due to a number of factors:

-   Gene sequences may be alternatively spliced following transcription
    to generate multiple protein variants from a single gene
-   Proteins may be modified (e.g. glycosylated, phosphorylated, etc.)
    following translation to promote further variations

The pH Scale

pH stands forÂ theÂ â€˜power of hydrogenâ€™Â and represents the
concentration of hydrogen ions in a water-based solution

-   pH is expressed on a logarithmic scale, whereby pH = â€“log₁₀c Â (c
    = concentration of H⁺ in moles per litre)Â 

The pH scale typically ranges from 0 â€“ 14 and measures how acidic or
basic a substance is

-   Substances with a pH less than 7 are acidic and will donate hydrogen
    ions (i.e. high H⁺ concentration)
-   Substances with a pH greater than 7 are basic / alkaline and will
    accept hydrogen ions (i.e. high OH^(â€“) concentration)
-   Substances with a pH of 7 are neutral (there is an equal number of
    H⁺ and OH^(â€“) ions)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Temperature, pH and substrate concentration affect the rate of
activity of enzymes

Â  Â Â 
Various factors may affect the activity of enzymes, by either affecting
the frequency of enzyme-substrate collisions or by affecting the
capacity for the enzyme and substrate to interact (e.g. denaturation)

-   Temperature, pH and substrate concentration will all influence the
    rate of activity of an enzyme

Temperature

-   Low temperatures result in insufficient thermal energy for the
    activation of an enzyme-catalysed reaction to proceed
-   Increasing the temperature will increase the speed and motion of
    both enzyme and substrate, resulting in higher enzyme activity
-   This is because a higher kinetic energy will result in more frequent
    collisions between the enzymes and substrates
-   At an optimal temperature (may vary for different enzymes), the rate
    of enzyme activity will be at its peak
-   Higher temperatures will cause enzyme stability to decrease, as the
    thermal energy disrupts the enzymeâ€™sÂ hydrogen bonds
-   This causes the enzyme (particularly the active site) to lose its
    shape, resulting in the loss of activity (denaturation)

The Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Activity

[enzyme temperature]

pH

-   Changing the pH will alter the charge of the enzyme, which in turn
    will alter protein solubility and overall shape
-   Changing the shape or charge of the active site will diminish its
    ability to bind the substrate, abrogating enzyme function
-   Enzymes have an optimal pH (may differ between enzymes) and moving
    outside this range diminishes enzyme activity

The Effect of pH on Enzyme Activity

[enzyme pH]

Substrate Concentration

-   Increasing substrate concentration will increase the activity of a
    corresponding enzyme
-   More substrates mean there is an increased chance of enzyme and
    substrate colliding and reacting within a given period
-   After a certain point, the rate of activity will cease to rise
    regardless of any further increases in substrate levels
-   This is because the environment is saturated with substrate and all
    enzymes are bound and reacting (V_(max))

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzyme catalysis involves molecular motion and the collision of
substrates with the active site

Â  Â Â 
Enzyme reactions typically occur in aqueous solutions (e.g. cytoplasm,
interstitial fluid, etc.)

-   Consequently, the substrate and enzyme are usually moving randomly
    within the solution (Brownian motion)
-   Sometimes an enzyme may be fixed in position (e.g. membrane-bound)
    â€“ this serves to localise reactions to particular sites

Enzyme Catalysis

Enzyme catalysis requires that the substrate be brought into close
physical proximity with the active site

-   When a substrate binds to the enzymeâ€™s active site, an
    enzyme-substrate complex is formed
-   The enzyme catalyses the conversion of the substrate into product,
    creating an enzyme-product complex
-   The enzyme and product then dissociate â€“ as the enzyme was not
    consumed, it can continue to catalyse further reactionsÂ 

Enzyme-Substrate Interactions

[enzyme-substrate]

Collision Frequency

The rate of enzyme catalysis can be increased by improving the frequency
of collisions via:

-   Increasing the molecular motion of the particles (thermal energy can
    be introduced to increase kinetic energy)
-   Increasing the concentration of particles (either substrate or
    enzyme concentrations)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Design of experiments to test the effect of temperature, pH and
substrate concentration on the

Â  Â activity of enzymes

Â  Â Â 
When designing an experiment to test the effect of factors affecting
enzyme activity, the three key decisions to be made are:

-   Which factor to investigate (i.e. the independent variable)
-   Which enzyme / substrate reaction to use
-   How to measure the enzyme activity (i.e. the dependent variable)

Choosing the Independent Variable

The main factors which will affect the activity of an enzyme on a given
substrate are:

-   Temperature (use water baths to minimise fluctuations)
-   pH (acidic or alkaline solutions)
-   Substrate concentration (choose range to avoid saturation)
-   Presence of inhibitor (type of inhibitor will be enzyme-specific)

Selecting an Enzyme and Substrate

Selection will depend onÂ availability within the school, however
certain enzymes can be extracted from common food sources

Examples of common enzyme-catalysed reactions include:

[enzyme table 1]

Measuring Enzyme Activity

The method of data collection will depend on the reaction occurring â€“
typically most reactions are measured according to:

-   The amount / rate of substrate decomposition (e.g. breakdown of
    starch)
-   The amount / rate of product formation (e.g. formation of maltose)

[enzyme table 2]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Experimental investigation of a factor affecting enzyme activity

Â  Â Â 
Key things to consider when conducting an experimental investigation
into a factor affecting enzyme activity include:

-   What is an appropriate range of values to select for your
    independent variable?
-   Have you chosen a sufficient time period for the reaction to
    proceed?
-   Have you identified, and controlled, all relevant extraneous
    variables?
-   Can you include a negative control condition (no enzyme) to
    establish baseline readings?
-   Can you include a positive control condition to confirm enzyme
    activity?
-   Is it possible to treat the enzyme with the independent variable
    before mixing with the substrate?
-   Does the data collection method allow for sufficient precision in
    detecting changes to levels of product / substrate?
-   Have all appropriate safety precautions been taken when handling
    relevant substances?

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Immobilised enzymes are widely used in industry

Â  Â Â 
Immobilised enzymes have been fixed to a static surface in order to
improve the efficiency of the catalysed reaction

-   Enzyme concentrations are conserved as the enzyme is not dissolved
    â€“ hence it can be retained for reuse
-   Separation of the product is more easily achieved as the enzyme
    remains attached to the static surface

Immobilised enzymes are utilised in a wide variety of industrial
practices:

-   Biofuels â€“ Enzymes are used to breakdown carbohydrates to produce
    ethanol-based fuels
-   MedicineÂ â€“ Enzymes are used to identify a range of conditions,
    including certain diseases and pregnancy
-   Biotechnology â€“ Enzymes are involved in a number of processes,
    including gene splicing
-   Food production â€“ Enzymes are used in the production and
    refinement of beers and dairy products
-   Textiles â€“ Enzymes are utilised in the processing of fibres (e.g.
    polishing cloth)
-   Paper â€“ Enzymes assist in the pulping of wood for paper production

Common Industrial Uses of Enzymes

Application:

â€¢ Â Methods of production of lactose-free milk and its advantages

Â  Â Â 
Lactose is a disaccharide of glucose and galactose which can be broken
down by the enzyme lactase

Historically, mammals exhibit a marked decrease in lactase production
after weaning, leading to lactose intolerance

-   Incidence of lactose intolerance is particularly high in Asian,
    African and Aboriginal populations
-   Incidence is lower in European populations (due to a mutation that
    maintains lactase production into adulthood)

Breakdown of Lactose by the Enzyme Lactase

[lactose]

Producing Lactose-Free Milk

Lactose-free milk can be produced by treating the milk with the enzyme
lactase

-   The lactase is purified from yeast or bacteria and then bound to an
    inert substance (such as alginate beads)
-   Milk is then repeatedly passed over this immobilised enzyme,
    becoming lactose-free

Scientists are currently attempting to create transgenic cows that
produce lactose-free milk

-   This involves splicing the lactase gene into the cowâ€™s genome so
    that the lactose is broken down prior to milking

Generation of Lactose-Free Milk Using Immobilised Enzymes

[lactose-free milk]

Advantages of Lactose-Free Dairy Products

The generation of lactose-free milk can be used in a variety of ways:

-   As a source of dairy for lactose-intolerant individuals
-   As a means of increasing sweetness in the absence of artificial
    sweeteners (monosaccharides are sweeter tasting)
-   As a way of reducing the crystallisation of ice-creams
    (monosaccharides are more soluble, less likely to crystalise)
-   As a means of reducing production time for cheeses and yogurts
    (bacteria ferment monosaccharides more readily)
Enzyme Specificity

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes can be denatured

Â  Â Â 
All enzymes possess an indentation or cavity to which the substrate can
bind with high specificity â€“ this is the active site

-   The shape and chemical properties of the active site are highly
    dependent on the tertiary structure of the enzyme

Like all proteins, enzyme structure can be modified by external factors
such as high temperatures and extreme pH

-   These factors disrupt the chemical bonds which are necessary to
    maintain the tertiary structure of the enzyme
-   Any change to the structure of the active site (denaturation) will
    negatively affect the enzymeâ€™s capacity to bind the substrate

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes have an active site to which specific substrates bind

Â  Â Â 
An enzyme is a globular protein which acts as a biological catalyst by
speeding up the rate of a chemical reaction

Enzymes are not changed or consumed by the reactions they catalyse and
thus can be reused

Enzymes are typically named after the molecules they react with (called
the substrate) and end with the suffixÂ â€˜-aseâ€™

-   For example, lipids are broken down by the enzyme lipase

Active Site

The active site is the region on the surface of the enzyme which binds
to the substrate molecule

The active site and the substrate complement each other in terms of both
shape and chemical properties

-   Hence only a specific substrate is capable of binding to a
    particular enzymeâ€™s active site

Lactose Intolerance

Lactose is a disaccharide that is produced in lactating mammals as an
energy source for newborns

-   Lactose is digested into glucose and galactose by the enzyme lactase
    â€“ this occurs within the small intestine

As mammals typically only intake milk as part of the weaning process,
the production of lactase typically decreases after infancy

-   Without lactase, lactose will pass intact into the large intestine,
    where it is broken down by probiotic bacteria

As part of the bacterial fermentation process, large amounts of gas are
produced

-   This leads to the various ailments associated with lactose
    intolerance â€“ including abdominal bloating, cramps and flatulence

A proportion of the human population possess a mutation that maintains
lactase production in adulthood

The Role of Lactase and Lactose Intolerance

[lactose intolerance]
Models of Action

There are two models used to describe the way enzymes interact with
substrates:

-   The 'lock and keyâ€™Â model
-   TheÂ â€˜induced fitâ€™Â model

The Lock and Key Model

According to the lock and key model, the enzymeâ€™s active site
complements the substrate precisely

The substrate fits a particular active site like a key fits into a
particular lock

This theory of enzyme-substrate interaction explains how enzymes exhibit
specificity for a particular substrate

[enzyme-substrate]

The Induced Fit Model

According to the induced fit model, the enzymeâ€™s active site is not a
completely rigid fit for the substrate

Instead, the active site will undergo a conformational change when
exposed to a substrate to improve binding

This theory of enzyme-substrate interactions has two advantages compared
to the lock and key model:

-   It explains how enzymes may exhibit broad specificity (e.g. lipase
    can bind to a variety of lipids)
-   It explains how catalysis may occur (the conformational change
    stresses bonds in the substrate, increasing reactivity)

[induced fit]
The pH Scale

pH stands forÂ theÂ â€˜power of hydrogenâ€™Â and represents the
concentration of hydrogen ions in a water-based solution

-   pH is expressed on a logarithmic scale, whereby pH =
    â€“log₁₀cÂ Â (cÂ = concentration of H⁺Â in moles per litre)Â 

The pH scale typically ranges from 0 â€“ 14 and measures how acidic or
basic a substance is

-   Substances with a pH less than 7 are acidic and will donate hydrogen
    ions (i.e. high H⁺Â concentration)
-   Substances with a pH greater than 7 are basic / alkaline and will
    accept hydrogen ions (i.e. high OH^(â€“)Â concentration)
-   Substances with a pH of 7 are neutral (there is an equal number of
    H⁺Â and OH^(â€“)Â ions)

â€¢ Â DNA is a double helix molecule made of two antiparallel strands of
nucleotides linked by hydrogen bonding

Â  Â between complementary base pairs

Â  Â Â 
Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotide monomers which are linked into
a single strand via condensation reactions

-   The phosphate group of one nucleotide attaches to the sugar of
    another nucleotide (at the 3â€™â€“ hydroxyl (-OH) group)
-   This results in a phosphodiester bond forming between the two
    nucleotides (and water is produced as a by-product)
-   Successive condensation reactions result in the formation of long
    polynucleotide strands

Two polynucleotide chains of DNA are held together via hydrogen bonding
between complementary nitrogenous bases

-   Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) via two hydrogen bonds
-   Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) via three hydrogen bonds

In order for the bases to be facing each other and thus able to pair,
the strands must be running in opposite directionsÂ 

-   The two strands of DNA are described as being antiparallel

As the antiparallel chains lengthen, the atoms will organise themselves
into the most stableÂ energy configurationÂ Â 

-   This atomic arrangement results in the double-stranded DNA forming a
    double helix (~10 â€“ 15 bases per twist)

There are two types of nucleicÂ acids present in cells â€“ DNA and RNA

-   DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a more stable double stranded form
    that stores the genetic blueprint for cells

    specific polypeptide
-   Transfer RNA (tRNA) â€“ carries the polypeptide subunits (amino
    acids) to the organelle responsible for synthesis (ribosome)

Application:

â€¢ Â Crick and Watsonâ€™s elucidation of the structure of DNA using
model making

Â  Â Â 
The structural organisation of the DNA molecule was correctly proposed
in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick

-   These British scientists constructed models to quickly visualise and
    assess the viability of potential structures

Their efforts were guided by an understanding of molecular distances and
bond angles developed by Linus Pauling, and were based upon some key
experimental discoveries:

-   DNA is composed of nucleotides made up of a sugar, phosphate and
    base â€“ Phoebus Levene, 1919
-   DNA is composed of an equal number of purines (A + G) and
    pyrimidines (C + T) â€“ Erwin Chargaff, 1950
-   DNA is organised into a helical structure â€“ Rosalind Franklin,
    1953Â  (data shared without permission)

Making DNA Models

Using trial and error, Watson and Crick were able to assemble a DNA
model that demonstrated the following:

-   DNA strands are antiparallel and form a double helix
-   DNA strands pair via complementary base pairing (A = T ; CÂ Îž G)
-   Outer edges of bases remain exposed (allows access to replicative
    and transcriptional proteins)

As Watson and Crickâ€™s model building was based on trial and error, a
number of early models possessed faults:

-   The first model generated was a triple helix
-   Early models had bases on the outside and sugar-phosphate residues
    in the centre
-   Nitrogenous bases were not initially configured correctly and hence
    did not demonstrate complementarity

The Rosalind Franklin Controversy

The final construction of a correct DNA molecule owed heavily to the
X-ray crystallography data generated by Franklin

-   This data confirmed the arrangement of the DNA strands into a
    helical structure
-   The data was shared without Franklinâ€™s knowledge or permission and
    contributed profoundly to the final design
-   Hence, Franklin is now recognised as a key contributor to the
    elucidation of DNA structure

Central Dogma

The central dogma of molecular biology explains the flow of genetic
information within a cell

-   DNA codes for RNA via the process of transcription (occurs within
    the nucleus)
-   RNA codes for protein via the process of translation (occurs at the
    ribosomes)

This information flow was always considered to be uni-directional:
Â DNAÂ â†’ RNAÂ â†’ Protein
However in 1970 it was discovered that retroviruses could copy DNA from
an RNA sequence

-   These viruses possess an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that allows
    for reverse transcription to occur
-   Reverse transcription is now commonly used in scientific studies to
    establish gene expression profiles

The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

[central dogma]
Degeneracy

The genetic code has only ~20 amino acids but has 64 different codon
combinations

-   Consequently, the genetic code is said to show degeneracy â€“ more
    than one codon may code for a single amino acid

Due to the shape of the tRNA molecule, the third base of an anticodon is
not orientated optimally for base pairing

-   Consequently, this third base is less discriminatory towards
    complementary pairingÂ 
-   This is why degeneracy always occurs in the third base of a
    codonÂ (this site is known as the wobble position)

Degeneracy of the genetic code allows for the occurrence of silent
mutations â€“ whereby a change in the DNA sequence does not alter the
polypeptide sequence

â€¢ Â Helicase unwinds the double helix and separates the two strands by
breaking hydrogen bonds

â€¢ Â DNA polymerase links nucleotides together to form a new strand,
using the pre-existing strand as a template

Â  Â Â 
DNA replication is a semi-conservative process whereby pre-existing
strands act as templates for newly synthesised strands

The process of DNA replication is coordinated by two key enzymes
â€“Â helicase and DNA polymerase

Helicase

-   Helicase unwinds the double helix and separates the two
    polynucleotide strands
-   It does this by breaking the hydrogen bonds that exist between
    complementary base pairs
-   The two separated polynucleotide strands will act as templates for
    the synthesis of new complementary strands

DNA Polymerase

-   DNA polymerase synthesises new strands from the two parental
    template strands
-   Free deoxynucleoside triphosphates (nucleotides with 3 phosphate
    groups) align opposite their complementary base partner
-   DNA polymerase cleaves the two excess phosphates and uses the energy
    released to link the nucleotide to the new strand

polypeptide

â€¢ Â The amino acid sequence of polypeptides is determined by mRNA
according to the genetic code

Â  Â Â 
Codons

-   The base sequence of an mRNA molecule encodes the production of a
    polypeptide
-   The mRNA sequence is read by the ribosome in triplets of bases
    called codons
-   Each codon codes for one amino acid with a polypeptide chain
-   The order of the codons in an mRNA sequence determines the order of
    amino acids in a polypeptide chain

Genetic Code

-   The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded
    within mRNA sequences is converted into amino acid sequences
    (polypeptides) by living cells
-   The genetic code identifies the corresponding amino acid for each
    codon combination
-   As there are four possible bases in a nucleotide sequence, and three
    bases per codon, there are 64 codon possibilities (4³)
-   The coding region of an mRNA sequence always begins with a START
    codon (AUG) and terminates with a STOP codon

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of Taq DNA polymerase to produce multiple copies of DNA
rapidly by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Â  Â Â 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an artificial method of
replicating DNA under laboratory conditions

-   The PCR technique is used to amplify large quantities of a specific
    sequence of DNA from an initial minute sample
-   Each reaction doubles the amount of DNA â€“ a standard PCR sequence
    of 30 cycles creates over 1 billion copies (2³⁰)

The reaction occurs in a thermal cycler and uses variations in
temperature to control the replication process via three steps:

1.  Denaturation â€“ DNA sample is heated (~90ÂºC) to separate the two
    strands
2.  Annealing â€“ Sample is cooled (~55ÂºC) to allow primers to anneal
    (primers designate sequence to be copied)
3.  Elongation â€“ Sample is heated to the optimal temperature for a
    heat-tolerant polymerase (Taq) to function (~75ÂºC)

Taq polymerase is an enzyme isolated from the thermophilic bacterium
ThermusÂ aquaticus

-   As this enzymeâ€™s optimal temperature is ~75ÂºC, it is able to
    function at the high temperatures used in PCR without denaturing
-   Taq polymerase extends the nucleotide chain from the primers â€“
    therefore primers are used to select the sequence to be copied

Point Mutations

Point mutations are changes to one base in the DNA code and may involve
either:

-   The substitution of a base (e.g. ATG becomes ACG)
-   The insertion of a base (e.g. ATG becomes ATCG)
-   The deletion of a base (e.g. ATG becomes AG)
-   The inversion of bases (e.g. ATG becomes AGT)

Base substitutions may create either silent, missense or nonsense
mutations, while insertions and deletions cause frameshift mutations

Effects of Point Mutations

Silent mutations occur when the DNA change does not alter the amino acid
sequence of the polypeptide

-   This is possible because the genetic code is degenerate and certain
    codons may code for the same amino acid

Missense mutations occur when the DNA change alters a single amino acid
in the polypeptide chain

-   Sickle cell anaemia is an example of a disease caused by a single
    base substitution mutation (GAGÂ â†’ GTG ; GluÂ â†’ Val)

Nonsense mutations occur when the DNA change creates a premature STOP
codon which truncates the polypeptide

-   Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease which can result from a
    nonsense mutation (this may not be the only cause though)

Frameshift mutations occur when the addition or removal of a base alters
the reading frame of the gene

-   This change will affect every codon beyond the point of mutation and
    thus may dramatically change amino acid sequence

Semi-Conservative

List

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The replication of DNA is semi-conservative and depends on
complementary base pairing

Â  Â Â 
DNA replication is a semi-conservative process, because when a new
double-stranded DNA molecule is formed:

-   One strand will be from the original template molecule
-   One strand will be newly synthesised

Semi-Conservative DNA Molecule

[semi-conservative DNA]

This occurs because each nitrogenous base can only pair with its
complementary partner

-   Adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T)
-   Cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G)

Consequently, when DNA is replicated by the combined action of helicase
and DNA polymerase:

-   Each new strand formed will be identical to the original strand
    separated from the template
-   The two semi-conservative molecules formed will have an identical
    base sequence to the original molecule

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of Meselson and Stahlâ€™s results to obtain support for
the theory of semi-conservative replication of DNA

Â  Â Â 
The theory that DNA replication was semi-conservative was confirmed by
the Meselson-Stahl experiment in 1958

Prior to this experiment, three hypotheses had been proposed for the
method of replication of DNA:

-   Conservative Model â€“ An entirely new molecule is synthesised from
    a DNA template (which remains unaltered)
-   Semi-Conservative Model â€“ Each new molecule consists of one newly
    synthesised strand and one template strand
-   Dispersive Model â€“ New molecules are made of segments of new and
    old DNA

Three Proposed Models of DNA Replication

[Models of replication]

Meselson and Stahl were able to experimentally test the validity of
these three models using radioactive isotopes of nitrogen

-   Nitrogen is a key component of DNA and can exist as a heavier ¹⁵N or
    a lighter ¹⁴NÂ 

DNA molecules were prepared using the heavier ¹⁵N and then induced to
replicate in the presence of the lighter ¹⁴N

-   DNA samples were then separated via centrifugation to determine the
    composition of DNA in the replicated molecules

The results after two divisions supported the semi-conservative model of
DNA replication

-   After one division, DNA molecules were found to contain a mix of ¹⁵N
    and ¹⁴N, disproving the conservative model
-   After two divisions, some molecules of DNA were found to consist
    solely of ¹⁴N, disproving the dispersive model

â€¢ Â Deducing the DNA base sequence for the mRNA strand

Â  Â Â 
mRNAÂ â†’ DNA

mRNA is a complementary copy of a DNA segment (gene) and consequently
can be used to deduce the gene sequence

For converting a sequence from mRNA to the original DNA code, apply the
rules of complementary base pairing:

-   Cytosine (C) is replaced with Guanine (G) â€“ and viceÂ versa
-   Uracil (U) is replaced by Adenine (A)
-   Adenine (A) is replaced by Thymine (T)

â€¢ Â Use a table of mRNA codons and their corresponding amino acids to
deduce the sequence of amino acids

Â  Â coded by a short mRNA strand of known base sequence

Â  Â Â 
mRNAÂ â†’ Polypeptide

In order to translate an mRNA sequence into a polypeptide chain, it is
important to establish the correct reading frame

The mRNA transcript is organised into triplets of bases called codons,
and as such three different reading frames exists

-   An open reading frame starts with AUG and will continue in triplets
    to a termination codon
-   A blocked reading frame may be frequently interrupted by termination
    codons

Once the start codon (AUG) has been located and reading frame
established, the corresponding amino acid sequence can be deduced using
the genetic codeÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Transcription is the synthesis of mRNA copied from the DNA base
sequence by RNA polymerase

Â  Â Â 
Transcription is the process by which an RNA sequence is produced from a
DNA template

-   RNA polymerase separates the DNA strands and synthesises a
    complementary RNA copy from one of the DNA strands
-   When the DNA strands are separated, ribonucleosideÂ triphosphates
    align opposite their exposed complementary base partner
-   RNA polymerase removes the additional phosphate groups and uses the
    energy from this cleavage to covalently join the nucleotide to the
    growing sequence
-   Once the RNA sequence has been synthesised, RNA polymerase detaches
    from the DNA molecule and the double helix reforms

The Role of RNA Polymerase in Transcription

Gene

The sequence of DNA that is transcribed into RNA is called a gene

-   The strand that is transcribed is called the antisense strand and is
    complementary to the RNA sequenceÂ 
-   The strand that is not transcribed is called the sense strand and is
    identical to the RNA sequenceÂ (with T instead of U)

Transcription of genes occur in the nucleus (where DNA is), before the
RNA moves to the cytoplasm (for translation)

Translation Analogy

A cell is like a restaurant â€“ differentiated cell types are like
restaurants specialising in different cuisines

The DNA is the set of instructions for the cell â€“ like a cook book is
the set of instructions for a restaurant

A single DNA instruction is a gene â€“ this is akin to a single recipe

Transcription is the process of making an RNA copy of a gene â€“ RNA
polymerase is like a photocopy machine

The mRNA transcript (i.e. photocopied recipe) is transported to the
ribosome â€“ which functions as the cook

The ribosome reads the mRNA one codon at a time â€“ as a cook would read
the recipe one step at a time

Each codon corresponds to an amino acid â€“ just like each step in a
recipe refers to a specific ingredient

The amino acids are brought to the ribosome by tRNA â€“ these tRNA
molecules are like kitchen hands

The ribosome joins the amino acids together to make a polypeptide â€“
just like a cook mixes ingredients to make food

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Translation is the synthesis of polypeptides on ribosomes

â€¢ Â Translation depends on complementary base pairing between codons
on mRNA and anticodons on tRNA

Â  Â Â 
Translation is the process of protein synthesis in which the genetic
information encoded in mRNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids
on a polypeptide chain

-   Ribosomes bind to mRNA in the cytoplasm and move along the molecule
    in a 5â€™Â â€“ 3â€™Â direction until it reaches a start codon (AUG)
-   Anticodons on tRNA molecules align opposite appropriate codons
    according to complementary base pairing (e.g. AUG = UAC)
-   Each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid (according to the
    genetic code)
-   Ribosomes catalyse the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent
    amino acids (via condensation reactions)
-   The ribosome moves along the mRNA molecule synthesising a
    polypeptide chain until it reaches a stop codon
-   At this point translation ceases and the polypeptide chain is

Application:

â€¢ Â Production of human insulin in bacteria as an example of the
universality of the genetic code allowingÂ 

Â  Â for gene transfer between species

Â  Â Â 
The genetic code is universal â€“ almost every living organism uses the
same code (there are a few rare and minor exceptions)

-   As the same codons code for the same amino acids in all living
    things, genetic information is transferrable between species

The ability to transfer genes between species has been utilised to
produce human insulin in bacteria (for mass production)

-   The gene responsible for insulin production is extracted from a
    human cell
-   It is spliced into a plasmid vector (for autonomous replication and
    expression) before being inserted into a bacterial cell
-   The transgenic bacteria (typically E. coli) are then selected and
    cultured in a fermentation tank (to increase bacterial numbers)
-   The bacteria now produce human insulin, which is harvested, purified
    and packaged for human use (i.e. by diabetics)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Aerobic cell respiration requires oxygen and gives a large yield
of ATP from glucose

Â  Â Â 
Aerobic cell respiration requires the presence of oxygen and takes place
within the mitochondrion

Pyruvate is broken down into carbon dioxide and water, and a large
amount of ATP is produced (~34 â€“ 36 molecules)

Although aerobic respiration typically begins with glycolysisÂ in
carbohydrates, glycolysis itself is an anaerobic process

-   Aerobic respiration consists of the link reaction, citric acid cycle
    (or Krebs cycle) and the electron transport chain

Anaerobic Respiration

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Anaerobic cell respiration gives a small yield of ATP from glucose

Â  Â Â 
Both anaerobic and aerobic respiration pathways begin with the anaerobic
breakdown of glucoseÂ in the cytosolÂ by glycolysis
Glycolysis breaks down glucose (6-C) into two molecules of pyruvate
(3C), and also produces:

-   Hydrogen carriers (NADH) from an oxidised precursor (NAD⁺)
-   A small yield of ATP (net gain of 2 molecules)

Overview of Glycolysis

[glycolysis summary]

Anaerobic Respiration

Anaerobic respiration proceeds in the absence of oxygen and does not
result in the production of any further ATP molecules

-   In animals, the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid (or lactate)
-   In plants and yeasts, the pyruvate is converted into ethanol and
    carbon dioxideÂ 

The purpose of anaerobic respiration is to restore stocks of NAD⁺ â€“ as
this molecule is needed for glycolysis

-   By restoring stocks of NAD⁺ via anaerobic pathways, the organism can
    continue to produce ATP via glycolysis

The conversion of pyruvate into lactic acid (animals) or ethanol and CO₂
(plants / yeasts) is reversible

-   Hence, pyruvate levels can be restored once oxygen is present and a
    greater yield of ATP may be produced aerobically

Summary of Anaerobic Respiration

[anaerobic respiration]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Lactate production in humans when anaerobic respiration is used to
maximise the power of muscle contractions

Â  Â Â 
Muscle contractions require the expenditure of high amounts of energy
and thus require high levels of ATP

When exercising at high intensity, the cellsâ€™Â energy demands will
exceed what the available levels of O₂ can supply aerobically

-   Hence the body will begin breaking down glucose anaerobically to
    maximise ATP production

This will result in an increase in the production of lactic acid, which
leads to muscle fatigue

-   When the individual stops exercising, oxygen levels will increase
    and lactate will be converted back to pyruvate

Although carbohydrates, lipids and proteins can all be consumed as
energy sources, only carbohydrates will typically undergo anaerobic
respiration

The Effect of Exercise Intensity on Carbohydrate Consumption (and
Lactate Production)

[lactic acid graph]

The above graph demonstrates how the conditions of cell respiration
change with increasing energy demand

-   At high intensities, the aerobic consumption of fats is decreased
    while the anaerobic consumption of sugars increases
-   Consequently, lactate levels will increase at higher levels of
    exercise intensity
Anaerobic vs Aerobic

Both aerobic and anaerobic respiration uses the oxidation of organic
molecules to synthesis ATP
However there are several key differences between the two processes,
including:

-   Overall energy yield
-   Products formed
-   Location of processes

Cell respiration is the controlled release of energy from organic
compounds to produce ATP

-   The main organic compound used for this process is carbohydrates
    (glucose), although lipids and proteins can also be digested

There are two main types of cell respiration:

-   Anaerobic respiration involves the partial breakdown of glucose in
    the cytosol for a small yield of ATP
-   Aerobic respiration utilises oxygen to completely break down glucose
    in the mitochondria for a larger ATP yield

Cell Respiration Equation (Complete Breakdown)

[respiration equation]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â ATP from cell respiration is immediately available as a source of
energy in the cell

Â  Â Â 
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a high energy molecule that functions as
an immediate source of power for cell processes

-   One molecule of ATP contains three covalently linked phosphate
    groups â€“ which store potential energy in their bonds
-   When ATP is hydrolysed (to form ADP + Pi) the energy stored in the
    phophate bond is released to be used by the cell
-   Cell respiration uses energy stored in organic molecules to
    regenerate ATP from ADP + Pi (via oxidation)Â 

Relationship between ATP and ADP

[ATP-ADP]
Energy Sources

Cell respiration is typically explained according to the oxidation of a
carbohydrate (glucose), however lipids and proteins can also be used as
energy sources
Carbohydrates are preferable as a ready-made energy source because:Â 

-   They are easier to transport and digest (unlike lipids)Â 
-   They donâ€™t produce nitrogenous wastes (unlike proteins)

Destination

-   Carbohydrates can be broken down into monosaccharides (e.g.
    glucose), which are able to be used in glycolysis
-   Lipids (i.e. triglycerides) can be broken down into glycerol and
    fatty acids, which are able to be used in aerobic respiration
-   Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which are also capable
    of being used in aerobic respiration

Energy Content

-   Lipids produce roughly twice as much energy (~4000 kJ per 100 g) as
    proteins and carbohydrates
-   Both proteins (~1,720 kJ per 100 g)Â and carbohydrates (~1,760 kJ
    per 100 g)Â produce similar levels of energyÂ

A respirometer is a device that determines an organismâ€™sÂ respiration
rate by measuring the rate of exchange of O₂ and CO₂

-   The living specimen (e.g. germinating seeds or invertebrate

-   Carbon dioxide production can be measured with a data logger or by
    pH changes if the specimen is immersed in water

    -   The pressure change can be detected with a data logger or via
        use of a U-tube manometer

Factors which may affect respiration rates include temperature,
hydration, light (plants), age and activity levels

-   An increase in carbon dioxide levels will indicate an increase in
    respiration (CO₂ is a product of aerobic respiration)
-   A decrease in oxygen levels will indicate an increase in respiration
    (O₂ is a requirement for aerobic respiration)

Accessory Pigments

Photosynthetic organisms do not rely on a single pigment to absorb
light, but instead benefit from the combined action of many

-   These photosynthetic pigments are grouped into photosystems that
    absorb and funnel light energy
-   By grouping pigments that have individualised absorption spectra
    together, the cell maximises its light absorption

When a pigment is energised by light, it releases high energy electrons
(ionisation)

-   Antenna pigments transfer their energised electrons to a central
    reaction centre
-   From the reaction centre, electrons are passed on to an acceptor
    molecule in an electron transport chain to synthesise ATP

The presence of accessory pigments explains why not all leaves are green

-   While chlorophyll possesses a green colouration, other pigments
    (e.g.Â anthocyanins) may produce different colours
-   Deciduous trees change colour when leaves stop producing chlorophyll
    in winter when levels of available light are low

Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in photosynthetic organisms that is
responsible for light absorption

-   When chlorophyll absorbs light, it releases electrons which are used
    to synthesise ATP (chemical energy)

There are a number of different chlorophyll molecules, each with their
own absorption spectra, however collectively:

-   Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the
    visible spectrum, followed by the red portion
-   Chlorophyll reflects light most strongly in the green portion of the

-   These pigments include chlorophylls,Â xanthophyll and carotenes

Chromatography is an experimental technique by which mixtures can be
separated

-   A mixture is dissolved in a fluid (called the mobile phase) and
    passed through a static material (called the stationary phase)
-   The different components of the mixture travel at different speeds,
    causing them to separate
-   A retardation factor can then be calculated (Rf value = distance
    component travels Ã· distance solvent travels)

Two of the most common techniques for separating photosynthetic pigments
are:

-   Paper chromatography â€“ uses paper (cellulose) as the stationary
    bed
-   Thin layer chromatography â€“ uses a thin layer ofÂ adsorbent (e.g.

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Temperature, light intensity and CO₂ concentration are possible
limiting factors on the rate ofÂ photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 

[limiting factor]

The law of limiting factors states that when a chemical process depends
on more than one essential condition being favourable, the rate of
reaction will be limited by the factor that is nearest its minimum value

Photosynthesis is dependent on a number of favourable conditions,
including:

-   Temperature
-   Light intensity
-   Carbon dioxide concentration

Temperature

-   Photosynthesis is controlled by enzymes, which are sensitive to
    temperature fluctuations
-   As temperature increases reaction rate will increase, as reactants
    have greater kinetic energy and more collisions result
-   Above a certain temperature the rate of photosynthesis will decrease
    as essential enzymes begin to denature

The Effect of Temperature on Photosynthetic Rate

[temperature photosynthesis]

Light Intensity

-   Light is absorbed by chlorophyll, which convert the radiant energy
    into chemical energy (ATP)
-   As light intensity increases reaction rate will increase, as more
    chlorophyll are beingÂ photo-activated
-   At a certain light intensity photosynthetic rate will plateau, as
    all available chlorophyll are saturated with light
-   Different wavelengths of light will have different effects on the
    rate of photosynthesis (e.g. green light is reflected)

The Effect of Light Intensity on Photosynthetic Rate

[light intensity photosynthesis]

Carbon Dioxide Concentration

-   Carbon dioxide is involved in the fixation of carbon atoms to form
    organic molecules
-   As carbon dioxide concentration increases reaction rate will
    increase, as more organic molecules are being produced
-   At a certain concentration of CO₂ photosynthetic rate will plateau,
    as the enzymes responsible for carbon fixation are saturated

Effect of Carbon Dioxide Concentration on Photosynthetic Rate

[CO2 concentration photosynthesis]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Design of experiments to investigate the effects of limiting
factors on photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthesis can be measured directly via the uptake of CO₂ or
production of O₂, or indirectly via a change in biomass

-   It is important to recognise that these levels may be influenced by
    the relative amount of cell respiration occurring in the tissue

Measuring CO₂ Uptake

-   Carbon dioxide uptake can be measured by placing leaf tissue in an
    enclosed space with water
-   Water free of dissolved carbon dioxide can initially be produced by
    boiling and cooling water
-   Carbon dioxide interacts with the water molecules, producing
    bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, which changes the pH (â†‘ acidity)
-   Increased uptake of CO₂ by the plant will lower the concentration in
    solution and increase the alkalinity (measure with probe)
-   Alternatively, carbon dioxide levels may be monitored via a data
    logger

Measuring O₂ Production

-   Oxygen production can be measured by submerging a plant in an
    enclosed water-filled space attached to a sealed gas syringe
-   Any oxygen gas produced will bubble out of solution and can be
    measured by a change in meniscus level on the syringe
-   Alternatively, oxygen production could be measured by the time taken
    for submerged leaf discs to surface
-   Oxygen levels can also be measured with a data logger if the
    appropriate probe is available

Measuring Biomass (Indirect)

-   Glucose production can be indirectly measured by a change in the
    plantâ€™s biomass (weight)
-   This requires the plant tissue to be completely dehydrated prior to
    weighing to ensure the change in biomass represents organic matter
    and not water content
-   An alternative method for measuring glucose production is to
    determine the change in starch levels (glucose is stored as starch)
-   Starch can be identified via iodine staining (turns starch solution
    purple) and quantitated using a colorimeterÂ

Application:

â€¢ Â Changes to the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, oceans and rock deposition
due to photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 
Only one significant source of oxygen gas exists in the known universe
â€“ biological photosynthesis

-   Before the evolution of photosynthetic organisms, any free oxygen
    produced was chemically captured and stored

Approximately 2.3 billion years ago, photosynthetic organisms began to
saturate the environment with oxygen

-   This led to changes in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, oceans, rock
    deposition and biological life

Oceans

-   Earthâ€™s oceans initially had high levels of dissolved iron
    (released from the crust by underwater volcanic vents)
-   When iron reacts with oxygen gas it undergoes a chemical reaction to
    form an insoluble precipitate (iron oxide)
-   When the iron in the ocean was completely consumed, oxygen gas
    started accumulating in the atmosphere

Atmosphere

-   For the first 2 billion years after the Earth was formed, its
    atmosphere was anoxic (oxygen-free)
-   The current concentration of oxygen gas within the atmosphere is
    approximately 20%

Rock Deposition

-   The reaction between dissolved iron and oxygen gas created oceanic
    deposits called banded iron formations (BIFs)
-   These deposits are not commonly found in oceanic sedimentary rock
    younger than 1.8 billion years old
    -   This likely reflects the time when oxygen levels caused the near
        complete consumption of dissolved iron levels
-   As BIF deposition slowed in oceans, iron rich layers started to form
    on land due to the rise in atmospheric O₂ levels

Biological Life

    levels may have wiped out many of these species

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Photosynthesis is the production of carbon compounds in cells
using light energy

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthesis is the process by which cells synthesise organic
compounds (e.g. glucose) from inorganic molecules (CO₂ and H₂O) in the
presence of sunlight

This process requires a photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll) and can
only occur in certain organisms (plants, certain bacteria)

Photosynthesis Equation

[photosynthesis equation]

Photosynthetic organisms use the light energy from the sun to create
chemical energy (ATP)

-   This chemical energy can either be used directly by the organism or
    used to synthesise organic compounds (e.g. glucose)

Animals then consume these organic compounds as food and release the
stored energy via cell respiration

-   Photosynthesis (anabolic synthesis of organic compounds) is
    essentially the reverse of cell respiration (catabolic breakdown)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Oxygen is produced in photosynthesis from the photolysis of water

â€¢ Â Energy is needed to produce carbohydrates and other carbon
compounds from carbon dioxide

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthesis is a two step process:

-   The light dependent reactions convert light energy from the Sun into
    chemical energy (ATP)
-   The light independent reactions use the chemical energy to
    synthesise organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates)

Step 1: Â Light Dependent Reactions

-   Light is absorbed by chlorophyll, which results in the production of
    ATP (chemical energy)
-   Light is also absorbed by water, which is split (photolysis) to
    produce oxygen and hydrogen
-   The hydrogen and ATP are used in the light independent reactions,
    the oxygen is released from stomata as a waste product

Step 2: Â Light Independent Reactions

-   ATP and hydrogen (carried by NADPH) are transferred to the site of
    the light independent reactions
-   The hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide to form complex organic
    compounds (e.g. carbohydrates, amino acids, etc.)
-   The ATP provides the required energy to power these anabolic
    reactions and fix the carbon molecules together

â€¢ Â Alleles differ from each other by one or only a few bases

Â  Â Â 
Alleles are alternative forms of a gene that code for the different
variations of a specific trait

-   For example, the gene for eye colour has alleles that encode
    different shades / pigments

As alleles are alternative forms of the one gene, they possess very
similar gene sequences

â€¢ Â Comparison of the number of genes in humans with other species

Â  Â Â 
The number of genes present in an organism will differ between species
and is not a valid indicator of biological complexity
The number of genes in a genome is usually predicted by identifying
sequences common to genes

-   These identifying regions may include expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
    or sequences that areÂ homologousÂ to known genes
-   The presence of pseudogenes and transposons make accurate counts of
    unique gene numbers very difficult

As scientists may use different approaches to predicting gene numbers,
final estimations can vary significantlyÂ 

-   For instance, the number of genes in rice (Oryza sativa) is
    estimated as being between 32,000 â€“ 50,000
-   The number of genes in humans is estimated as being between 19,000
    â€“ 25,000

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of a database to determine differences in the base sequence of
a gene in two species

Â  Â Â 
Gene sequences from different species can be identified and then
compared using two online resources:

-   GenBank â€“ a genetic database that serves as an annotated
    collection of DNA sequences
-   Clustal Omega â€“ an alignment program that compares multiple
    sequences of DNA

[]

[]

Identifying Gene Sequences

GenBank can be used to identify the DNA sequence for a gene in a number
of different species

To identify a specific gene sequence:

-   Change the search parameter from nucleotide to gene and type in the
    name of the gene of interest
-   Choose the species of interest and click on the link (underÂ â€˜Name
    / Gene IDâ€™)
-   Scroll to theÂ â€˜Genomic regions, transcripts and
    productsâ€™Â section and click on theÂ â€˜FASTAâ€™Â link

Below are examples of different genes that may be searched for:

-   HBB Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin beta gene
-   COX1 Â â€“ Â Cytochrome oxidase 1 gene
-   F8 Â â€“ Â Coagulation factor VIII gene
-   IGF1R Â â€“ Â Insulin growth factor 1 receptor gene

Comparing Gene Sequences

Clustal Omega aligns multiple gene sequences to allow for the
determination of differences in the base sequence

To construct a multiple alignment:

-   Change the input sequence type to DNA and paste the relevant FASTA
    sequences into the provided space
-   Before each sequence designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)
-   Alternatively, sequences can be saved as a document in plain text
    format (.txt) and then uploaded
-   When all sequences have been included, clickÂ â€˜Submitâ€™Â (under
    step 3)

Clustal Omega possesses several useful features that are absent in
alternative tools like BLASTN:

-   Multiple (more than two) sequences can be compared at once
-   Sequence consensus is colour coded in a Jalview applet found
    underÂ â€˜Result Summaryâ€™Â (requires Java)
-   Branched phylograms can be generated to show evolutionary
    relationships (underÂ â€˜Phylogenetic Treeâ€™)

The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 lead to many
outcomes:

-   Mapping â€“ The number, location, size and sequence of human genes
    is now established

Genome Structure

The human genome comprises of roughly 3.2 billion base pairs across 46
chromosomes

-   However, only a small fraction of this sequence codes for functional
    genes (roughly 1.5% of theÂ genome)

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â New alleles are formed by mutation

Â  Â Â 
A gene mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a section of
DNA coding for a specific trait

-   New alleles are formed by mutation

Gene mutations can be beneficial, detrimental or neutral

-   Beneficial mutations change the gene sequence (missense mutations)
    to create new variations of a trait
-   Detrimental mutations truncate the gene sequence (nonsense
    mutations) to abrogate the normal function of a trait
-   Neutral mutations have no effect on the functioning of the specific
    feature (silent mutations)

Types of Gene Mutations

[mutations]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â The cause of sickle cell anaemia, including a base substitution
mutation, a change to the base sequence of

Â  Â  mRNA transcribed from it and a change to the sequence of a
polypeptide in haemoglobin

Â  Â Â 
Sickle cell anaemia is an example of a disorder caused by a gene
mutation

-   The disease allele arose from a base substitution mutation â€“ where
    a single base was changed in the gene sequence

Cause of Sickle Cell Anaemia

Sickle cell anaemia results from a change to the 6th codon for the beta
chain of haemoglobin

-   DNA: Â The DNA sequence changes from GAG to GTG on the
    non-transcribed strand (CTC to CAC on the template strand)
-   mRNA: Â The mRNA sequence changes from GAG to GUG at the 6th codon
    position
-   Polypeptide: Â The sixth amino acid for the beta chain of
    haemoglobin is changed from glutamic acid to valine (Glu to Val)

[sickle cell cause]

Consequence of Sickle Cell Anaemia

The amino acid change (GluÂ â†’Â Val) alters the structure of
haemoglobin, causing it to form insoluble fibrous strands

-   The insoluble haemoglobin cannot carry oxygen as effectively,
    causing the individual to feel constantly tired

The formation of fibrous haemoglobin strands changes the shape of the
red blood cell to a sickle shape

-   The sickle cells may form clots within the capillaries, blocking
    blood supply to vital organs and causing myriad health issues
-   The sickle cells are also destroyed more rapidly than normal cells,
    leading to a low red blood cell count (anaemia)

[sickle cell consequence]
Pseudogenes

A transposon is a segment of DNA that inserts itself into another
section within the genome (i.e.Â â€˜jumping' genes)

-   Transposition often results in the duplication of the transposable
    element
-   If the duplicated sequence then undergoes random mutation, a
    pseudogene will result

A pseudogene is a non-functional sequence of DNA that is homologous to
an active gene

-   Pseudogenes may beÂ processed (retrotransposed) or non-processed
    (duplicated)

Processed pseudogenes

-   Arise when a portion of an mRNA transcript is reverse transcribed
    back into DNA and inserted into the chromosomal DNA
-   Processed pseudogenes consequently lack introns and promoter
    sequences, but may include a poly-A tract
-   These pseudogenes may be randomly integrated anywhere in the genome

Non-processed pseudogenes

-   Arise as a result of gene duplication and subsequent inactivation by
    mutation
-   Non-processed pseudogenes will often be flanked by transcriptional
    regulatory elements (e.g. promoters, etc.)
-   These pseudogenes are usually located adjacent to the original gene

Pseudogene Formation

[pseudogene]
Sickle Cell versus Malaria

Sickle cell anaemia is controlled by a single gene mutation (via a base
substitution to the haemoglobin beta chain gene)

-   The sixth codon is mutated (GAGÂ â†’Â GUG) which changes the amino
    acid sequence (GluÂ â†’Â Val)

Individuals who only possess the sickle cell allele will have abnormally
shaped red blood cells that are destroyed by the spleen

-   This leads to a reduction in red blood cells and a variety of health
    complications associated with reduced blood cell circulation

Those who only possess the normal blood cell allele do not suffer from
sickle cell anaemia but are more susceptible to malaria

-   Malaria is caused by an endoparasite (Plasmodium falciparum) which
    reproduces inside red blood cells (but not sickle cells)

Incidence of Malaria

In areas where malaria is common, there is a higher incidence of people
who carry both alleles (i.e. are heterozygous)
These individuals produce enough normal blood cells to avoid the more
severe effects associated with sickle cell anaemia, but also produce
enough sickle cells to confer an increased resistance to the malarial
parasite

-   This condition whereby the presence of both alleles is beneficial is
    known as heterozygous advantage

Correlation between Prevalence of Sickle Cell Allele and Malaria

[sickle cell vs malaria]
Types of Mutations

Point mutations are changes to one base in the DNA code and may involve
either:

-   TheÂ substitutionÂ of a base (e.g. ATG becomes ACG)
-   TheÂ insertionÂ of a base (e.g. ATG becomes ATCG)
-   TheÂ deletionÂ of a base (e.g. ATG becomes AG)
-   TheÂ inversionÂ of bases (e.g. ATGÂ becomes AGT)

Base substitutions may create either silent, missense or nonsense
mutations, while insertions and deletions cause frameshift mutations

Effects of Point Mutations

Silent mutationsÂ occur when the DNA change does not alter the amino
acid sequence of the polypeptide

-   This is possible because the genetic code is degenerate and certain
    codons may code for the same amino acid

Missense mutationsÂ occur when the DNA change alters a single amino acid
in the polypeptide chain

-   Sickle cell anaemia is an example of a disease caused by a single
    base substitution mutation (GAGÂ â†’ GTG ; GluÂ â†’ Val)

Nonsense mutationsÂ occur when the DNA change creates a premature STOP
codon which truncates the polypeptide

-   Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease which can result from a
    nonsense mutation (this may not be the only cause though)

Frameshift mutationsÂ occur when the addition or removal of a base
alters the reading frame of the gene

-   This change will affect every codon beyond the point of mutation and
    thus may dramatically change amino acid sequence

Autosome versus Heterosome

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Sex is determined by sex chromosomes and autosomes are chromosomes
that do not determine sex

Â  Â Â 
In humans, sex is determined by a pair of chromosomes called the sex
chromosomes (or heterosomes)

-   Females possess two copies of a large X chromosome (XX)
-   Males possess one copy of an X chromosome and one copy of a much
    shorter Y chromosome (XY)

The Y chromosome contains the genes for developing male sex
characteristics (specifically the SRY gene)

-   In its absence of a Y chromosome, female sex organs will develop
-   The sex chromosomes are homologous in females (XX) but are not
    homologous in males (XY)

Hence the father is always responsible for determining the sex of
offspring:

-   If the male sperm contains an X chromosome, the growing embryo will
    develop into a girl
-   If the male sperm contains a Y chromosome, the growing embryo will
    develop into a boy
-   In all cases the female egg will contain an X chromosome (as the
    mother is XX)Â 

The remaining chromosomes in the organism are called autosomes (they do
not determine sex)

Sex Determination in Humans (the XY System)

[XY Sex Determination]
Block Mutations

Block mutations are changes to segments of a chromosome, leading to
large scale changes to the DNA of an organism

-   Block mutations are commonly caused by transposons, which, by
    changing positions within the genome, alter gene sequence

Several types of block mutations exist, including:Â 

-   Duplications â€“ part of chromosome is copied, resulting in
    duplicate sections (potentially increases gene expression)
-   Deletions â€“ a portion of the chromosome is removed (along with any
    genes contained within this segment)
-   Inversions â€“ a segment of a chromosome is removed and then
    replaced within the chromosome in reverse order
-   Translocations â€“ segments of two chromosomes are exchanged (may
    interrupt gene sequences)

-   Organisms with different diploid numbers are unlikely to be able to
    interbreed (cannot formÂ homologous pairs in zygotes)
-   In cases where different species do interbreed, offspring are
    usually infertile (cannot form functional gametes)
    -   For instance, a horse (diploid = 64) and a donkey (diploid = 62)
        may produce an infertile mule (non-diploid = 63)

Autoradiography

-   Cells are grown in a solution containing radioactive thymidine
    (tritiated thymidine â€“ ³H-T)
-   The tritiated thymidine is incorporated into the chromosomal DNA of
    the cell (³H-T is used as thymidine is not present in RNA)
-   The chromosomes are isolated by gently lysing the cells and fixing
    the chromosomes to a photographic surface
-   The surface is then immersed in a radioactively-sensitive emulsion
    containing silver bromide (AgBr)
-   The radiation released from the tritiated thymidine converts the Ag⁺
    ions in silver bromide into insoluble metal grains
-   Following a period of exposure, excess silver bromide is washed
    away, leaving the silver grains to appear as small black dots
-   When the photographic film is developed, the chromosomal DNA can be
    visualised with an electron microscope

Chromosome Length

-   John Cairns pioneered a technique for measuring the length of DNA
    molecules by autoradiography
-   Previously, chromosome length could only be measured while condensed
    during mitosis (very inaccurate due to supercoiling)
-   Cairns used autoradiography to visualise the chromosomes whilst
    uncoiled, allowing for more accurate indications of length
-   By using tritiated uracil (³H-U), regions of active transcription
    can be identified within the uncoiled chromosome

Chromosome Types

Chromosomes are divided into two parts (p and q arms) with a
constriction point called a centromere in the middle

The centromere can be located in different positions and this forms the
basis for the four different classes of chromosome:

-   Metacentric â€“ centromere is in middle, meaning p and q arms are of
    comparable length (e.g. chromosomes 1, 3, 16, 19, 20)
-   Submetacentric â€“ centromere off-centre, leading to shorter p arm
    relative to q arm (e.g. chromosomes 2, 4 - 12, 17, 18, X)
-   Acrocentric â€“ centromere severely off-set from centre, leading to
    much shorter p arm (e.g. chromosomes 13 - 15, 21, 22, Y)
-   Telocentric â€“ centromere found at end of chromosome, meaning no p
    arm exists (chromosome not found in humans)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Diploid nuclei have pairs of homologous chromosomes

â€¢ Â Haploid nuclei have one chromosome of each pair

Â  Â Â 
As sexually reproducing organisms receive genetic material from both
parents, they have two sets of chromosomes (diploid)

To reproduce in turn, these organisms must create sex cells (gametes)
with half the number of chromosomes (haploid)

When two haploid gametes fuse, the resulting diploid cell (zygote) can
grow and develop into a new organism

Diploid

Nuclei possessing pairs of homologous chromosomes are diploid
(symbolised by 2n)

-   These nuclei will possess two gene copies (alleles) for each trait
-   All somatic (body) cells in the organism will be diploid, with new
    diploid cells created via mitosis
-   Diploid cells are present in most animals and many plants

Haploid

Nuclei possessing only one set of chromosomes are haploid (symbolised by
n)

-   These nuclei will possess a single gene copy (allele) for each trait
-   All sex cells (gametes) in the organism will be haploid, and are
    derived from diploid cells via meiosis
-   Haploid cells are also present in bacteria (asexual) and fungi
    (except when reproducing)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear DNA molecules associated with
histone proteins

Â  Â Â 
The genetic material of eukaryotic cells consist of multiple linear
molecules of DNA that are associated with histone proteins

-   The packaging of DNA with histone proteins results in a greatly
    compacted structure, allowing for more efficient storage Â 

Organisation of eukaryotic chromosomes can be summarised as follows:

-   DNA is complexed with eight histone proteins (an octamer) to form a
    complex called a nucleosome
-   Nucleosomes are linked by an additional histone protein (H1 histone)
    to form a string of chromatosomes
-   These then coil to form a solenoid structure (~6 chromatosomes per
    turn) which is condensed to form a 30 nm fibre
-   These fibres then form loops, which are compressed and folded around
    a protein scaffold to form chromatin
-   Chromatin will then supercoil during cell division to form
    chromosomes that are visible (when stained) under microscope

    CarsonellaÂ ruddi â€“ 160,000 base pairs

As a general rule:

-   Viruses and bacteria tend to have very small genomes
-   Prokaryotes typically have smaller genomes than eukaryotes
-   Sizes of plant genomes can vary dramatically due to the capacity for
    plant species to self-fertilise and become polyploid

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Homologous chromosomes carry the same sequence of genes but not

Â  Â same alleles of those genes

Â  Â Â 
Sexually reproducing organisms inherit their genetic sequences from both
parentsÂ 

-   This means that these organisms will possess two copies of each
    chromosome (one of maternal origin ; one of paternal origin)
-   These maternal and paternal chromosome pairs are called homologous
    chromosomes

Homologous chromosomes are chromosomes that share:

-   The same structural features (e.g. same size, same banding patterns,
    same centromere positions)
-   The same genes at the same loci positions (while the genes are the
    same, alleles may be different)

Homologous chromosomes must be separated in gametes (via meiosis) prior
to reproduction, in order to prevent chromosome numbers continually
doubling with each generation

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In a eukaryote species there are different chromosomes that carry
different genes

Â  Â Â 
Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear molecules of DNA that are compacted
during cell division (mitosis or meiosis)
Each chromosome has a constriction point called a centromere, which
divides the chromosome into two sections (orÂ â€˜armsâ€™)

-   The shorter section is designated the p arm and the longer section
    is designated the q arm

Eukaryotic species possess multiple chromosomes that may differ in both
their size and the position of their centromere

-   Staining chromosomes with particular dyes (e.g. Giemsa stain) will
    additionally generate unique banding patterns

Each chromosome will carry specific genes and the position of a
particular gene on a chromosome is called the locus
The region in which a locus is positioned can be identified via three
points of reference:

-   The first point of reference is a number (or letter) which denotes
    the chromosome (e.g. 7q31 refers to chromosome 7)Â 
-   The second point of reference is a letter (p or q) to denote which
    arm the locus is positioned on (e.g. 7q31 is on the q arm)
-   The third point of reference is a number corresponding to the G band
    location (e.g. 7q31 is at the longitudinal position 31)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of databases to identify the locus of a human gene and its
polypeptide product

Â  Â Â 
The locus of a human gene and its polypeptide product can both be
identified using a single online resource:

-   GenBankÂ â€“ a genetic database that serves as an annotated
    collection of DNA sequences

[genbank]

Identifying Gene Loci

GenBank can be used to identify the specific location of a gene on any
given chromosome

To identify a specific gene locus:

-   Change the search parameter from nucleotide to gene and type in the
    name of the gene of interest
-   Choose the species of interest (i.e. Homo sapiens) and click on the
    link (underÂ â€˜Name / Gene IDâ€™)
-   Scroll to theÂ â€˜Genomic contextâ€™Â section to determine the
    specific position of the gene locus
-   A visual profile can be generated by clicking onÂ â€˜Map
    Viewerâ€™Â link and looking at the Ideogram on the left side

Identifying Polypeptide Products:

GenBank can also be used to identify the polypeptide product of any
given gene

To identify the polypeptide product of a gene:

-   Change the search parameter from nucleotide to gene and type in the
    name of the gene of interest
-   Choose the species of interest (i.e.Â Homo sapiens) and click on the
    link (underÂ â€˜Name / Gene IDâ€™)
-   The polypeptide product should be identified within
    theÂ â€˜Summaryâ€™Â section

Below are examples of different genes that may be searched for:

-   HBBÂ Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin beta gene
-   DRD4Â Â â€“ Â Dopamine receptor D4 gene
-   F8Â Â â€“ Â Coagulation factor VIII gene
-   IGF1RÂ Â â€“ Â Insulin growth factor 1 receptor gene

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A karyogram shows the chromosomes of an organism in homologous
pairs of decreasing length

Â  Â Â 
Karyotypes are the number and types of chromosomes in a eukaryotic cell
â€“ they are determined via a process that involves:

-   Harvesting cells (usually from a foetus or white blood cells of
    adults)
-   Chemically inducing cell division, then arresting mitosis while the
    chromosomes are condensed
-   The stage during which mitosis is halted will determine whether
    chromosomes appear with sister chromatids or not

The chromosomes are stained and photographed to generate a visual
profile that is known as a karyogram

-   The chromosomes of an organism are arranged into homologous pairs
    according to size (with sex chromosomes shown last)

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of karyograms to deduce sex and diagnose Down syndrome in
humans

Â  Â Â 
Karyotyping will typically occur prenatally and is used to:

-   Determine the gender of the unborn child (via identification of the
    sex chromosomes)
-   Test for chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. aneuploidies or
    translocations)

Down syndrome is a condition whereby the individual has three copies of
chromosome 21 (i.e. trisomy 21)

-   It is caused by a non-disjunction event in one of the parental
    gametes
-   The extra genetic material causes mental and physical delays in the
    way the child develops

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Prokaryotes have one chromosome consisting of a circular DNA
molecule

Â  Â Â 
Prokaryotes do not possess a nucleus â€“ instead genetic material is
found free in the cytoplasm in a region called the nucleoid

The genetic material of a prokaryote consists of a single chromosome
consisting of a circular DNA molecule (genophore)

-   The DNA of prokaryotic cells is naked â€“ meaning it is not
    associated with proteins for additional packaging

In addition to the genophore, prokaryotic cells may possess additional
circular DNA molecules called plasmids

Genetic Material in a Prokaryotic Cell

[prokaryote genetics]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some prokaryotes also have plasmids but eukaryotes do not

Â  Â Â 
Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that contain only a few genes
and are capable of self-replication

-   Plasmids are present in some prokaryotic cells, but are not
    naturally present in eukaryotic cells

Bacterial cells may exchange plasmids via their sex pili, in a process
known as bacterial conjugation

-   This exchange of genetic material allows bacteria to evolve new
    features within a generation (horizontal gene transfer)

As plasmids can self-replicate and autonomously synthesise proteins,
they are ideal vectors for gene manipulation in labs

Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic DNA

Prokaryotic DNA:

-   Is found freely in the cytoplasm (within a region called the
    nucleoid)
-   Is naked (i.e. not bound with proteins and therefore doesnâ€™t form
    chromatin)
-   Genomes are compact (contain little repetitive DNA and no introns)
-   Contains extra-chromosomal plasmids
-   Is circular in shape

Eukaryotic DNA:

-   Is contained within a nucleus
-   Is bound to histone proteins
-   Genomes contain large amounts of non-coding and repetitive DNA
    (including introns)
-   Do not contain plasmids (but organelles such as the mitochondria may
    contain their own chromosomes)
-   Are linear in shape

Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic DNA

[pro vs eu DNA]
Sex Determination

Human sex determination occurs according to the X - Y system

-   Females have two copies of the larger X chromosome
-   Males have one X and one Y chromosome (and hence determine gender in
    offspring)

Other Systems

X - 0 System

-   Common in certain insects, including grasshoppers and crickets
-   Females have two copies of the X chromosome (XX), whereas males only
    have one chromosome (X0)
-   Generally, in this method, sex is determined by the overall level of
    gene expression by the X chromosome (less in males)

Z - W System

-   Common in birds, some reptiles and certain insects
-   Males have two copies of the Z chromosome (ZZ), whereas females have
    one Z and one W chromosome (ZW)
-   Certain essential female genes appear to reside on the W chromosome
    (similar to the Y chromosome in human males)

Haplo-diploid System

-   Common in certain insect species, such as ants and bees
-   Unfertilised eggs develop into haploid individuals, which are males
-   Fertilised eggs develop into diploid individuals, which are
    generally female (all bar the reproductive queen are sterile)

Crossing Over

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The early stages of meiosis involve pairing of homologous
chromosomes and crossing overÂ 

Â  Â  followed byÂ condensation

Â  Â Â 
In prophase I, homologous chromosomes undergo a process called synapsis,
whereby they pair up to form a bivalent (or tetrad)

-   The homologous chromosomes are held together at points called
    chiasmata (singular: chiasma)

Crossing over of genetic material between non-sister chromatids can
occur at these chiasmata

-   As a result of this exchange of genetic material, new gene
    combinations are formed on chromatids (recombination)

Once chiasmata are formed, the homologous chromosomes condense as
bivalents and then are separated in meiosis

-   If crossing over occurs then all four haploid daughter cells will be
    geneticallyÂ distinct (sister chromatids are no longer identical)

Crossing Over

[Crossing over]
Drawing Meiosis

Meiosis consists of two divisions and results in the formation of four
daughter cells

-   Interphase replicates DNA in the S phase, so chromosomes should
    initially possess sister chromatidsÂ (Â |Â â†’Â XÂ )
-   The first division separates the homologous pairs ( X XÂ â†’Â X ,
    XÂ ) and hence halves the chromosome number
-   The second division separates the sister
    chromatidsÂ (Â XÂ â†’Â |Â ,Â |Â )Â leading to the formation of
    single chromatid chromosomes
-   By the end of the process, the cells should be haploid (have half
    the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell)

Genetic Variation

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understandings:

â€¢ Â Crossing over and random orientation promotes genetic variation

â€¢ Â Fusion of gametes from different parents promotes genetic
variation

Â  Â Â 
The advantage of meiotic division and sexual reproduction is that it
promotes genetic variation in offspring

The three main sources of genetic variation arising from sexual
reproduction are:

-   Crossing over (in prophase I)
-   Random assortment of chromosomes (in metaphase I)
-   Random fusion of gametes from different parentsÂ 

Crossing Over

Crossing over involves the exchange of segments of DNA between
homologous chromosomes during prophase I

-   The exchange of genetic material occurs between non-sister
    chromatids at points called chiasmata

As a consequence of this recombination, all four chromatids that
comprise the bivalent will be genetically different

-   Chromatids that consist of a combination of DNA derived from both
    homologous chromosomes are called recombinants
-   Offspring with recombinant chromosomes will have unique gene
    combinations that are not present in either parentÂ 

[crossover]

Random Orientation

When homologous chromosomes line up in metaphase I, their orientation
towards the opposing poles is random

The orientation of each bivalent occurs independently, meaning different
combinations of maternal / paternal chromosomes can be inherited when
bivalents separate in anaphase I

-   The total number of combinations that can occur in gametes is 2^(n)
    â€“ where n = haploid number of chromosomes
-   Humans have 46 chromosomes (n = 23) and thus can produce 8,388,608
    different gametes (2²³) by random orientationÂ 
-   If crossing over also occurs, the number of different gamete
    combinations becomesÂ immeasurable

[assortment and variation]

Random Fertilisation

The fusion of two haploid gametes results in the formation of a diploid
zygote

-   This zygote can then divide by mitosis and differentiate to form a
    developing embryo

As meiosis results in genetically distinct gametes, random fertilisation
by egg and sperm will always generate different zygotes

-   Identical twins are formed after fertilisation, by the complete
    fission of the zygote into two separate cell masses

[random fertilisation]
3.3 Â Meiosis

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Alleles segregate during meiosis allowing new
combinations to be formed by the fusion of gametes

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   One diploid nucleus divides by meiosis to produce four haploid
    nuclei
-   Separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes in the firstÂ division
    of meiosis halves the chromosome number
-   DNA is replicated before meiosis so that all chromosomes consist of
    two sister chromatids
-   The early stages of meiosis involve pairing of homologous
    chromosomes and crossing over followed by condensation
-   Orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes prior to separation
    is random
-   The halving of the chromosome number allows a sexual life cycle with
    fusion of gametes
-   Crossing over and random orientation promotes genetic variation
-   Fusion of gametes from different parents promotes genetic variation

â€“ e.g. chorionic villi samplingÂ 

Â  Â and amniocentesis and the associated risks

Â  Â Â 
Karyotyping is the process by which chromosomes are organised and
visualised for inspection

-   Karyotyping is typically used to determine the gender of an unborn
    child and test for chromosomal abnormalities

Cells are harvested from the foetus before being chemically induced to
undertake cell division (so chromosomes are visible)

-   The stage during which mitosis is arrested will determine whether
    chromosomes appear with sister chromatids

Finally, chromosomes are stained and photographed, before being
organised according to structure

-   The visual profile generated is called a karyogram

Chorionic Villi Sampling

Chorionic villi sampling involves removing a sample of the chorionic
villus (placental tissue) via a tube inserted through the cervix

-   It can be done at ~11 weeks of pregnancy with a slight risk of
    inducing miscarriage (~1%)

Amniocentesis

Amniocentesis involves the extraction of a small amount of amniotic
fluid (contains fetal cells) with a needle

-   It is usually conducted later than CVS (~16 weeks of pregnancy) with
    a slightly lower risk of miscarriage (~0.5%)

[ninja icon]

Understandings:

â€¢ Â One diploid nucleus divides by meiosis to produce four haploid
nuclei

â€¢ Â Separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic
division halve the chromosome number

Â  Â Â 
Meiosis is the process by which sex cells (gametes) are made in the
reproductive organs

-   It involves the reduction division of a diploidÂ germline cell into
    four genetically distinct haploid nuclei

The process of meiosis consists of two cellular divisions:

-   The first meiotic division separates pairs of homologous chromosomes
    to halve the chromosome number (diploidÂ â†’Â haploid)
-   The second meiotic division separates sister chromatids (created by
    the replication of DNA during interphase)

Summary of Meiosis

[meiotic division summary]
Mitosis versus Meiosis

Mitosis and meiosis are two processes by which eukaryotic cells may
divide and share several similarities:

-   They are both preceded by interphase (which includes DNA
    replication)
-   They both divide according to a common pathway
    (prophaseÂ â†’Â metaphaseÂ â†’Â anaphaseÂ â†’Â telophase)
-   They both split their cells via cytokinesis

However there are certain key differences which distinguish the two
processes:

-   Division â€“ Mitosis involves only one cell division, but meiosis
    requires two cell divisions
-   Independent assortment â€“ Homologous pairs are randomly separated
    into separate cells in meiosis, but not mitosis
-   Synapsis â€“ Homologous pairs form bivalents in meiosis, but not
    mitosis
-   Crossing over â€“ Non-sister chromatids of homologous pairs may
    exchange genetic material in meiosis, but not mitosis
-   Outcome â€“ Mitosis results in the formation of two daughter cells,
    while meiosis produces four daughter cells
-   Ploidy â€“ Daughter cells produced by mitosis are diploid, while
    daughter cells produced by meiosis are haploid
-   Use â€“ Mitosis is used to clone body cells, while meiosis is used
    to generate sex cells (gametes)
-   Genetics â€“ Cells produced by mitosis are genetically identical
    (clones), while cells produced by meiosis are genetically distinct

Non-Disjunction

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Non-disjunction can cause Down syndrome and other chromosomal
abnormalities

Â  Â Â 
Non-disjunction refers to the chromosomes failing to separate correctly,
resulting in gametes with one extra, or one missing, chromosome
(aneuploidy)

The failure of chromosomes to separate may occur via:

-   Failure of homologues to separate in Anaphase I (resulting in four
    affected daughter cells)
-   Failure of sister chromatids to separate in Anaphase II (resulting
    in only two daughter cells being affected)Â 

Non-Disjunction

[nondisjunction]

Chromosomal Abnormalities

If a zygote is formed from a gamete that has experienced a
non-disjunction event, the resulting offspring will have extra or
missing chromosomes in every cell of their bodyÂ 
Conditions that arise from non-disjunction events include:

-   Patauâ€™s Syndrome (trisomy 13)
-   Edwards Syndrome (trisomy 18)
-   Down Syndrome (trisomy 21)
-   Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY)
-   Turnerâ€™s Syndrome (monosomy X)

Down Syndrome

Individuals with Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21
(trisomy 21)

-   One of the parental gametes had two copies of chromosome 21 as a
    result of non-disjunction
-   The other parental gamete was normal and had a single copy of
    chromosome 21
-   When the two gametes fused during fertilisation, the resulting
    zygote had three copies of chromosome 21

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Studies showing age of parents influences chances of
non-disjunction

Â  Â Â 
Studies show that the chances of non-disjunction increase as the age of
the parents increase

-   There is a particularly strong correlation between maternal age and
    the occurrence of non-disjunction events
-   This may be due to developing oocytes being arrested in prophase I
    until ovulation as part of the process of oogenesisÂ 

Other studies also suggest that:

-   The risk of chromosomal abnormalities in offspring increase
    significantly after a maternal age of 30 Â (Table 1 / Figure 1)
-   There is a higher incidence of chromosomal errors in offspring as a
    result of non-disjunction in meiosis I Â (Figure 2)
-   Mean maternal age is increasing, leading to an increase in the
    number of Down syndrome offspring Â (Figure 3)

Studies into the Development of Chromosomal Abnormalities

[Down syndrome statistics]
Polyploidy

Sexual reproduction requires chromosomal content to be halved in the sex
cells to produce haploid gametes

-   The process by which haploid gametes are created is called meiosis
    (meiosis I is the reduction division)
-   Fusion of two haploid gametes creates a diploid zygote that can then
    grow and develop via mitotic division

If meiotic formation of haploid gametes did not precede fertilisation,
chromosomal content would double every generation

-   Polyploidy is a condition whereby an organism has more than two
    complete sets of chromosomes in all cells (i.e. > diploid)
-   Polyploidy is far more common in plant species which lack separate
    sexes and are capable of self-pollination
-   Polyploidy is very rare in animal species due to the consequences of
    having extra allele copies of every gene

Random Assortment

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes prior to separation
is random

Â  Â Â 
During metaphase I, homologous chromosomes line up at the equator as
bivalents in one of two arrangements:

-   Maternal copy left / paternal copy right Â OR Â paternal copy left /
    maternal copy right

This orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes is random, as is the
subsequent assortment of chromosomes into gametes

-   The final gametes will differ depending on whether they got the
    maternal or paternal copy of a chromosome following anaphase I

As this random assortment will occur for each homologous pair, the
number of possible gamete combinations are dependent on the number of
homologous pairs

-   Gamete combinations = 2^(n) (where n represents the haploid number)

Sexual Life Cycle

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The halving of the chromosome number allows a sexual life cycle
with fusion of gametes

Â  Â Â 
Most sexually reproducing organisms are diploid, meaning they have two
copies of every chromosome (maternal / paternal copy)

-   In order to reproduce, these organisms need to make gametes that are
    haploid (one copy of each chromosome)

Fertilisation of two haploid gametes (egg + sperm) will result in the
formation of a diploid zygote that can grow via mitosis

-   If chromosome number was not halved in gametes, total chromosome
    numbers would double each generation (polyploidy)

Sister Chromatids

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA is replicated before meiosis so that all chromosomes consist
of two sister chromatids

Â  Â Â 
Meiosis is preceded by interphase, during which DNA is replicated (in
the S phase) to produce two genetically identical copies

-   The two identical DNA molecules are identified as sister chromatids,
    and are held together by a single centromere
-   The sister chromatids are separated during meiosis II, following the
    separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I

Sister Chromatids

[meiotic sister chromatids]
Somatic vs Germline Mutations

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be classed as either somatic
or germ-line:

-   Somatic mutations â€“ occur in a single body cell and cannot be
    inherited (only tissues derived from mutated cell are affected)
-   Germline mutations â€“ occur in gametes and can be passed onto
    offspring (every cell in the entire organism will be affected)

Stages of Meiosis

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing diagrams to show the stages of meiosis resulting in the
formation of four haploid cells

Â  Â Â 
Meiosis consists of two divisions, both of which follow the same stages
as mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)

-   Meiosis is preceded by interphase, in which DNA is replicated to
    produce chromosomes consisting of two sister chromatids
-   A second growth phase called interkinesis may occur between meiosis
    I and II, however no DNA replication occurs in this stage

Meiosis I

The first meiotic division is a reduction
divisionÂ (diploidÂ â†’Â haploid)Â in which homologous chromosomes are
separatedÂ 

-   P-I: Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, homologous
    chromosomes form bivalents, crossing over occurs
-   M-I: Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes connect to bivalents
    (at centromeres) and align them along the middle of the cell
-   A-I: Spindle fibres contract and split the bivalent, homologous
    chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell
-   T-I: Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membrane may reform, cell
    divides (cytokinesis) to form two haploid daughter cells

Meiosis II

The second division separates sister chromatids (these chromatids may
not be identical due to crossing over in prophase I)Â 

-   P-II: Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, centrosomes
    move to opposite poles (perpendicular to before)
-   M-II: Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes attach to chromosomes
    (at centromere) and align them along the cell equator
-   A-II: Spindle fibres contract and separate the sister chromatids,
    chromatids (now called chromosomes) move to opposite poles
-   T-II: Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membrane reforms, cells divide
    (cytokinesis) to form four haploid daughter cellsÂ 

The final outcome of meiosis is the production of four haploid daughter
cells

-   These cells may all be genetically distinct if crossing over occurs
    in prophase I (causes recombination of sister chromatids)

Epistasis

Epistasis describes a condition whereby one gene controls the expression
of another gene
In mice, the expression of a specific fur colour by one gene is
dependent upon the production of hair pigment by another gene

-   Black fur (B) is dominant to brown fur (b), but in the absence of
    hair pigment (cc) mice will appear albino

In humans, the gene for baldness supersedes genes for hair colour and
hence is epistatic in nature

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Radiation and mutagenic chemicals increase the mutation rate and
can cause genetic diseases and cancer

Â  Â Â 
A gene mutation is a change to the base sequence of a gene that can
affect the structure and function of the protein it encodes

-   Mutations can be spontaneous (caused by copying errors during DNA
    replication) or induced by exposure to external elements

Examples of factors which can induce mutations include:

-   Radiation â€“ e.g. UV radiation from the sun, gamma radiation from
    radioisotopes, X-rays from medical equipment
-   Chemical â€“ e.g. reactive oxygen species (found in pollutants),
    alkylating agents (found in cigarettes)
-   Biological Agents â€“ e.g. bacteria (such as Helicobacter pylori),
    viruses (such as human papilloma virus)

Agents which increase the rate of genetic mutations are called mutagens,
and can lead to the formation of genetic diseases

-   Mutagens which lead to the formation of cancer are more specifically
    referred to as carcinogens

Application:

â€¢ Â Consequences of radiation after nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and
accident at Chernobyl

Â  Â Â 
The nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and accident at Chernobyl are two
examples of a catastrophic release of radioactive material

-   The nuclear bombing of Hiroshima (and Nagasaki) occurred in August
    1945, during the final stages of World War II
-   The Chernobyl accident occurred in April 1986, when an explosion at
    the reactor core caused the release of radioactive material

Of the two incidents, more people died from the nuclear bombing, but the
meltdown released far more radiation (~400Ã—)

-   The Chernobyl meltdown involved far more fissionable material and
    produced different isotopes with much longer half-lives
-   The Hiroshima nuclear bomb was detonated above ground and radiation
    was dispersed, resulting in less irradiation of the soil

Some of the long-term consequences of radiation exposure following these
disasters include:

-   An increased incidence in cancer development (with a strong
    correlation between dose of radiation and frequency of cancer)
-   Reduced T cell counts and altered immune functions, leading to
    higher rates of infection
-   A wide variety of organ-specific health effects (e.g. liver
    cirrhosis, cataract induction, etc.)

Some of the consequences of radiation exposure are specific to the
incident due to the types and amounts of radiation released

-   Thyroid disease was a common consequence of the Chernobyl accident
    due to the release of radioactive iodine
-   There was no significant increase in birth defects following the
    Hiroshima bombing, but an estimated 250% increase in
    congenitalÂ abnormalities following the Chernobyl meltdown

Whereas Hiroshima is still habitable and well populated, certain regions
of Chernobyl remain unsafe for human habitation

-   There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that radiation levels around
    Chernobyl have caused variation to local flora and fauna
-   The presence of residual radiation in the environment can become
    concentrated in organisms via bioaccumulation

Genetic Diseases

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Many genetic diseases in humans are due to recessive alleles of
autosomal genes, although some geneticÂ 

Â  Â diseases are due to dominant or co-dominant alleles

Â  Â Â 
Genetic diseases are caused when mutations to a gene (or genes) abrogate
normal cellular function, leading to the development of a disease
phenotype

-   Genetic diseases can be caused by recessive, dominant or co-dominant
    alleles

An autosomal recessive genetic disease will only occur if both alleles
are faulty

-   Heterozygous individuals will possess one copy of the faulty allele
    but not develop disease symptoms (they are carriers)
-   An example of an autosomal recessive genetic disease is cystic
    fibrosis

An autosomal dominant genetic disease only requires one copy of a faulty
allele to cause the disorder

-   Homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals will both develop
    the full range of disease symptoms
-   An example of an autosomal dominant genetic disease is
    Huntingtonâ€™s disease

If a genetic disease is caused by co-dominant alleles it will also only
require one copy of the faulty allele to occur

-   However, heterozygous individuals will have milder symptoms due to
    the moderating influence of a normal allele
-   An example of a genetic disease that displays co-dominance is sickle
    cell anaemia

Inheritance Patterns for Dominant and Recessive Genetic Disorders

[inheritance of genetic disease]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Inheritance of cystic fibrosis and Huntingtonâ€™s disease

Â  Â Â 
Cystic Fibrosis

-   Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a
    mutation to the CFTR gene on chromosome 7
-   Individuals with cystic fibrosis produce mucus which is unusually
    thick and sticky
-   This mucus clogs the airways and secretory ducts of the digestive
    system, leading to respiratory failure and pancreatic cysts
-   Heterozygous carriers who possess one normal allele will not develop
    disease symptoms

[cystic fibrosis]

Huntingtonâ€™s Disease

-   Huntingtonâ€™s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a
    mutation to the Huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4
-   The HTT gene possesses a repeating trinucleotide sequence (CAG) that
    is usually present in low amounts (10 â€“ 25 repeats)
-   More than 28 CAG repeats is unstable and causes the sequence to
    amplify (produce even more repeats)
-   When the number of repeats exceeds ~40, the huntingtin protein will
    misfold and cause neurodegeneration
-   This usually occurs in late adulthood and so symptoms usually
    develop noticeably in a personâ€™s middle age (~40 years)Â 
-   Symptoms of Huntingtonâ€™s disease include uncontrollable, spasmodic
    movements (chorea) and dementia

[huntingtons disease]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Many genetic diseases have been identified in humans but most are
very rare

Â  Â Â 
There are over 4,000 identified single gene defects that lead to genetic
disease, but most are very rare

-   Any allele that adversely affects survival and hence the capacity to
    reproduce is unlikely to be passed on to offspring

Recessive conditions tend to be more common, as the faulty allele can be
present in carriers without causing disease

Dominant conditions may often have a late onset, as this does not
prevent reproduction and the transfer of the faulty allele
Haploid Gametes

List

[ninja icon]

Understandings:

â€¢ Â Gametes are haploid so contain only one allele of each gene

â€¢ Â The two alleles of each gene separate into different haploid
nuclei during meiosis

Â  Â Â 
Gametes are haploid sex cells formed by the process of meiosis â€“ males
produce sperm and females produce ova

-   During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated into
    different nuclei prior to cell division
-   As homologous chromosomes carry the same genes, segregation of the
    chromosomes also separates the allele pairs
-   Consequently, as gametes contain only one copy of each chromosome
    they therefore carry only one allele of each geneÂ

3.4 Â Inheritance

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The inheritance of genes follows patterns

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Mendel discovered the principles of inheritance with experiments in
    which large numbers of pea plants were crossed
-   Gametes are haploid so contain only one allele of each gene
-   The two alleles of each gene separate into different haploid
    daughter nuclei during meiosis
-   Fusion of gametes results in diploid zygotes with two alleles of
    each gene that may be the same allele or different alleles
-   Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles but
    co-dominant alleles have joint effects
-   Many genetic diseases in humans are due to recessive alleles of
    autosomal genes, although some genetic diseases are due to dominant
    or co-dominant alleles
-   Some genetic diseases are sex linked
-   The pattern of inheritance is different with sex-linked genes due to
    their location on sex chromosomes
-   Many genetic diseases have been identified in humans but most are
    very rare
-   Radiation and mutagenic chemicals increase the mutation rate and can
    cause genetic diseases and cancer

Applications:

-   Inheritance of ABOÂ blood groups
-   Red-green colour blindness and haemophilia as examples of sex-linked
    inheritance
-   Inheritance of cystic fibrosis and Huntingtonâ€™s disease
-   Consequences of radiation after nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and
    accident at Chernobyl

Skill:

-   Construction of Punnett grids for predicting the outcomes of
    monohybrid genetic crosses
-   Comparison of predicted and actual outcomes of genetic crosses using
    real data
-   Analysis of pedigree charts to deduce the patterns of inheritance of
    genetic diseases
Lethal Alleles

Lethal alleles are alleles that cause an organism to die only when
present in a homozygous condition

-   The gene involved is considered an essential gene and the lethal
    allele may be either dominant or recessive

An example of lethal alleles in humans is achondroplasia, a genetic
condition which causes dwarfism

-   The lethal allele is dominant and hence causes the death of the
    organism when present in the homozygous state (AA)
-   Heterozygotes will possess a significantly shorter stature
    (dwarfism), while homozygous recessive individuals will be normal
    size

By causing the death of one genotypic variant, lethal alleles create
altered genotypic and phenotypic ratios to the norm

-   Normally a cross of two heterozygotes will generate a 3 : 1 ratio
    (dominant : recessive)
-   In achondroplasia, two dwarf heterozygotes are expected to generate
    a 2 : 1 ratio (the homozygous dominant doesnâ€™t survive)

Mendelâ€™s Laws

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mendel discovered the principles of inheritance with experiments
in which a large numberÂ of pea plants

Â  Â were crossed

Â  Â Â 
Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk who developed the principles of
inheritance by performing experiments on pea plants

-   First, he crossed different varieties of purebred pea plants, then
    collected and grew the seeds to determine their characteristics
-   Next, he crossed the offspring with each other (self-fertilization)
    and grew their seeds to similarly determine their characteristics
-   These crosses were performed many times to establish reliable data
    trends (over 5,000 crosses were performed)

As a result of these experiments, Mendel discovered the following
things:

1.  When he crossed two different purebred varieties together the
    results were not a blendÂ â€“ only one feature would be expressed
    -   E.g. When purebred tall and short pea plants were crossed, all
        offspring developed into tall growing plants
2.  When Mendel self-fertilised the offspring, the resulting progeny
    expressed the two different traits in a ratio of ~ 3:1
    -   E.g. When the tall growing progeny were crossed, tall and short
        pea plants were produced in a ratio of ~ 3:1Â 

From these findings, Mendel drew the following conclusions:

-   Organisms have discrete factors that determine its features
    (theseÂ â€˜factorsâ€™Â are now recognised as genes)
-   Furthermore, organisms possess two versions of each factor
    (theseÂ â€˜versionsâ€™Â are now recognised as alleles)
-   Each gamete contains only one version of each factor (sex cells are
    now recognised to be haploid)
-   Parents contribute equally to the inheritance of offspring as a
    result of the fusion between randomly selected egg and sperm
-   For each factor, one version is dominant over another and will be
    completely expressed if present

While there are caveats to Mendelâ€™s conclusions, certain rules can be
established:

1.  Law of Segregation: When gametes form, alleles are separated so that
    each gamete carries only one allele for each gene
2.  Law of Independent Assortment: The segregation of alleles for one
    gene occurs independently to that of any other gene*
3.  Principle of Dominance: Recessive alleles will be masked by dominant
    alleles^(â€ )

* Â The law of independent assortment does not hold true for genes
located on the same chromosome (i.e. linked genes)
^(â€ )Â  Not all genes show a complete dominance hierarchy â€“ some
genes show co-dominance or incomplete dominance

Modes of Inheritance

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles but
co-dominant alleles have joint effects

Â  Â Â 
The gene composition (i.e. allele combination) for a specific trait is
referred to as the genotypeÂ 

-   The genotype of a particular gene will typically be either
    homozygous or heterozygous

The observable characteristics of a specific trait (i.e. the physical
expression) is referred to as the phenotype

-   The phenotype is determined by both the genotype and environmental
    influencesÂ 

Complete Dominance

Most traits follow a classical dominant / recessive pattern of
inheritance, whereby one allele is expressed over the other

-   The dominant allele will mask the recessive allele when in a
    heterozygous state
-   Homozygous dominant and heterozygous forms will be phenotypically
    indistinguishable
-   The recessive allele will only be expressed in the phenotype when in
    a homozygous state

When representing alleles, the convention is to capitalise the dominant
allele and use a lower case letter for the recessive allele

-   An example of this mode of inheritance is mouse coat colour â€“
    black coats (BB or Bb) are dominant to brown coats (bb)

Complete Dominance (Mouse Coat Colour)

[complete dominance]

Co-dominance

Co-dominance occurs when pairs of alleles are both expressed equally in
the phenotype of a heterozygous individual

-   Heterozygotes therefore have an altered phenotype as the alleles are
    having a joint effect

When representing alleles, the convention is to use superscripts for the
different co-dominant alleles (recessive still lower case)

-   An example of co-dominance is feathering in chickens â€“ black
    (C^(B)) and white (C^(W)) feathers create a speckled coat
    (C^(B)C^(W))

Co-dominance (Chicken Feathering)

[codominance]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Inheritance of ABO blood groups

Â  Â Â 
Human red blood cells can be categorised into different blood groups
based on the structure of a surface glycoprotein (antigen)

-   The ABO blood groups are controlled by a single gene with multiple
    alleles (A, B, O)

The A, B and O alleles all produce a basic antigen on the surface of red
blood cells

-   The A and B alleles are co-dominant and each modify the structure of
    the antigen to produce different variants
-   The O allele is recessive and does not modify the basic antigenic
    structure

When representing blood group alleles, the letter I is used to represent
the different antigenic forms (isoantigens)

-   A allele = I^(A) Â ; Â B allele = I^(B) Â ; Â O allele = i
    (recessive)

The genotypes for the different blood groups can be summarised as
follows:

[blood type table]

As humans produce antibodies against foreign antigens, blood
transfusions are not compatible between certain blood groups

-   AB blood groups can receive blood from any other type (as they
    already possess both antigenic variants on their cells)
-   A blood groups cannot receive B blood or AB blood (as the isoantigen
    produced by the B allele is foreign)
-   B blood groups cannot receive A blood or AB blood (as the isoantigen
    produced by the A allele is foreign)
-   O blood groups can only receive transfusions from other O blood
    donor (both antigenic variants are foreign)

The Consequence of an Incompatible Blood Transfusion

[blood transfusion]
Mosaicism

Mosaicism describes the presence of two populations of cells with
distinct genotypes within a single organism

-   It is caused when either mutation or division error creates two
    distinct cell types which divide into separate cell lines

Mosaicism is more pronounced when errors occur in early embryo
development and thus affects a greater proportion of cells

-   X-inactivation in mammals creates a mosaic of genotypes linked to
    the X chromosome only, and hence is not true mosaicism

Mosaicism

Pedigree Charts

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of pedigree charts to deduce the patterns of inheritance
of genetic diseases

Â  Â Â 
A pedigree is a chart of the genetic history of a family over several
generations

-   Males are represented as squares, while females are represented as
    circles
-   Shaded symbols mean an individual is affected by a condition, while
    an unshaded symbol means they are unaffected
-   A horizontal line between man and woman represents mating and
    resulting children are shown as offshoots to this line
-   Generations are labeled with roman numerals and individuals are
    numbered according to age (oldest on the left)

Determining Autosomal Inheritance

Dominant and recessive disease conditions may be identified only if
certain patterns occur (otherwise it cannot be confirmed)

Autosomal Dominant

-   IfÂ both parents are affected and an offspring is unaffected, the
    traitÂ mustÂ be dominant (parents are both heterozygous)
-   All affected individuals must have at least one affected parent
-   If both parents are unaffected, all offspring must be unaffected
    (homozygous recessive)

Autosomal Recessive

-   IfÂ both parents are unaffected and an offspring is affected, the
    traitÂ mustÂ be recessive (parents are heterozygous carriers)
-   If both parents show a trait, all offspring must also exhibit the
    trait (homozygous recessive)

Determining X-Linked Inheritance

It is not possible to confirm sex linkage from pedigree charts, as
autosomal traits could potentially generate the same results

-   However certain trends can be used to confirm that a trait is not
    X-linked dominant or recessive

X-linked Dominant

-   If a male shows a trait, so too must all daughters as well as his
    mother
-   An unaffected mother cannot have affected sons (or an affected
    father)
-   X-linked dominant traits tend to be more common in females (this is
    not sufficient evidence though)

X-linked Recessive

-   If a female shows a trait, so too must all sons as well as her
    father
-   An unaffected mother can have affected sons if she is a carrier
    (heterozygous)
-   X-linked recessive traits tend to be moreÂ common in males (this is
    not sufficient evidence though)

Determining Inheritance from Pedigree Charts

[pedigree charts]
Pleiotropy

Pleiotropy occurs when a single gene affects multiple traits â€“ hence
mutationsÂ will tend to beÂ severe and affect multiple systems

Pleiotropy can be observed in the multiple health issues arising from
sickle cell anaemia (mutation to the beta-globin gene)

-   The rapid breakdown of red blood cells causes anaemia, leading to
    increased lethargy and higher risks of infection
-   The clotting of sickle cells in vessels can cause heart attacks and
    brain damage (strokes and paralysis)
-   The accumulation of blood cells in specific organs can lead to loss
    of function (e.g. liver or splenic failure, kidney damage, etc.)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Construction of Punnett grids for predicting the outcome of
monohybrid genetic crossesÂ 

Â  Â Â 
A monohybrid cross determines the allele combinations for potential
offspring for one gene only

Monohybrid crosses can be calculated according to the following steps:

-   Step 1: Â Designate letters to represent alleles (dominant = capital
    letter ; recessive = lower case ; co-dominant = superscript)
-   Step 2: Â Write down the genotype and phenotype of the prospective
    parents (this is the P generation)
-   Step 3: Â Write down the genotype of the parental gametes (these
    will be haploid and thus consist of a single allele each)
-   Step 4: Â Draw a grid with maternal gametes along the top and
    paternal gametes along the left (this is a Punnett grid)
-   Step 5: Â Complete the Punnett grid to determine potential genotypes
    and phenotypes of offspring (this is the F₁ generation)

Overview of a Monohybrid Cross

[punnett grid]

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Comparison of predicted and actual outcomes of genetic crosses
using real data

Â  Â Â 
The genotypic and phenotypic ratios calculated via Punnett grids are
only probabilities and may not always reflect actual trends

-   E.g. When flipping a coin there is a 50% chance of landing on heads
    â€“ this doesnâ€™t mean you will land on heads 50% of the time

When comparing predicted outcomes to actual data, larger data sets are
more likely to yield positive correlations

-   Gregor Mendel performed over 5,000 crosses as part of his pea plant
    experiment
-   However many statisticians believe Mendelâ€™s results are too close
    to the exact ratios predicted to be genuine

Mendelâ€™s Pea Plant Experimental Data

[Mendel's data]

Mendel crossed different varieties of pea plants and recorded the
characteristics of resultant offspring

-   Initially, he crossed purebred dominant and purebred recessive
    plants in order to produce heterozygotes (F₁ generation)
-   He then self-pollinated the heterozygotes to produce an F₂
    generation and counted the dominant and recessive phenotypes
-   The expected ratio of dominant : recessive phenotypes was 3 : 1 â€“
    this ratio was supported by the experimental data
Role of Environment

The phenotype is the observable characteristics or traits of an organism

-   It is predominantly determined by the organismâ€™s genotype (allele
    combination) for each particular feature

However environmental factors may also influence the expression of
characteristics

-   Hydrangeas change colour depending on the pH of the soil (acidic
    soil = blue flower ; alkaline soil = pink flower)
-   Human skin colour is determined by the expression of melanin
    pigment, but levels can change depending on sun exposureÂ

Sex Linked Genes

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some genetic diseases are sex-linked

Â  Â Â 
Sex linkage refers to when a gene controlling a characteristic is
located on a sex chromosome (X or Y)

-   The Y chromosome is much shorter than the X chromosome and contains
    only a few genes (50 million bp; 78 genes)
-   The X chromosome is longer and contains many genes not present on
    the Y chromosomes (153 million bp ; ~ 2,000 genes)
-   Hence, sex-linked conditions are usually X-linked - as very few
    genes exist on the shorter Y chromosome

X and Y chromosomes

[X and Y comparison]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The pattern of inheritance is different with sex-linked genes due
to their location on sex chromosomes

Â  Â Â 
Sex-linked inheritance patterns differ from autosomal patterns due to
the fact that the chromosomes arenâ€™t paired in males (XY)

-   This leads to the expression of sex-linked traits being
    predominantly associated with a particularly gender

As human females have two X chromosomes (and therefore two alleles),
they can be either homozygous or heterozygous

-   Hence, X-linked dominant traits are more common in females (as
    either allele may be dominant and cause disease)

Human males have only one X chromosome (and therefore only one allele)
and are hemizygous for X-linked traits

-   X-linked recessive traits are more common in males, as the condition
    cannot be masked by a second allele

The following trends always hold true for X-linked conditions:

-   Only females can be carriers (a heterozygote for a recessive disease
    condition), males cannot be heterozygous carriers
-   Males will always inherit an X-linked trait from their mother (they
    inherit a Y chromosome from their father)
-   Females cannot inherit an X-linked recessive condition from an
    unaffected father (must receive his dominant allele)

Inheritance of an X-linked Recessive Disease Condition

[X-linked inheritance]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Red-green colour blindness and haemophilia as examples of
sex-linked inheritance

Â  Â Â 
Red-green colour blindness andÂ haemophilia are both examples of
X-linked recessive conditions

-   Consequently, they are both far more common in males than in females
    (males cannot mask the trait as a carrier)

When assigning alleles for a sex-linked trait, the convention is to
write the allele as a superscript to the sex chromosome (X)

-   Haemophilia:Â  X^(H) = unaffected (normal blood clotting) ; X^(h) =
    affected (haemophilia)
-   Colour blindness: Â X^(A) = unaffected (normal vision) ; X^(a) =
    affected (colour blindness)

Haemophilia

Haemophilia is a genetic disorder whereby the bodyâ€™s ability to
control blood clotting (and hence stop bleeding) is impaired

-   The formation of a blood clot is controlled by a cascade of
    coagulation factors whose genes are located on the X chromosome
-   When one of these factors becomes defective, fibrin formation is
    prevented - meaning bleeding continues for a long time
-   Different forms of haemophilia can occur, based on which specific
    coagulation factor is mutated (e.g. haemophilia A = factor VIII)

Red-Green Colour Blindness

Red-green colour blindness is a genetic disorder whereby an individual
fails to discriminate between red and green hues

-   This condition is caused by a mutation to the red or green retinal
    photoreceptors, which are located on the X chromosome
-   Red-green colour blindness can be diagnosed using the Ishihara
    colour test

Types of Zygosity

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fusion of gametes results in diploid zygotes with two alleles of
each gene that may be the same alleleÂ 

Â  Â or different alleles

Â  Â Â 
Gametes are haploid, meaning they only possess one allele for each gene

When male and female gametes fuse during fertilisation, the resulting
zygote will containÂ two alleles for each gene

-   Exception: Males have only one allele for each gene located on a sex
    chromosome, as these chromosomes arenâ€™t paired (XY)Â 

For any given gene, the combination of alleles can be categorised as
follows:

-   If the maternal and paternal alleles are the same, the offspring is
    said to be homozygous for that gene
-   If the maternal and paternal alleles are different, the offspring is
    said to be heterozygous for that gene
-   Males only have one allele for each gene located on a sex chromosome
    and are said to be hemizygous for that gene

Types of Zygosity

[types of zygosity]
X-Inactivation

X-inactivation is the process by which one of the two X chromosomes
present in females is inactivated

-   This ensures that females do not produce twice as many X-linked gene
    proteins as males (who possess one X chromosome)

The silenced X chromosome is packaged as transcriptionally inactive
heterochromatin, forming a structure called a Barr body

-   Once an X chromosome is inactivated, it will remain permanently
    inactive in the cell (and all cells derived from it)

X-inactivation occurs randomly in mammals, meaning both X chromosomes
may be active in different cells

-   This allows for a heterozygous phenotype to occur in the female as a
    whole

Artificial Cloning

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Animals can be cloned at the embryo stage by breaking up the
embryo into more than one group of cells

Â  Â Â 
At a very early stage, embryonic cells retain pluripotency (meaning they
can divide and become any type of tissue)

-   These cells will differentiate to form all the different tissues
    comprising the organism

If these embryonic cells are separated artificially in the laboratory,
each group of cells will form cloned organisms

-   This separation of embryonic cells can also occur naturally to give
    rise to identical (monozygotic) twins

The separation of embryonic cells has to happen early in the
developmental cycle, ideally around the 8 cell stage (morula)

-   The separated groups of cells are then implanted into the uterus of
    a surrogate to develop into genetically identical clones

This method of cloning is limited by the fact that the embryo used is
still formed randomly via sexual reproduction and so the specific
genetic features of the resulting clones have yet to be determined

Cloning via Embryonic Division

[embryo cloning]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Methods have been developed for cloning adult organisms using
differentiated cells

Â  Â Â 
A second and more reliable method of artificial cloning involves somatic
cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)

-   This involves replacing the haploid nucleus of an unfertilised egg
    with a diploid nucleus from an adult donorÂ 
-   The advantage of this technique is that it is known what traits the
    clones will develop (they are genetically identical to the donor)

This method of using differentiated cells to generate cloned embryos can
be used for two main purposes:

-   Reproductive cloning:Â  If the embryo is implanted into the uterus
    of a surrogate, a new cloned organism will develop
-   Therapeutic cloning:Â  Embryonic cells can be induced to
    differentiate to create specific tissues or organs for
    transplantation

Comparison of Reproductive and Therapeutic Cloning

[artificial cloning]
cDNA and Microarrays

Individuals can be screened for genetic diseases and cancers by using
cDNA and microarrays

-   This technology can also be used to investigate the protein
    expression pathways that lead to these conditions

cDNA

-   Complementary DNA (cDNA) is a molecule synthesised from an mRNA
    template via reverse transcription
-   cDNA molecules represent gene sequences that are actively
    transcribed by a cell (as they were synthesised from mRNA)Â 
-   This makes them a valuable tool for determining expression patterns
    of proteins in normal and diseased states

Microarray

-   A DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA sequences
    (oligos) attached to a solid surface
-   These sequences represent fractions of a large library of genes that
    are present in a cell
-   If a gene is active within a cell, then the cDNA (produced from the
    mRNA transcript) will bind to its complementary oligo
-   If the cDNA has been fluorescently labeled, then the complementary
    oligo can be identifiedÂ (along with the gene it represents)
-   If cDNA from healthy and diseased cells are labeled with different
    fluorophores, comparisons of gene expression can be made
-   Genes that are only active in a diseased or normal state will be of
    particular interest to scientists

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Clones are groups of genetically identical organisms, derived from
a single original parent cell

Â  Â Â 
Clones are groups of genetically identical organisms or a group of cells
derived from a single original parent cell

-   Organisms that reproduce asexually will produce genetically
    identical clones
-   Additionally, mechanisms exist whereby sexually reproducing
    organisms can produce clones (e.g. identical twins)

Cloning multicellular organisms requires the production of stem cells
(differentiated cells cannot form other cell types)

-   Stem cells can be artificially generated from adult tissue using a
    process called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Production of cloned embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear
transfer

Â  Â Â 
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a method by which cloned embryos can be
produced using differentiated adult cells

-   Somatic cells are removed from the adult donor and cultured (these
    cells are diploid and contain the entire genome)
-   An unfertilised egg is removed from a female adult and its haploid
    nucleus is removed to produce an enucleated egg cell
-   The enucleated egg cell is fused with the nucleus from the adult
    donor to make a diploid egg cell (with the donorâ€™s DNA)
-   An electric current is then delivered to stimulate the egg to divide
    and develop into an embryo
-   The embryo is then implanted into the uterus of a surrogate and will
    develop into a genetic clone of the adult donorÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA profiling involves comparison of DNA

Â  Â Â 
DNA profiling is a technique by which individuals can be identified and
compared via their respective DNA profiles

-   Within the non-coding regions of an individualâ€™s genome there
    exists satellite DNA â€“ long stretches of DNA made up of repeating
    elements called short tandem repeats (STRs)Â 
-   As individuals will likely have different numbers of repeats at a
    given satellite DNA locus, they will generate unique DNA profilesÂ 

Comparative STR Lengths at Two Specific Loci

[STR]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of DNA profiling in paternity and forensic investigations

Â  Â Â 
DNA profiling is commonly used in criminal investigations (forensics)
and to settle paternity disputes

The procedure involved is common for both:

-   A DNA sample is collected (e.g. from blood, semen, saliva, etc.) and
    then amplified using PCR
-   Satellite DNA (with STR sequences) are cut with specific restriction
    enzymes to generate fragments
-   Fragment length will differ between individuals due to the variable
    length of their short tandem repeats
-   The fragments are separated using gel electrophoresis and the
    resulting profiles are compared

Forensic Investigations:

Suspects should be a complete match with the DNA sample taken from the
crime scene if a conviction is to occur

The number of loci used to generate a unique profile depends on the size
of the population being compared

-   E.g. AmericaÂ (population: ~ 320 million) usesÂ 13Â loci for
    comparison; Australia (population: ~ 25 million) uses onlyÂ 9Â loci

Paternity Testing:

Children inherit half their chromosomes from each parent and thus should
possess a combination of parental fragments

-   In other words, all fragments produced in the child should also be
    produced by either the mother or father

Examples of GMOs

GMOs (genetically modified organisms) have been artificially manipulated
through genetic engineering to express new traits

There are a number of possible applications for the genetic modification
of organisms:

-   Agricultural crops are commonly modified to improve yield, growth
    rates and nutritional value
-   Genetically modified animals may be used to grow human transplant
    tissues and organs (xenotransplantation)
-   A number of microorganisms are being considered as future clean fuel
    producers andÂ biodegraders
-   Pharmaceutical companies are exploring the possibilities of
    introducing vaccines, antibodies and medicines into foods

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gel electrophoresis is used to separate proteins or fragments of
DNA according to size

Â  Â Â 
Gel electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to separate and
isolate proteins or DNA fragments based on mass / size

-   Samples are placed in a block of gel and an electric current is
    appliedÂ which causes the samples to move through the gel
-   Smaller samples are less impeded by the gel matrix and hence will
    move faster through the gel
-   This causes samples of different sizes to separate as they travel at
    different speeds

Overview of Gel Electrophoresis

This browser cannot play the embedded video file.

While both DNA and proteins are separated according to the same basic
process, differences exist between the two protocols

DNA Separation

-   DNA may be cut into fragments using restrictionÂ endonuclease â€“
    different DNA samples will generate different fragment lengths
-   Fragments separate because DNA is negatively charged due to the
    presence of aÂ phosphate group (PO₄^(3â€“)) on each nucleotide
-   DNA samples are placed into an agarose gel and fragment size
    calculated by comparing against known industry standards
-   Specific sequences can be identified by incorporating a
    complementary radiolabelled hybridisation probe, transferring the
    separated sequences to a membrane and then visualising via
    autoradiography (Southern blotting)

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (DNA)

[Electrophoresis (DNA)]

Protein Separation

-   Proteins may be folded into a variety of shapes (affecting size) and
    have positive and negative regions (no clear charge)
-   Proteins must first be treated with an anionic detergent (SDS) in
    order to linearise and impart a uniform negative charge
-   Protein samples are placed into a polyacrylamide gel and sizes
    compared against known industry standards
-   Separated proteins are transferred to a membrane and then target
    proteins are identified by staining with specific monoclonal
    antibodies (Western blotting)

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (Proteins)

[Electrophoresis (protein)]
Gene Silencing

Gene silencing refers to the ability of a cell to prevent the expression
of a particular gene

-   While this occurs naturally, it can also be induced by scientists to
    study gene interactions and potentially treat inherited diseases

Conditional Knockouts

A gene knockout is a genetic technique whereby a specific gene is
rendered inoperative within an organism

-   Using the Cre-LoxP system, this gene knockout can be targeted to
    specific tissues within the organism (conditional knockout)

The Cre-LoxP system uses the enzyme Cre recombinase to remove genetic
sequences located between two Lox sites

-   Using recombinant DNA technology, LoxP sequences are inserted on
    either side of a gene of interest in a test animal
-   The Cre gene is inserted next to a tissue-specific promoter in
    another test animal
-   When the two animals are bred, the resulting offspring will possess
    LoxP sequences and a tissue-specific Cre recombinase
-   The Cre recombinase will remove the gene located between the Lox
    sites to create a conditional knockout for further study

Creating a Conditional Knockout with the LoxP-Cre System

[conditional knockout]

RNA Interference (RNAi)

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is
roughly 20 â€“ 25 base pairs in length

siRNA interferes with the expression of genes by causing the mRNA
transcripts to be broken prior to translation

-   Â When theÂ siRNA is unwound, one strand (the passenger strand) is
    degraded and one strand (the guide strand) remains
-   The guide strand will hybridise to its complementary mRNA sequence
    and recruit a protein complex called RISC
-   RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) will then destroy the targeted
    mRNA, preventing translation of the associated gene

RNA Interference withÂ siRNA

[RNA interference]
Gene Therapy

Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individualâ€™s cells to
treat hereditary diseases by replacing defective alleles

-   It differs from standard transgenic practices in that it is intended
    to transform existing organisms rather than create new ones
-   Viral vectors are typically used, due to their ability to integrate
    DNA into the hostâ€™s genome
-   The process involves removing cells from a patient and using a viral
    vector to introduce aÂ functional copy of the defective gene
-   When the cells are transplanted back into the patient, they should
    begin expressing the missing protein to restore normal healthÂ 

An example of the successful use of gene therapy in humans is in the
treatment of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiencyÂ 

-   ADA deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease that causes severe
    combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in sufferers
-   The disorder results from an inability to synthesise the enzyme ADA,
    which is needed for the safe breakdown of a toxic chemical
-   Individuals who have undergone gene therapy have shown a steady
    increase in the levels of ADA in their cells

Gene Transfer

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gene modification is carried out by gene transfer between species

Â  Â Â 
A gene determines a particular trait by encoding for a specific
polypeptide in a given organism

Because the genetic code is (almost) universal, an organism can
potentially express a new trait if the appropriate gene is introduced
into its genome

The transfer of genes between species is called gene modification, and
the new organism created is called a transgenic

Genetic Modification: Bacteria Producing Human Insulin

[insulin production]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Gene transfer to bacteria using plasmids makes use of restriction
endonucleases and DNA ligase

Â  Â Â 
The process of gene transfer can be summarised in four key steps:

1.  Isolation of gene and vector (by PCR)
2.  Digestion of gene and vector (by restrictionÂ endonuclease)
3.  Ligation of gene and vector (by DNA ligase)
4.  Selection and expression of transgenic construct

Step 1: Â Isolating gene and vector

-   DNA can be isolated from cells by centrifugation â€“ whereby heavier
    components such as nuclei are separated
-   The gene of interest can then be specifically amplified via the
    polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
-   Gene sequences can also be generated from mRNA using reverse
    transcriptase â€“ these DNA sequences (cDNA) lack introns
-   A vector is a DNA molecule that is used as a vehicle to carry the
    gene of interest into a foreign cell
-   Bacterial plasmids are commonly used as vectors because they are
    capable of autonomous self-replication and expression
-   These plasmids may be modified for further functionality (e.g.
    selection markers, reporter genes, inducible expression promoters)Â 
-   Other types of vectors include modified viruses and artificial
    chromosomes

Common Features of a Typical Plasmid Vector

[plasmid vector]

Step 2: Â Digestion with Restriction Enzymes

-   In order to incorporate a gene of interest into a vector, both must
    be cut with restrictionÂ enzymes at specific recognition sites
-   Restriction enzymes cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone to generate
    blunt ends or sticky ends (complementary overhangs)
-   Scientists will often cleave the vector and gene with two
    differentÂ â€˜sticky endâ€™Â restriction endonucleases (double
    digestion) to ensure the gene is inserted in the correct orientation
    and to prevent the vector from re-annealing without the desired
    insert

â€˜Sticky Endâ€™Â vsÂ â€˜Blunt Endâ€™Â Restriction Enzymes

[restriction enzymes]

Step 3: Â Ligation of Vector and Insert

-   The gene of interest is inserted into a plasmid vector that has been
    cut with the same restrictionÂ endonucleases
-   This occurs because the sticky ends of the gene and vector overlap
    via complementary base pairing
-   The gene and vector are then spliced together by the enzyme DNA
    ligase to form a recombinant construct
-   DNA ligase joins the vector and gene by fusing their sugar-phosphate
    backbones together with a covalent phosphodiester bond

Formation of a Recombinant Construct

[DNA Ligation]

Step 4: Â Selection and Expression

-   The recombinant construct (including the gene of interest) is
    finally introduced into an appropriate host cell or organism
-   This process can be achieved in a variety of ways and is called
    transfection (for eukaryotes) or transformation (for prokaryotes)
-   Antibiotic selection is commonly used in order to identify which
    cells have successfully incorporated the recombinant construct
-   The plasmid vector contains an antibiotic resistance gene, so only
    transgenic cells will grow in the presence of antibiotic
-   Transgenic cells, once isolated and purified, will hopefully begin
    expressing the desired trait encoded by the gene of interest

Application:

â€¢ Â Assessment of the potential risks and benefits associated with the
genetic modification of crops

Â  Â Â 
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are used in agriculture to improve
crop yields and reduce farming costs

-   However the use of GM crops is a contentious issue, as economic
    benefits must be weighed against environmental risks

GM Crops and Human Health

-   GM crops can be used to improve human nutritional standards, by
    incorporating genes for certain proteins, vitamin or vaccines
-   Additionally, GM crops can be manufactured that lack common natural
    allergens or toxins
-   However, the inclusion or removal of certain genes could trigger
    unexpected adverse health reactions in some individuals
-   Currently, not all foods with GM components are labelled, making
    informed decisions of use difficult for consumers

GM Crops andÂ Economic Consequences

-   GM crops can include genes to enable them to grow in a wider range
    of environments (e.g. drought / frost / salinity resistance)
-   GM crops can be manufactured to produce greater yields (crops can
    potentially grow larger and faster)
-   GM crops can include genes which slow the rate of spoiling, leading
    to longer shelf lives for GM foods
-   GM crops may possess resistance to certain viruses or produce toxins
    to pests (reducing need for the use of pesticides)
-   Herbicide resistant crops can be used to allow for the easier
    killing of weeds (which compete with crops for soil nutrients)
-   Overall, an improved yield, reduction in farming costs and ability
    to farm more land will provide an economic benefit to farmers
-   However, patent protection allows biotech companies to restrict the
    use of seeds and force farmers to pay high prices for use

GM Crops and Environmental Issues

-   The ability to farm a wider range of environments with GM crops will
    potentially reduce the need for associated deforestation
-   Also, the generation of pest-resistant crops means that less
    chemical insecticides will be released into the environment
-   However, GM crops could potentially reduce biodiversity in a region
    by competing with indigenous plant life
-   Furthermore, proteins or toxins produced by GM crops could
    negatively affect certain organisms within the ecosystem
-   Cross-pollination by GM crops could also result in the formation of
    herbicide-resistant weeds and grasses
-   GM crops with pest toxins could also accelerate the evolution of
    resistant pest species

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data on risks to monarch butterflies of Bt crops

Â  Â Â 
Bt corn is a genetically modified maize that incorporates an insecticide
producing gene from the bacterium BacillusÂ thuringiensis

-   This insecticide is lethal to certain types of larvae, particularly
    the European corn borer which would otherwise eat the crop

Concerns have been raised that the spread of Bt corn may also be
impacting the survival rates of monarch butterflies

-   While monarch butterfly larva feed exclusively on milkweed,
    wind-borne pollen from Bt corn may dust nearby milkweeds

Relationship between Bt Corn and the Monarch Butterfly

[Bt corn]

In 1999, a preliminary study was conducted investigating the association
between exposure to Bt corn pollen and survivor rates among monarch
caterpillars:

-   Monarch caterpillars were fed milkweed leaves that had been dusted
    with pollen from Bt corn (to simulate spread via wind)
-   Growth and mortality rates were compared against caterpillars fed on
    non-dusted leaves or leaves dusted with non-GM pollen
-   Caterpillars exposed to Bt pollen were found to have eaten less,
    grew more slowly and exhibited higher mortality rates

Effect of Bt Pollen on Survival Rates of Monarch Butterflies (Laboratory
Conditions)

[Bt graph 1]

Some scientists suggested that these results may lack validity as they
do not accurately reflect natural conditions:

-   There were higher amounts of Bt pollen on the leaves than would be
    found naturally (e.g. rain would diminish build up)
-   Larva were restricted in their diet (in the field, larva could
    feasibly avoid eating pollen dusted leaves)

A second study was conducted comparing the survivor rates of monarch
butterflies based on proximity to Bt corn fields:

-   There was no significant increase in mortality when monarch larva
    were placed in or near an actual Bt corn field
-   From this it was concluded that exposure to Bt pollen poses no
    significant risk to monarch butterfly populationsÂ

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Many plant species and some animal species have natural methods of
cloning

Â  Â Â 
Many species can reproduce asexually and hence possess natural methods
of cloning

-   All bacteria, the majority of fungi and many species of protists
    reproduce asexually to produce genetic clones
-   While most plants reproduce sexually, they also possess methods of
    asexual reproduction (vegetative propagation)
-   Certain animal species can also reproduce asexually, via a variety
    of different mechanisms

Animal Cloning Methods

Binary Fission

-   The parent organism divides equally in two, so as to produce two
    genetically identical daughter organisms
-   This method of cloning occurs inÂ Planaria (flatworms) but is also
    common to bacteria and protists (e.g. euglena, amoeba)

Budding

-   Cells split off the parent organism, generating a smaller daughter
    organism which eventually separates from the parent
-   This method of cloning occurs in Hydra but is also common to many
    species of yeast

Fragmentation

-   New organisms grow from a separated fragment of the parent organism
-   This method of cloning is common to starfish and certain species of
    annelid worms

Parthenogenesis

-   Embryos are formed from unfertilised ova (via the production of a
    diploid egg cells by the female)
-   This method of cloning occurs in certain species of insect, fish,
    amphibians and reptiles

Examples of Animal Cloning Methods

[animal cloning methods]

Plant Cloning Methods

Plants have the capacity for vegetative propagation, whereby small
pieces can be induced to grow independently

-   This is because adult plants possess meristematic tissue capable of
    cellular differentiation (totipotent)Â 

Virtually all types of roots and shoots are capable of vegetative
propagation

-   Garlic and onion bulbs are modified plant leaves â€“ all the bulbs
    in a group are genetically identical
-   Underground stems (e.g. potato tubers) can form new plants which are
    geneticallyÂ identical to the parent plant
-   Certain plants can form horizontal stems called runners (or stolons)
    that grow roots and develop into clones

Some plants (mainly algae, mosses and ferns) can reproduce asexually by
producing spores

-   Spores are also produced by certain types of bacteria and fungi

Vegetative Propagation via Plant Stolons

[stolons]

Human Cloning Methods

Even human beings are capable of creating genetic clones through natural
means

-   Identical twinsÂ (monozygotic)Â are created when a fertilised egg
    (zygote) splits into two identical cells, each forming an embryo
-   Non-identical twins (dizygotic) are created when an unfertilised egg
    splits into two cells and each is fertilised by a different sperm
-   Identical twins will be clones of one another (genetically
    identical), while non-identical twins will share 50% of the same DNA

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â PCR can be used to amplify small amounts of DNA

Â  Â Â 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an artificial method of
replicating DNA under laboratory conditions

-   The PCR technique is used to amplify large quantities of a specific
    sequence of DNA from an initial minute sample
-   Each reaction cycle doubles the amount of DNA â€“ a standard PCR
    sequence of 30 cycles creates over 1 billion copies (2³⁰)

Stages of PCR

PCR occurs in a thermal cycler and uses variations in temperature to
control the replication process via three steps:

1.  DenaturationÂ â€“ DNA sample is heated to separate it into two
    single strandsÂ (~95ÂºC for 1 min)
2.  AnnealingÂ â€“ DNA primers attach to the 3â€™Â ends of the target
    sequence (~55ÂºC for 1 min)
3.  ElongationÂ â€“ A heat-tolerant DNA polymerase (Taq) binds to the
    primer and copies the strand (~72ÂºC for 2 min)

Once large quantities of DNA have been created, other laboratory
techniques are used to isolate and manipulate the sequences

Skill:

â€¢ Â Design of an experiment to assess one factor affecting the rooting
of stem cuttings

Â  Â Â 
A stem cutting is a separated portion of plant stem that can regrow into
a new independent clone via vegetative propagation

-   All stems possessÂ nodes, from which a leaf, branch or aerial root
    may grow â€“ the region between nodes are called internodes
-   Stem cuttings are typically placed in soil with the lower nodes
    covered and the upper nodes exposed
-   Stem cutting is a common method employed to rapidly propagate plant
    species (including sugar cane, grapes and roses)

There are a variety of factors that will influence successful rooting of
a stem cutting, including:

-   Cutting position (whether cutting occurs above or below a node, as
    well as the relative proximity of the cut to the node)
-   Length of cutting (including how many nodes remain on the cutting)
-   Growth medium (whether left in soil, water, potting mix, compost or
    open air)
-   The use and concentration of growth hormones (e.g. IAA, IBA and NAA
    promote the formation of adventitious roots)
-   Temperature conditions (most cuttings grow optimally at temperatures
    common to spring and summer)
-   Availability of water (either in the form of ground water or
    humidity)
-   Other environmental conditions (including pH of the soil and light
    exposure)

Germination of Stem Cuttings

[stem cuttings]
Vector Delivery

In molecular biology, a vector is a vehicle that is used to deliver
genetic material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer

There are several methods for transferring genetic material, but all
mechanisms can be classed as either viral or non-viral

Non-Viral Delivery

A commonly used vector is a plasmid â€“ a circular DNA molecule capable
of self-replication and autonomous protein expression

Plasmids can be introduced to target cells by a variety of means,
including:

-   Electroporation â€“ An electric current is applied to make temporary
    holes in the cell membrane
-   Heat shocking â€“ Thermal energy is used to briefly destabilise the
    cell membrane to allow for vector entry
-   Particle bombardment â€“ DNA-coated particles are shot into the
    cells by a gene gun
-   Microinjection â€“ A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector
    directly into the cell
-   Lipofection â€“ The vector is transferred within a liposome (a
    vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)

Viral Delivery

The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and
utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell

Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can
have both beneficial and detrimental consequences

-   The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be
    driven by endogenous expression patterns
-   A disadvantage of this practice is that there is a risk the random
    insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes

Viruses can have either a DNA genome (adenovirus) or an RNA genome
(retrovirus)

-   Retroviruses use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert
    the RNA sequence into a DNA copy prior to integration

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Autotrophs obtain inorganic nutrients from the abiotic environment

Â  Â Â 
Autotrophs synthesise organic molecules from simple inorganic substances

-   Most autotrophs derive the energy for this process from sunlight
    (via photosynthesis)
-   Some may derive the needed energy from the oxidation of inorganic
    chemicals (chemosynthesis)

Autotrophs obtain the simple inorganic substances required for this
process from the abiotic environment

-   These nutrients â€“ including carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and
    phosphorus â€“ are obtained from the air, water and soil

Heterotrophs also may obtain some simple inorganic substances from the
environment, but principally obtain their carbon and nitrogen from the
organic molecules produced by autotrophs

Chi Squared Table

A chi-squared table shows the distribution of critical values according
to each degree of freedom

-   This allows for an assessment to be made as to whether the data is
    statistically significant (p<0.05) or not

For accurate data, the following conditions should be met:

-   All items in the group should be independent and collected on a
    random basis
-   No group should contain very few items (e.g. less than 10)
-   The total number of items should be large (e.g. more than 50)

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Testing for association between two species using the chi-squared
test with data obtained by quadrat sampling

Â  Â Â 
The presence of two species within a given environment will be dependent
upon potential interactions between them
If two species are typically found within the same habitat, they show a
positive association

-   Species that show a positive association include those that exhibit
    predator-prey or symbiotic relationships

If two species tend not to occur within the same habitat, they show a
negative association

-   Species will typically show a negative association if there is
    competition for the same resources
    -   One species may utilise the resources more efficiently,
        precluding survival of the other species (competitive exclusion)
    -   Both species may alter their use of the environment to avoid
        direct competition (resource partitioning)

If two species do not interact, there will be no association between
them and their distribution will be independent of one another

Quadrat Sampling

The presence of two species within a given environment can be determined
using quadrat sampling

-   A quadrat is a rectangular frame of known dimensions that can be
    used to establish population densities
    -   Quadrats are placed inside a defined area in either a random
        arrangement or according to a design (e.g. belted transect)
    -   The number of individuals of a given species is either counted
        or estimated via percentage coverage
    -   The sampling process is repeated many times in order to gain a
        representative data set

Quadrat sampling is not an effective method for counting motile
organisms â€“ it is used for counting plants and sessile animals

-   In eachÂ quadrat, the presence or absence of each species is
    identified
-   This allows for the number of quadrats where both species were
    present to be compared against the total number ofÂ quadrats

Quadrat Sampling Method

[quadrats]

Chi-Squared Tests

A chi-squared test can be applied to data generated fromÂ quadrat
sampling to determine if there is a statistically significant
association between the distribution of two species

A chi-squared test can be completed by following five simple steps:

-   Identify hypotheses (null versus alternative)
-   Construct a table of frequencies (observed versus expected)
-   Apply the chi-squared formula
-   Determine the degree of freedom (df)
-   Identify the p value (should be <0.05)

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Recognising and interpreting statistical significance

Â  Â Â 
Example of Chi-Squared Test Application

The presence or absence of two species of scallop was recorded in fifty
quadrats (1m²) on a rocky sea shoreÂ 

The following distribution pattern was observed:

-   6Â quadrats = both species Â ; Â 15 quadrats = king scallop only Â ;
    Â 20 quadrats = queen scallop only Â ; Â 9Â quadrats = neither
    speciesÂ 

[chi1]

Step 1:Â Â Identify hypotheses

A chi-squared test seeks to distinguish between two distinct
possibilities and hence requires two contrasting hypotheses:

-   Null hypothesis (H₀):Â There isÂ noÂ significant difference between
    the distribution of two species (i.e. distribution is random)
-   Alternative hypothesis (H₁):Â ThereÂ isÂ a significant difference
    between the distribution of species (i.e. species are associated)

Step 2:Â Â Construct a table of frequencies

A table must be constructed that identifies expected distribution
frequencies for each species (for comparison against observed)

Expected frequencies are calculated according to the following
formula:Â 

-   Expected frequency = (Row totalÂ Ã— Column total)Â Ã· Grand total

[chi2]

Step 3:Â Â Apply the chi-squared formula

The formula used to calculate a statistical value for the chi-squared
test is as follows:

[]

Where: Â âˆ‘Â = Sum Â ; Â O = Observed frequency Â ; Â E = Expected
frequency
These calculations can be broken down for each part of the distribution
pattern to make the final summation easier

[chi3]

Based on these results the statistical value calculated by the
chi-squared test is as follows:

-   ð??Œ²Â  = Â (2.20 + 2.38 + 1.59 + 1.73) Â = Â 7.90

Step 4:Â Â Determine the degree of freedom (df)

In order to determine if the chi-squared value is statistically
significant a degree of freedom must first be identified

-   The degree of freedom is a mathematical restriction that designates
    what range of values fall within each significance levelÂ 

The degree of freedom is calculated from the table of frequencies
according to the following formula:

df = (m â€“ 1) (n â€“ 1)Â 

Where: Â mÂ = number of rows Â ; Â nÂ = number of columns

-   When the distribution patterns for two species are being compared,
    the degree of freedom should always be 1

Step 5:Â Â Identify the p value

The final step is to apply the value generated to a chi-squared
distribution table to determine if results are statistically significant

-   A value is considered significant if there is less than a 5%
    probability (p < 0.05) the results are attributable to chance

[chi4]

When df = 1, a value of greater than 3.841 is required for results to be
considered statistically significant (p < 0.05)

-   A value of 7.90 lies above a p value of 0.01, meaning there is less
    than a 1% probability results are caused by chance
-   Hence, the difference between observed and expected frequencies
    areÂ statistically significant

As the results are statistically significant, the null hypothesis is
rejected and the alternate hypothesis accepted:

-   Alternate hypothesis (H₁):Â There isÂ a significant difference
    between observed and expected frequencies
-   Because the two species do not tend to be present in the same area,
    we can infer there is a negative association between them

Practice Question

[question] Two species of fir tree are found along the coast of Southern
California.
These two tree species are the Grand Fir (Abies grandis) and the Noble
Fir (Abies procera).
Their distribution patterns were establsihed via 150 quadrat samples,
yielding the following results:
25 = both present ; 30 = Noble Fir only ; 45 = Grand Fir only ; 50
neither present
Activity: Use the chi-squared test to determine if these two plant
species show association.

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Consumers are heterotrophs that feed on living organisms by
ingestion

Â  Â Â 
Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules from other organisms via different
feeding mechanisms and different food sources

-   Consequently, heterotrophs can be differentially classified
    according to their feeding pattern

Consumers

Consumers are heterotrophs that feed on living organisms by ingestion

-   Herbivores are consumers that feed principally on plant matter (e.g.
    cows, sheep, rabbits)
-   Carnivores are consumers that feed principally on animal matter
    (e.g. crocodiles, wolves, tigers)
-   Omnivores are consumers that have a principle diet composed of both
    plant and animal matter (e.g. pandas, humans)

[consumer]

Scavengers

Scavengers are a type of consumer that principally feed on dead and
decaying carcasses rather than hunting live prey

-   Examples of scavengers include hyenas, vultures and carrion birds
    (such as crows)

detritus via internal digestion

Â  Â Â 
Detritivores

Detritivores are a type of heterotroph that obtains nutrients from
non-living organic sources, such as detritus and humus

-   Detritus is dead, particulate organic matter â€“ such as decaying
    organic material and fecal matter
-   Humus is the term given specifically to the decaying leaf litter
    intermixed within the topsoil
-   Detritivores include dung beetles, earthworms, woodlice, snails and
    crabs

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Saprotrophs are heterotrophs that obtain organic nutrients from
dead organisms by external digestion

Â  Â Â 
Saprotrophs

Saprotrophs live on (or in) non-living organic matter, secrete digestive
enzymes into it and absorbing the products of digestion

-   Unlike other types of heterotrophs, saprotrophs do not ingest food
    but use enzymatic secretion to facilitate external digestion
-   Because saprotrophs facilitate the breakdown of dead organic
    material, they are commonly referred to as decomposers
-   Examples of saprotrophs include bacteria and fungi

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ecosystems have the potential to be sustainable over long periods
of time

Â  Â Â 
Ecosystems describe the interaction between biotic components (i.e.
communities) and abiotic components (i.e. habitat)

-   They are largely self-contained and have the capacity to be
    self-sustaining over long periods of time

There are three main components required for sustainability in an
ecosystem:

-   Energy availability â€“ light from the sun provides the initial
    energy source for almost all communities
-   Nutrient availability â€“ saprotrophic decomposers ensure the
    constant recycling of inorganic nutrients within an environment
-   Recycling of wastes â€“ certain bacteria can detoxify harmful waste
    byproducts (e.g. denitrifying bacteria such as Nitrosomonas)

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Setting up sealed mesocosms to try to establish sustainability

Â  Â Â 
Mesocosms are enclosed environments that allow a small part of a natural
environment to be observed under controlled conditions

-   A terrarium is a small transparent container (e.g. glass or plastic)
    in which selected plants (or animals) are kept and observed

Making a Self-Sustaining Terrarium

A terrarium can be created using a glass or plastic bottle with a lid,
according to the following steps:

1.  Building a verdant foundation

-   Add a bottom layer of pebbles, gravel or sand â€“ this layer exists
    for drainage (smaller vessels require thinner rock layers)
-   Add a second thin layer of activated charcoal â€“ this will prevent
    mold and help to aerate the soil
-   Spread a thin cover of sphagnum moss (or use an organic coffee
    filter) to create a barrier between the lower layers and soil
-   The final layer is the pre-moistened growing medium (i.e. potting
    mix)

1.  Selecting the right plants

-   Ideally, choose plants that are both slow growing and thrive in a
    bit of humidity (e.g. most ferns, club moss, etc.)
-   Inspect the plant thoroughly for any signs of disease or insects
    before introducing to the terrarium

1.  Maintaining appropriate conditions

-   Ensure the terrarium is placed in a location that provides a
    continuous source of light
-   Locate the terrarium in a place that does not experience fluctuating
    temperature conditions (i.e. avoid direct sunlight)
-   Do not initially over-water the plants â€“ once the right humidity
    is established, a terrarium can go months without watering
-   Occasional pruning may be required â€“ however, as level of soil
    nutrients decrease, plant growth should slow down

Modes of Nutrition

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Species have either an autotrophic or heterotrophic method of
nutrition (a few species have both methods)

Â  Â Â 
Living organisms obtain chemical energy in one of two ways:

Autotrophs

-   Synthesises its own organic molecules from simple inorganic
    substances (e.g. CO₂, nitrates)
-   Energy for this process is derived from sunlight (photosynthesis) or
    via the oxidation of inorganic molecules (chemosynthesis)
-   Because autotrophs synthesise their own organic molecules they are
    commonly referred to as producers

Heterotrophs

-   Obtains organic molecules from other organisms (either living /
    recently killed or their non-living remains and detritus)
-   Because heterotrophs cannot produce their own organic molecules and
    obtain it from other sources, they are called consumers

Mixotrophs

-   Certain unicellular organisms may on occasion use both forms of
    nutrition, depending on resource availability
-   Euglena gracilis possess chlorophyll for photosynthesis
    (autotrophic) but may also feed on detritus (heterotrophic)

[ninja icon]

Skill:

â€¢ Â Classifying species as autotrophs, consumers, detritivores or
saprotrophs based on their mode of nutrition

Â  Â Â 
Species can be classified according to their mode of nutrition

-   Autotrophs produce their own organic molecules using either light
    energy or energy derived from the oxidation of chemicals
-   Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules from other organisms via one
    of three methods:
    -   Consumers ingest organic molecules from living or recently
        killed organisms
    -   Detritivores ingest organic molecules found in the non-living
        remnants of organisms (e.g. detritus, humus)
    -   Saprotrophs release digestive enzymes and then absorb the
        external products of digestion (decomposers)

Classifying Different Modes of Nutrition

[modes of nutrition]
Niches

An ecological niche describes the functional position and role of an
organism within its environment

An ecological niche will be comprised of various components, including:

-   The habitat in which the organism lives
-   The activity patterns of the organism (e.g. periods of time during
    which it is active)
-   The resources it obtains from the environment (e.g. food source,
    territorial boundaries, etc.)
-   The interactions that occur with other species in the region (e.g.
    competition / predator-prey relationships)

Types of Niches

Some species may not be able to occupy their entire niche due to the
presence or absence of other species

-   The fundamental niche is the entire set of conditions under which an
    organism can survive and reproduce (i.e. where it can live)
-   The realised niche is the set of conditions actually used by a given
    organism after interactions with other species are taken into
    account (i.e. where it does live)

Fundamental versus Realised Niche

[fundamental vs realised niche]

Niche Differentiation

Niche differentiation describes the way by which competing species use
the environment differently in order to exist

If two species with identical niches compete, two distinct outcomes are
possible:

-   Competitive exclusion: Â One species will use the resources more
    efficiently and drive the other species to local extinction
-   Resource partitioning: Â Two species will alter their use of the
    niche to avoid direct competition, allowing for co-existence

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The supply of inorganic nutrients is maintained by nutrient
cycling

Â  Â Â 
Nutrients refer to the material required by an organism, and include
elements such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus

-   The supply of inorganic nutrients on Earth is finite â€“ new
    elements cannot simply be created and so are in limited supply

Hence chemical elements are constantly recycled after they are used:

-   Autotrophs obtain inorganic nutrients from the air, water and soil
    and convert them into organic compounds
-   Heterotrophs ingest these organic compounds and use them for growth
    and respiration, releasing inorganic byproducts
-   When organisms die, saprotrophs decompose the remains and free
    inorganic materials into the soil
-   The return of inorganic nutrients to the soil ensures the continual
    supply of raw materials for the autotrophsÂ 

Nutrient Cycling

Species

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Species are groups of organisms that can potentially interbreed to
produce fertile offspring

â€¢ Â Members of a species may be reproductively isolated in separate
populations

Â  Â Â 
A species is a group of organisms that can potentially interbreed to
produce fertile, viable offspring

-   Members of a single species are unable to produce fertile, viable
    offspring with members from a different species
-   When two different species do produce offspring by cross-breeding,
    these hybrids areÂ reproductively sterile (e.g. liger, mule)

A population is a group of organisms of the same species that are living
in the same area at the same timeÂ 

-   Organisms that live in different regions (i.e. different
    populations) are reproductively isolated and unlikely to interbreed,
    however are classified as the same species if interbreeding is
    functionally possible

Species Comparisons

[species]
Species Interactions

In nature no species exists in total isolation â€“ all organisms
interact with both the abiotic environment and other organisms

-   If two species interact directly within a shared environment, they
    share a positive association (they co-exist)
-   If interactions within an environment are mutually detrimental to
    both species, they share a negative association (do not co-exist)

Positive Associations

1. Â Predator-Prey Relationships

-   Predation is a biological interaction whereby one organism
    (predator) hunts and feeds on another organism (prey)
-   Because the predator relies on the prey as a food source, their
    population levels are inextricably intertwined
    -   If the prey population drops (e.g. due to over-feeding),
        predator numbers will dwindle as intra-specific competition
        increases
    -   If the prey population rises, predator numbers will increase as
        a result of the over-abundance of a food source

Predator-Prey Relationships (Arctic Fox vs Snowshoe Hare)

[predator-prey]

2. Â Symbiotic Relationships

-   Symbiosis describes the close and persistent (long-term) interaction
    between two species
-   Symbiotic relationships can be obligate (required for survival) or
    facultative (advantageous without being strictly necessary)
-   Symbiotic relationships can be beneficial to either one or both
    organisms in the partnership:
    -   Mutualism â€“ Both species benefit from the interaction (anemone
        protects clownfish, clownfish provides fecal matter for food)
    -   Commensalism â€“ One species benefits, the other is unaffected
        (barnacles are transported to plankton-rich waters by whales)
    -   Parasitism â€“ One species benefits to the detriment of the
        other species (ticks and fleas feed on the blood of their canine
        host) Â 

Types of Symbiotic Relationships

[symbiosis]

Negative Associations

1. Â Competition

-   Competition describes the interaction between two organisms whereby
    the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of the other
-   Competition can beÂ intraspecific (between members of same species)
    or interspecific (between members of different species)
-   Limited supplies of resources (e.g. food, water, territory) usually
    triggers one of two types of responses:
    -   Competitive exclusion â€“ One species uses the resources more
        efficiently, driving the other species to local extinction
    -   Resource partitioning â€“ Both species alter their use of the
        environment to divide the resources between them

Competitive Exclusion vs Resource Partitioning

[niche differentiation]
Types of Metabolism

All living things undergo metabolism and may be classified according to
three key conditions:

-   The method by which they obtain their carbon
-   The method by which they derive their energy
-   The method by which they generate reducing equivalents

1. Â Carbon Source

Organisms can obtain carbon for synthesising organic molecules by own of
three means:

-   Autotrophic â€“ Carbon is obtained from inorganic compounds (e.g.
    CO₂)
-   Heterotrophic â€“ Carbon is obtained from organic compounds (e.g.
    sugars)
-   Mixotrophic â€“ Carbon may be obtained from either inorganic or
    organic sources

2. Â Energy Source

Organisms can derive the energy they need for living and growing by one
of two means:

-   Phototrophic â€“ The energy is obtained from sunlight
-   Chemotrophic â€“ The energy is obtained from externally derived
    chemical compoundsÂ 

3. Â Reducing Equivalents

Reducing equivalents are chemical species that can transfer electrons
needed for energy conversions and biosynthesis

Organisms can obtain reducing equivalents from one of two sources:

-   Lithotrophic â€“ Electrons are derived from inorganic compounds
    (e.g. H₂, NH₃, CO, H₂S, SO₄²⁻, Fe)
-   Organotrophic â€“ Electrons are derived from organic compounds (e.g.
    carbohydrates, proteins, lipids)

These terms can be combined to describe the organism â€“ e.g.
photolithoautotrophs (plants), chemoorganoheterotrophs (animals)

Types of Metabolism

[modes of metabolism]
Biomagnification

Because energy transformations are only ~10% efficient, higher trophic
levels must consume more prey to meet energy needs

If a pollutant is ingested by living organisms, it will become
concentrated at higher trophic levels as they eat more exposed prey

-   The increase of a substance (such as a pollutant) in a particular
    organisms is called bioaccumulation
-   The increase in the concentration of a substance at a particular
    trophic level is called biomagnification

Bioaccumulation refers to how pollutants enter a food chain, whereas
biomagnification refers to the tendency of pollutants to concentrate as
they move from one trophic level to the next
Because pollutants become concentrated by biomagnification, higher
trophic levels are more susceptible to their toxic effects

-   The pesticide DDT caused egg-shell thinning and population declines
    in species of birds that fed on exposed insectsÂ 
-   Heavy metals (like mercury) released into waterways via industrial
    processes may become concentrated in fish

Ecological Productivity

In ecology, production (or productivity) refers to the rate of
generation of biomass in an ecosystem

-   It is usually expressed in units of mass per area per time (e.g. kg
    m^(â€“2) day^(â€“1))

Primary Production

Primary production describes the production of chemical energy in
organic compounds by producers

-   The main source of energy for primary production is sunlight, but a
    fraction may be driven by chemosynthesis byÂ lithotrophs

Primary production may be categorised as one of two types:

-   Gross primary production (GPP) is the amount of chemical energy as
    biomass that a producer creates in a given length of time
-   Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of chemical energy that
    is not consumed by respiration (NPP = GPP â€“ respiration)

Secondary Production

Secondary production describes the generation of biomass by
heterotrophic organisms (consumers)

-   This biomass generation is driven by the transfer of organic
    compounds between trophic levels via feeding
-   Secondary production may also be categorised according to gross
    (total) and net (usable) amounts of biomass

Ecological Productivity

[productivity]
Ecological Pyramids

Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of a specific component at
the different trophic levels of an ecosystem

-   The three main types of ecological pyramids measure species numbers,
    biomass and energy

Pyramid of Numbers

A pyramid of numbers shows the relative number of organisms at each
stage of a food chain

-   These are usually shaped like pyramids, as higher trophic levels
    cannot be sustained if there are more predators than prey
-   However, the shape may be distorted if a food source is
    disproportionately large in size / biomass compared to the feeder
    -   For example, a large number of caterpillars may feed on a single
        oak tree and many fleas may feed off a single dog host

Pyramid of Biomass

A pyramid of biomass shows the total mass of organisms at each stage of
a food chain

-   These pyramids are almost always upright in shape, as biomass
    diminishes along food chains as CO₂ and waste is released
-   An exception to this rule is found in marine ecosystems, where
    zooplankton have a large total biomass than phytoplankton
    -   This is because phytoplankton replace their biomass at such a
        rapid rate and so can support a larger biomass of zooplankton

Pyramid of Energy

A pyramid of energy shows the amount of energy trapped per area in a
given time period at each stage of a food chain

-   These pyramids are always upright in shape, as energy is lost along
    food chains (either used in respiration or lost as heat)
-   Each level in the pyramid will be roughly one tenth the size of the
    preceding level as energy transformations are ~10% efficient

Examples of Ecological Pyramids for a Specific Food Chain

Energy Efficiency

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Energy losses between trophic levels restrict the length of food
chains and the biomass of higher trophic levels

Â  Â Â 
When energy transformations take place in living organisms the process
is never 100% efficient

-   Most of the energy is lost to the organism â€“ either used in
    respiration, released as heat, excreted in faeces or unconsumed
-   Typically energy transformations are ~10% efficient, with about 90%
    of available energy lost between trophic levels
-   The amount of energy transferred depends on how efficiently
    organisms can capture and use energy (usually between 5 â€“ 20%)

As energy is lost between trophic levels, higher trophic levels store
less energy as carbon compounds and so have less biomass

-   Biomass is the total mass of a group of organisms â€“ consisting of
    the carbon compounds contained in the cells and tissues
-   Because carbon compounds store energy, scientists can measure the
    amount of energy added to organisms as biomass
-   Biomass diminishes along food chains with the loss of carbon
    dioxide, water and waste products (e.g. urea) to the environmentÂ 

Because energy and biomass is lost between each level of a food chain,
the number of potential trophic levels are limited

-   Higher trophic levels receive less energy / biomass from feeding and
    so need to eat larger quantities to obtain sufficient amounts
-   Because higher trophic levels need to eat more, they expend more
    energy (and biomass) hunting for food
-   If the energy required to hunt food exceeds the energy available
    from the food eaten, the trophic level becomes unviable

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chemical energy in carbon compounds flows through food chains by
means of feeding

Â  Â Â 
Energy enters most ecosystems as sunlight, where it is converted into
chemical energy by producers (via photosynthesis)

-   This chemical energy is stored in carbon compounds (organic
    molecules) and is transferred to heterotrophs via feeding

Trophic Levels

The position an organism occupies within a feeding sequence is known as
a trophic level

-   Producers always occupy the first trophic level in a feeding
    sequence
-   Primary consumers feed on producers and hence occupy the second
    trophic level
-   Further consumers (e.g. secondary, tertiary, etc.) may occupy
    subsequent trophic levels

The trophic levels in a community are:

[trophic level]

Food Chains

A food chain shows the linear feeding relationships between species in a
community

-   Arrows represent the transfer of energy and matter as one organism
    is eaten by another (arrows point in direction of energy flow)
-   The first organism in a food chain is always a producer, followed by
    consumers (primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Energy released from carbon compounds by respiration is used in
living organisms and converted to heat

Â  Â Â 
Energy stored in organic molecules (e.g. sugars and lipids) can be
released by cell respiration to produce ATP

-   This ATP is then used to fuel metabolic reactions required for
    growth and homeostasis
-   A by-product of these chemical reactions is heat (thermal energy),
    which is released from the organismÂ 

Not all energy stored in organic molecules is transferred via
heterotrophic feeding â€“ some of the chemical energy is lost by:

-   Being excreted as part of the organismâ€™s faeces
-   Remaining unconsumed as the uneaten portions of the food

Energy Transformations in Living Organisms

[energy forms]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Living organisms cannot convert heat to other forms of energy

â€¢ Â Heat is lost from ecosystems

Â  Â Â 
The chemical energy produced by an organism can be converted into a
number of forms, including:

-   Kinetic energy (e.g. during muscular contractions)
-   Electrical energy (e.g. during the transmission of nerve impulses)
-   Light energy (e.g. producing bioluminescence)

All of these reactions are exothermic and release thermal energy (heat)
as a by-product

-   Living organisms cannot turn this heat into other forms of usable
    energy
-   This heat energy is released from the organism and is lost from the
    ecosystem (unlike nutrients, which are recycled)
-   Hence ecosystems require a continuous influx of energy from an
    external source (such as the sun)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Most ecosystems rely on a supply of energy from sunlight

â€¢ Â Light energy is converted to chemical energy in carbon compounds
by photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 
All green plants, and some bacteria, are photoautotrophic â€“ they use
sunlight as a source of energy

-   This makes light the initial source of energy for almost all
    communities
-   In a few ecosystems the producers are chemoautotrophic bacteria,
    which use energy derived from chemical processes

Light energy is absorbed by photoautotrophs and is converted into
chemical energy via photosynthesis

-   This light energy is used to make organic compounds (e.g. sugars)
    from inorganic sources (e.g. CO₂)
-   Heterotrophs ingest these organic compounds in order to derive their
    chemical energy (ATP)
-   When organic compounds are broken down via cell respiration, ATP is
    produced to fuel metabolic processes

Overview of Photosynthesis

[photosynthesis overview]
Food Webs

A food web is a diagram that shows how food chains are linked together
into more complex feeding relationships
A food web is more representative of actual feeding pathways within an
ecosystem because:

-   Organisms can have more than one food source
-   Organisms can have more than one predator

This means that, unlike a food chain, organisms in a food web can occupy
more than one trophic level

-   Hint: When constructing food webs, position organisms at their
    highest trophic level (keeps all arrows pointing in same direction)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In aquatic ecosystems carbon is present as dissolved carbon
dioxide and hydrogen carbonate ions

Â  Â Â 

[carbon ocean]

Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and some of it will remain as a
dissolved gas, however the remainder will combine with water to form
carbonic acidÂ  (CO₂ + H₂O Â â‡„ Â H₂CO₃)

-   Carbonic acid will then dissociate to form hydrogen carbonate ions
    Â (H₂CO₃ Â â‡„ Â HCO₃^(â€“) + H⁺)
-   This conversion also releases hydrogen ions (H⁺), which is why pH
    changes when CO₂ is dissolved in water (> acidic)

Autotrophs absorb both dissolved carbon dioxide and hydrogen carbonate
ions and use them to produce organic compoundsÂ 

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Animals such as reef-building corals and mollusca have hard parts
that are composed of calcium carbonate

Â  Â  and can become fossilised in limestone

Â  Â Â 

When the hydrogen carbonate ions come into contact with the rocks and
sediments on the ocean floor, they acquire metal ions

-   This commonly results in the formation of calcium carbonate and the
    subsequent development of limestone

Living animals may also combine the hydrogen carbonate ions with calcium
to form calcium carbonate

-   This calcium carbonate forms the hardened exoskeleton of coral, as
    well as forming the main component of mollusca shells
-   When the organism dies and settles to the sea floor, these hard
    components may become fossilised in the limestone

Biofuels

Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source as they take several
million years to form through slow geological processes

-   Fossil fuels include coal (formed from peat) and oil and natural gas
    (e.g. petroleum)

Biofuels are liquid fuels that are produced from the structural
components (biomass) and waste of plant and animal matter

-   As they are derived from biological processes, they are functionally
    renewable (provided there is a constant stock of reagents)
-   Biofuels may use certain industrial wastes as reagents (e.g. CO₂,
    heat), making them an ecologically sustainable alternative
-   Biofuels include bioethanol and biodiesel, with efforts ongoing to
    develop better purification and refinement techniques

Biofuel Production (Using Algae)

[biofuel]
Biogeochemical Cycles

A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which a chemical substance moves
through the biotic and abiotic spheres of the Earth

-   While the carbon cycle is the most well known pathway, other
    biogeochemical cycles are equally important to life on Earth
-   These other biogeochemical processes include the nitrogen cycle,
    phosphorus cycle and sulphur cycle

Nitrogen Cycle

-   The majority of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere is composed on nitrogen gas
    (N₂ = ~79%) however it is chemically inert in this form
-   Atmospheric nitrogen must be chemically processed by nitrogen-fixing
    bacteria in order to be used by plants
-   Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil as nitrite ions, nitrate ions
    or ammonium, while animals consume these products from plants
-   When organisms die, nitrogen is in an organic form (proteins) and
    must be converted back into inorganic form (ammonification)
-   Nitrogen in the soil is converted back into inert nitrogen gas by
    denitrifying bacteria

[nitrogen cycle]

Phosphorus Cycle

-   Phosphorus is a primary component of DNA and energy-storing
    molecules (ATP), and is present in membranes (phospholipids)
-   Phosphorus-based compounds are usually solid and hence phosphorus is
    not found as a gas in the atmosphere
-   Phosphorus (as phosphates) is incorporated and fixed to soil
    particles but may be released by the weathering of rocks
-   Phosphates may enter the waterways via erosion and leaching

[phosphorus cycle]

Sulphur Cycle

-   Sulphur is an essential component of living organisms, being a
    constituent part of many proteins and enzyme cofactors
-   Sulphur in the air and soil may be oxidised to form sulphates
    (SO₄^(2â€“))
-   Sulphates are reduced by plants and bacteria and hence sulphur
    becomes incorporated into organic molecules
-   Sulphur within the soil can also be mineralised into inorganic forms
    and incorporated with metals (e.g. ironÂ sulphide)
-   Burning of fossil fuels releases sulphur as sulphur dioxide (SO₂),
    which is an enabling component of acid rain

[sulphur cycle]
Carbon Compounds

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide diffuses from the atmosphere or water into
autotrophs

â€¢ Â Autotrophs convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and other
carbon compounds

Â  Â Â 

[carbon organic]

Autotrophs, such as all plants and algae, convert inorganic carbon
dioxide into organic compounds via photosynthesis

-   These organic compounds include the carbohydrates, lipids and
    proteins required by the organism for survival

Since autotrophs use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, the levels of
carbon dioxide within the organism should always be low

-   In other words, carbon dioxide should always be at a higher
    concentration in the atmosphere (or water)
-   This concentration gradient ensures that carbon dioxide will
    passively diffuse into the autotrophic organism as required
-   In aquatic producers, CO₂ can usually diffuse directly into the
    autotroph; whereas in terrestrial plants, diffusion occurs at
    stomata

Heterotrophs cannot synthesise their own organic molecules and instead
obtain carbon compounds via feeding

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is produced by respiration and diffuses out of
organisms into water or the atmosphere

Â  Â Â 

All organisms may produce the chemical energy (ATP) required to power
metabolic processes via the process of cell respiration

-   Cell respiration involves the breakdown of organic molecules (e.g.
    sugars) and produces carbon dioxide as a by-product
-   The build up of CO₂ in respiring tissues creates a concentration
    gradient, allowing it to be removed by passive diffusion

In autotrophs, the uptake of CO₂ by photosynthesis may at times be
balanced by the production of CO₂ by respiration

-   This is known as the compensation point, at which the net carbon
    dioxide assimilation is zero (intake = output)

Similarly, the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment will be
determined by the level of these two processes:

-   If there is more net photosynthesis than cell respiration occuring
    in the biosphere, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels should drop
-   If there is more net respiration than overall photosynthesis
    occuring, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels should increase

Skill:

â€¢ Â Construct a diagram of the carbon cycle

Â  Â Â 
The carbon cycle is a biogeochemical cycle whereby carbon is exchanged
between the different spheres of the Earth

-   The four spheres are the atmosphere (air), lithosphere (ground),
    hydrosphere (water / oceans) and biosphere (living things)

Carbon is exchanged between a variety of forms, including:

-   Atmospheric gases â€“ mainly carbon dioxide (CO₂), but also methane
    (CH₄)
-   Oceanic carbonates â€“ including bicarbonates dissolved in the water
    and calcium carbonate in corals and shells
-   As organic materials â€“ including the carbohydrates, lipids and
    proteins found in all living things
-   As non-living remains â€“ such as detritus and fossil fuels

Different processes facilitate the cycling of carbon between the
different forms (e.g. feeding, combustion, etc.)

Carbon Fluxes

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Estimation of carbon fluxes due to processes in the carbon cycle

Â  Â Â 
Carbon fluxes describe the rate of exchange of carbon between the
various carbon sinks / reservoirs

-   There are four main carbon sinks â€“ lithosphere (earth crust),
    hydrosphere (oceans), atmosphere (air), biosphere (organisms)

The rate at which carbon is exchanged between these reservoirs depends
on the conversion processes involved:

-   Photosynthesis â€“ removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
    fixes it in producers as organic compoundsÂ 
-   Respiration â€“ releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when
    organic compounds are digested in living organisms
-   Decomposition â€“ releases carbon products into the air or sediment
    when organic matter is recycled after death of an organism
-   Gaseous dissolution â€“ the exchange of carbon gases between the
    ocean and atmosphere
-   Lithification â€“ the compaction of carbon-containing sediments into
    fossils and rocks within the Earthâ€™s crust (e.g. limestone)
-   Combustion â€“ releases carbon gases when organic hydrocarbons
    (coal, oil and gas) are burned as a fuel source

It is not possible to directly measure the size of the carbon sinks or
the fluxes between them â€“ instead estimates are made

-   Global carbon fluxes are very large and are therefore measured
    inÂ gigatonnes (1 gigatonne of carbon = 1 billion metric tonnes)
-   Because carbon fluxes are large and based on measurements from many
    different sources, estimates have large uncertaintiesÂ 

Global Carbon Fluxes

[carbon flux]

Estimating carbon fluxes requires an understanding of the factors that
can affect the exchange of carbon between different sinks

-   Some of the main causes for flux change include climate conditions,
    natural events and human activityÂ 

Climate Conditions

-   Rates of photosynthesis will likely by higher in summer seasons, as
    there is more direct sunlight and longer days
-   Oceanic temperatures also determine how much carbon is stored as
    dissolved CO₂ or as hydrogen bicarbonate ions
-   Climate events like El Nino and La Nina will change the rate of
    carbon flux between ocean and atmosphere
-   Melting of polar ice caps will result in the decomposition of frozen
    detritus

Natural Events

-   Forest fires can release high levels of carbon dioxide when plants
    burn (loss of trees also reduces photosynthetic carbon uptake)
-   Volcanic eruptions can release carbon compounds from the Earthâ€™s
    crust into the atmosphere

Human Activity

-   Clearing of trees for agricultural purposes (deforestation) will
    reduce the removal of atmospheric CO₂ via photosynthesis
-   Increased numbers of ruminant livestock (e.g. cows) will produce
    higher levels of methane
-   The burning of fossil fuels will release carbon dioxide into the
    atmosphere

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data from air monitoring stations to explain annual
fluctuations

Â  Â Â 
Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations have been measured at the Mauna Loa
Observatory (in Hawaii) since 1958 by Charles Keeling

From these continuous and regular measurements a clear pattern of carbon
flux can be seen:

-   CO₂ levels fluctuate annually (lower in the summer months when long
    days and more light increase photosynthetic rates)
-   Global CO₂ trends will conform to northern hemisphere patterns as it
    contains more of the planetâ€™s land mass (i.e. more trees)
-   CO₂ levels are steadily increasing year on year since the industrial
    revolution (due to increased burning of fossil fuels)
-   Atmospheric CO₂ levels are currently at the highest levels recorded
    since measurements began

Changes in Carbon Dioxide Levels (Keeling Curve)

[keeling curve]

Data is now being regularly collected at a variety of field stations
globally, using standardised measurement techniques

-   All stations show a clear upward trend in atmospheric CO₂
    concentrations year on year, with annual fluctuations
-   Different monitoring stations may have slightly different trends due
    to seasonal variations and the distribution of local vegetation

Analysing Carbon Data

Carbon data can be plotted and analysed using the online database at
CDIAC (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre)

-   This website stores data on atmospheric CO₂ levels, which can be
    imported into an Excel spreadsheet in order to graph

How to use the CDIAC database:

-   Access the CDIAC website (click on the link to redirect)
-   Click onÂ â€˜Atmospheric Trace Gases and Aerosolsâ€™
    (underÂ â€˜Data' tab at top of page)
-   SelectÂ â€˜Carbon dioxideâ€™ from the list of greenhouse gases
-   Choose a monitoring station / network (e.g. Scripps Institution of
    Oceanography Network)
-   Download data from a particular site (e.g. South Pole, Antarctica)
-   Paste data of interest into an Excel spreadsheet to produce a
    graphical display (e.g. Jan 2000 â€“ Dec 2007)

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of biomass and
fossilised organic matter

Â  Â Â 

[carbon combustion]

When organic compounds rich in hydrocarbons are heated in the presence
of oxygen, they undergo a combustion reaction

-   This reaction is exergonic (produces energy) and releases carbon
    dioxide and water as by-products
-   The carbon dioxide is typically released into the atmosphere,
    increasing the concentration of the gas in the air

Example: Combustion of Propane Â = Â C₃H₈ + 5 O₂Â Â â†’Â Â 3 CO₂ + 4
H₂O + energy

Complete Combustion of a Hydrocarbon

[combustion]

Combustion Sources

1. Â Fossil Fuels

Organic compounds can become rich in hydrocarbons when compacted
underground for millions of years

-   The heat and pressure over time triggers a chemical transformation
    that results in the compaction of the organic matter
-   The resulting products of this process are fossil fuels (coal, oil
    and natural gas)
-   Because this geological process takes millions of years to occur,
    fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source

2. Â Biomass

An alternative to relying on fuels produced by geological processes is
to manufacture fuels from biological processes

-   Living organisms produce hydrocarbons as part of their total biomass
    (either for use or as a waste product)
-   These hydrocarbons can be extracted and purified to produce an
    alternative fuel source (e.g. bioethanol and biodiesel)
-   Provided new raw materials are provided and waste products are
    removed, this source of energy is renewable

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Peat forms when organic matter is not fully decomposed because of
acidic and / or anaerobic conditions in

Â  Â  waterlogged soils

Â  Â Â 

[carbon fuels]

Partial Decomposition

In many soils, saprotrophic bacteria and fungi will decompose dead
organisms and return nutrients to the soil for cycling

-   This decomposition process requires oxygen (cell respiration is
    required to fuel digestive reactions)

Waterlogged regions may lack oxygenated air spaces within the soil and
thus possessÂ anaerobic conditions

-   Anaerobic respiration by organisms in these regions produces organic
    acids (e.g. acetate), resulting in acidic conditionsÂ 
-   Saprotrophic bacteria and fungi cannot function effectively in
    anaerobic / acidic conditions, preventing decomposition

Coal Formation

Since the organic matter is not fully decomposed in waterlogged soils,
carbon-rich molecules remain in the soil and form peat

-   When deposits of peat are compressed under sediments, the heat and
    pressure force out impurities and remove moisture
-   The remaining material has a high carbon concentration and undergoes
    a chemical transformation to produceÂ coal

How Coal is Formed

[coal formation]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Partially decomposed organic matter from past geological eras was
converted into either coal or into oil and gas

Â  Â  which accumulates in porous rocks

Â  Â Â 

Oil / Natural Gas Formation

Oil (i.e. petroleum) and natural gas form as the result of the decay of
marine organisms on the ocean floor

-   Sediments (e.g. clay and mud) are deposited on top of the organic
    matter, creating anoxic conditions that prevent decomposition
-   As a result of the burial and compaction, the organic material
    becomes heated and hydrocarbons are formed
-   The hydrocarbons form oil and gas, which are forced out of the
    source rock and accumulate in porous rocks (e.g. sandstone)

The formation of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) takes place over
millions of years, making them a non-renewable energy source

Essential Idea:
Continued availability of carbonÂ 
in ecosystems depends on carbon cycling

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Autotrophs convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and other
    carbon compounds
-   In aquatic ecosystems carbon is present as dissolved carbon dioxide
    and hydrogen carbonate ions
-   Carbon dioxide diffuses from the atmosphere or water into autotrophs
-   Carbon dioxide is produced by respiration and diffuses out of
    organisms into water or the atmosphere
-   Methane is produced from organic matter in anaerobic conditions by
    methanogenic archaeans and some diffuses into the atmosphere or
    accumulates in the ground
-   Methane is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere
-   Peat forms when organic matter is not fully decomposed because of
    acidic and/or anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils
-   Partially decomposed organic matter from past geological eras was
    converted into either coal or into oil and gas that accumulates in
    porous rocks
-   Carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of biomass and
    fossilised organic matter
-   Animals such as reef-building corals and mollusca haveÂ hard parts
    that are composed of calcium carbonate and can become fossilised in
    limestone

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Methane is produced from organic matter in anaerobic conditions by
methanogenic archaeans and some

Â  Â  diffuses into the atmosphere or accumulates in the ground

Â  Â Â 

[carbon methane]

Methanogens are archaean microorganisms that produce methane (CH₄) as a
metabolic by-product in anaerobicÂ conditions

Anaerobic conditions where methanogens may be found include:

-   Wetlands (e.g. swamps and marshes)
-   Marine sediments (e.g. in the mud of lake beds)
-   Digestive tract of ruminant animals (e.g. cows, sheep, goats)

Methanogens produce methane from the by-products of anaerobic digestion,
principallyÂ acetic acid andÂ carbon dioxide:

-   Acetic acidÂ â†’Â Methane and Carbon Dioxide Â (CH₃COO^(â€“) + H⁺
    Â â†’Â  CH₄ + CO₂)
-   Carbon Dioxide and HydrogenÂ â†’Â Methane and Water Â (CO₂ + 4 H₂
    Â â†’Â Â CH₄ + 2 H₂O)

Methane may either accumulate under the ground or diffuse into the
atmosphere

-   When organic matter is buried in anoxic conditions (e.g. sea beds),
    deposits of methane (natural gas) may form underground
-   Rising global numbers of domesticated cattle may be increasing the
    levels of methane being released into the atmosphere

Stages of Methane Production in a Ruminant

[methane production]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Methane is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere

Â  Â Â 

When methane is released into the atmosphere as a result of anaerobic
reactions, it only persists for ~12 years

Methane will be naturally oxidised to form carbon dioxide and water
Â (CH₄ + 2 O₂ Â â†’Â Â CO₂ + 2 H₂O)

-   This is why methane levels in the atmosphere are not very large,
    even though significant quantities are being produced Â 

Oxidation of Atmospheric Methane

[methane oxidation]
Ocean Acidification

The ocean is the largest active carbon sink on Earth, responsible for
absorbing roughly a third of all human-produced CO₂

-   Some CO₂ may remain as dissolved gas within the water, however the
    majority will combine with water to form carbonic acid
-   The solubility of CO₂Â in sea water is inversely proportional to
    oceanic temperature (i.e. more soluble in cooler temperatures)
-   It is therefore a concern that global warming could limit carbon
    storage in oceans, exacerbating climate change

Ocean-Atmosphere Exchange

-   Typically, when carbon dioxide is dissolved in the ocean, it
    combines with water molecules to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃)
-   The carbonic acid then dissociates to form bicarbonate ions
    (HCO₃^(â€“)) and hydrogen ions (H⁺)
-   The ocean also contains carbonate ions (CO₃^(â€“)), which are
    absorbed by coral and molluscs to form calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)
-   Calcium carbonate is used to form the hard exoskeletons of
    reef-building corals and is used by molluscs to develop shells
-   H⁺ ions can reduce the stock of carbonate ions in the ocean by
    combining with it to form bicarbonate
-   Hence, the levels of H⁺ ions must be kept low to ensure that their
    is sufficient stock of carbonate ions for aquatic organisms

[acidification before]

Ocean Acidification

-   As a result of deforestation and the increased burning of fossil
    fuels, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased
-   With more CO₂ being absorbed by the oceans, there is an associated
    increase in the production of H⁺ ions
-   These H⁺ ions lower the pH of the ocean, causing acidification
    (ocean pH has dropped ~0.2 since the industrial revolution)
-   The H⁺ ions will also combine with carbonate ions, reducing
    theÂ amounts available to marine organisms
-   This will result in the formation of thinner, deformed shells and
    reduce the population numbers of reef-building corals
-   The reduction in pH will also dissolve calcium carbonate structures,
    enhancing the damage to shells and corals

Carbon Footprint

A carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse gases
produced to directly and indirectly support human activity

-   It is usually expressed in equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂)

A carbon footprint is therefore the sum of all CO₂ emissions that were
induced by a person's activity within a given timeframe:

-   All fossil fuelÂ consumption (including petrol, electricity, natural
    gas)
-   All transportation (besides human-powered activities like walking
    and cycling)
-   All emissions associated with consumables (e.g. the production of a
    cheesburger can result in ~ 3 kg of CO₂ emissions)

Efforts to reduce a carbon footprint of an individual, household or
company usually involves reducing, reusing and recycling

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Global temperatures and climate patterns are influenced by
concentration of greenhouse gases

Â  Â Â 
Greenhouse gases play a pivotal role in determining global temperatures
and climate patterns due to their capacity to retain heat

-   As these gases trap heat, increases in greenhouse gas concentrations
    should correlate with an increase in global temperatureÂ 
-   Long term weather patterns (climate) may also be influenced by
    greenhouse gas concentrations

Scientists predict that increases in greenhouse gas concentrations will
lead to an enhanced greenhouse effect, resulting in:

-   More frequent extreme weather conditions (e.g. heat waves, cyclones,
    more powerful tropical storms, etc.)
-   Some areas to become more drought affected, while other areas become
    more prone to periods of heavy rainfall
-   Changes to circulating ocean currents â€“ which may cause longer El
    Nino (warming) and La Nina (cooling) events

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Correlations between global temperatures and carbon dioxide
concentrations on Earth

Â  Â Â 
The link between global temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations
was established by analysing data over a long time period

-   Ice cores taken from the Vostok station in Antarctica provide
    evidence of the environmental conditions at the time of freezing
-   The Vostok ice core is one of the longest drilled, reaching back
    420,000 years and covering the past four glacial cycles
-   By analysing the gas bubbles trapped in ice, historical CO₂ levels
    and air temperatures (via oxygen isotopes) can be deduced

Data collected from the Vostok ice core demonstrates that:

-   There is a strong positive correlation between carbon dioxide
    concentrations and temperature (â†‘ CO₂ levelsÂ âˆ?Â â†‘
    temperature)
-   There have been fluctuating cycles of CO₂ concentrations which
    appear to correlate with global warm ages and ice ages
-   Current concentrations of CO₂ are higher than at any time recorded
    in the last 400,000 years

Vostok Ice Core Data â€“ Temperature versus Carbon Dioxide Concentration

[vostok data]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â There is a correlation between rising atmospheric concentrations
of carbon dioxide since the start of theÂ 

Â  Â Â industrial revolution 200 years ago and average global
temperatures

Â  Â Â 
The industrial revolution introduced new manufacturing processes which
significantly increased mankindâ€™s use of fossil fuels

-   The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide as a by-product,
    leading to a steadyÂ increase in itsÂ atmospheric concentration

When fuel emissions, atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and global
temperatures are compared, the following trends are revealed:

-   There is a strong positive correlation between increasing fossil
    fuel emissions and rising atmospheric concentrations of CO₂
-   Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations have increased ~38% since
    pre-industrial times (1800: ~ 280 ppm ; 2010: ~ 380 ppm)
-   About 40% of CO₂ emissions have remained in the atmosphere, the rest
    has been absorbed by carbon sinks (mainly oceans)
-   This increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration correlates
    with an increase in average global temperature
-   While correlation does not equal causation, there is mounting
    evidence to suggest that CO₂ emissions are linked to global
    temperature changes (although other factors likely also contribute)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recent increases in atmospheric CO₂ are largely due to increases
in the combustion of fossilised organic matter

Â  Â Â 
While greenhouse gases occur naturally, man is increasing greenhouse gas
emission via a number of activities, including:

-   Deforestation â€“ the removal of trees means that less carbon
    dioxide is removed from the atmosphere via photosynthesis
-   Increased farming / agriculture â€“ this involves land clearing for
    cattle grazing, also ruminant cattle produce methaneÂ 

The greenhouse gas that is increasing most rapidly in the atmosphere is
carbon dioxide and the main cause is combustion

-   When fossil fuels (e.g. coal, oil, gas) are combusted to release
    energy, carbon dioxide gas is released as a by-product
-   The increased reliance on fossil fuels following the industrial
    revolution has resulted in ~38% increase in CO₂ levels
-   There are now efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by
    exploiting alternative energy sources (e.g. solar power)

Application:

â€¢ Â Evaluating claims that human activities are not causing climate
change

Â  Â Â 
Many claims have been made regarding the impact of human activities on
climate change â€“ not all are supported by evidence

-   Many arguments are not backed by reliable scientific data or are
    made by entities with vested interests (e.g. oil companies)

Below are some of the main claims raised by sceptics of human-induced
climate change and the common counter-arguments:

Examples of Data Used to Make Climate Change Claims

[]
Â Â  Data: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Figure 1
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Figure 2 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â  Figure 3 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Figure 4

Claim 1: Â Climate has changed in the past and current trends merely
reflect the Earthâ€™s natural climatic cycle

-   Data collected from the Vostok ice core shows several changes in
    climate over the last 400,000 years (Figure 1)
-   At several points in history, global average temperatures have been
    warmer than those currently observed

Counter Argument: Â 

-   Climate changes do occur naturally, but usually not as abruptly as
    what is seen currently
-   When global warming occurred abruptly in the past, it was always
    highly destructive to life (e.g. Permian mass extinction)
-   Atmospheric CO₂ levels positively correlate to average global
    temperatures and are currently at the highest levels ever recorded

Claim 2: Â Climate change is being caused by solar activity and the
effect of greenhouse gas emissions is negligible

-   Temperatures on Earth are influenced by the amount of solar
    radiation from the sun (more radiation = warmer temperatures)
-   Warmer temperatures may be caused by an increase in solar irradiance
    by the sun (as determined by the number of sunspots)Â 

Counter Argument:

-   Over the last 35 years the sun has shown a slight cooling trend,
    however average global temperatures have increased (Figure 2)
-   There is no evidence to support a correlation between solar
    irradiance and current global temperature trends

Claim 3: Â Certain changes in climate conditions cannot be linked to
greenhouse gas emissions

-   Global sea levels began to increase before greenhouse gas emissions
    significantly increased following the industrial revolution
-   Therefore climate changes like rising sea levels are unrelated to
    greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 3)

Counter Argument:

-   The overall pattern of change in sea levels will be influenced by
    the period of time over which the data is collected
-   While sea levels did increase preceding the industrial revolution,
    this rise in sea levels followed a preceding period of decrease
-   The rate at which sea levels have risen in the past 30 years is
    greater than that seen in the last 200 years

Claim 4: Â Variability between predicted climate change models means
that such models are unreliable

-   Three different models of predicted climate change commissioned by
    the IPCC show variation of more than 5ÂºC (Figure 4)
-   Climate change models are based on assumptions and if those
    assumptions are false, the predictions will be incorrect

Counter Argument:

-   The assumptions made by the different models relate to the extent of
    human activity predicted over the next 100 years
-   Model A1B predicts a continued reliance on fossil fuels while model
    B1 predicts a reduction in the current use of raw materials
-   All three models still predict an increase in average global
    temperatures over the next 100 years

Claim 5: Â Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
will not be enough to cause significant climate change

-   As of 2009, there were only ~39 molecules of carbon dioxide per
    100,000 molecules in the atmosphere
-   At our current rate of CO₂ emission, it will take mankind another 5
    years to raise that level by 1 molecule (to 40 per 100,000)
-   While we may double atmospheric CO₂ levels by the end of the
    century, doublingÂ a small number still produces a small number

Counter Argument:

-   The reason why carbon dioxide is so important to the environment is
    because there is so little of it
-   Living things require constant internal environments (homeostasis)
    â€“ small external changes can have big impacts on viability

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The warmed Earth emits longer wavelength radiation (heat)

â€¢ Â Longer wave radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases that retain
the heat in the atmosphere

Â  Â Â 
The greenhouse effect is a natural process whereby the atmosphere
behaves like a greenhouse to trap and retain heat

-   This ensures the Earth maintains the moderate temperatures needed by
    organisms to maintain life processes (homeostasis)
-   Without a greenhouse effect, Earthâ€™s temperatures would drop
    significantly at night in the absence of direct sunlight

How the Greenhouse Effect Works

The greenhouse effect functions to trap heat within the atmosphere and
hence prevent rapid temperature fluctuations

-   Incoming radiation from the sun is shorter wave radiation
    (ultraviolet radiation and the visible spectrum)
-   The surface of the Earth absorbs short wave radiation and re-emits
    it at a longer wavelength (i.e. infra-red / heat)
-   Greenhouse gases absorb and re-radiate this longer wave radiation
    and hence retain the heat within the atmosphere

Greenhouse Gases

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide and water vapour are the most significant
greenhouse gases

â€¢ Â Other gases including methane and nitrogen oxides have less impact

Â  Â Â 
Greenhouse gases absorb and emit long-wave (infrared) radiation, thereby
trapping and holding heat within the atmosphere

-   Greenhouse gases collectively make up less than 1% of the Earthâ€™s
    atmosphere

The greenhouse gases which have the largest warming effect within the
atmosphere are water vapour (clouds) and carbon dioxide

-   Water vapour is created via evaporation of water bodies (e.g.
    oceans) and transpiration â€“ it is removed via precipitation (rain)
-   Carbon dioxide is made by cell respiration and burning fossil fuels
    â€“ it is removed via photosynthesis and absorption by oceans

Other greenhouse gases include methane and nitrogen oxides â€“ these
have less impact on the overall warming effect

-   Methane is emitted from waterlogged habitats (like marshes) and
    landfills â€“ it is also a gaseous waste produced by ruminants
-   Nitrogen oxides are released naturally by certain bacteria and also
    is emitted in the exhaust by certain vehicles

Water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, but
is not produced as a product of human activity

Proportion of Greenhouse Gases (Natural vs Anthropomorphic)

[greenhouse gas chart]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The impact of a gas depends on its ability to absorb long-wave
radiation as well as its concentration within

Â  Â Â the atmosphere

Â  Â Â 
There are two factors which determine how much of an the impact a
greenhouse gas will have in warming the atmosphere:

1. Â Ability to absorb long-wave radiation

-   Gases that have a greater capacity to absorb long-wave radiation
    will have a greater warming impact (per molecule)

2. Â Concentration within the atmosphere

-   The greater the concentration of a gas, the greater its warming
    impact will be within the atmosphere
-   The concentration of a gas will be determined by both its rate of
    release and persistence within the atmosphere

The overall impact of a greenhouse gas will be determined by the
combination of both these factors

-   Methane has a larger capacity to absorb long-wave radiation than
    carbon dioxide, but is significantly less abundant
-   Water vapour enters the atmosphere rapidly but only remains for
    short periods, while carbon dioxide persists for years
-   Human activity is increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (except
    water vapour) and hence increasing their impact

Summary of Greenhouse Gas Impacts

[greenhouse gases]
Greenhouse Impacts

There are many proposed environmental consequences associated with an
enhanced greenhouse effect, including:

-   Disease spread â€“ More temperate climates will increase the
    prevalence and spread of pathogenic vectors (e.g. mosquitos)
-   Ice caps melting â€“ Higher temperatures are melting ice caps and
    reducing permafrosts, releasing detritus trapped in ice
-   Extreme weather conditions â€“ Climate change is linked to an
    increase in extreme weather (e.g. cyclones, tropical storms)

-   Extinction â€“ Changing climate will increase competition, leading
    to a loss of biodiversity and extinction eventsÂ 
-   Acidification of oceans â€“ Rising atmospheric CO₂ levels contribute
    to an increase in the acidification of oceans
-   Rising sea levels â€“ Global warming is associated with rising sea
    levels, leading to the displacement of communities
-   Temperature increases â€“ Greenhouse gas emissions are linked to an
    increase in average global temperatures
-   Habitat destruction â€“ Changing climate conditions will lead to the
    destruction of habitats and expansion of temperate species

-   Other gases including methane and nitrogen oxides have less impact
-   The impact of a gas depends on its ability to absorb long wave

-   There is a correlation between rising atmospheric concentrations of

Application:

â€¢ Â Threats to coral reefs from increasing concentrations of dissolved
carbon dioxide

Â  Â Â 
The oceans are a major carbon sink and absorb roughly a third of all
human produced (anthropomorphic) CO₂ emissions

-   CO₂ solubility is temperature dependent (more soluble when cooler),
    so less CO₂ will be absorbed as temperatures rise

When oceans absorb atmospheric CO₂, some of it will remain dissolved in
a gaseous state but most will be chemically modified:

-   Carbon dioxide will combine with water to form carbonic acid, which
    dissociates into hydrogen ions and hydrogen carbonate
-   H⁺ ions will lower the ocean pH (acidification) and will also
    combine with free carbonate ions to form more hydrogen carbonate
-   With less free carbonate ions in the water, marine organisms are
    less able to produce calcium carbonate (via calcification)
-   Calcium carbonate is used to form the hard exoskeleton of coral and
    is also present in the shells of certain molluscs
-   Hence increasing concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide
    threatens the viability of coral reefs and certain molluscs

CO₂ Emissions and Ocean Acidification

Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are causing a decrease in
the pH of ocean water (ocean acidification)

-   Since the start of the industrial revolution ocean pH has dropped
    from ~8.2 to ~8.1 (roughly a 30% increase in acidity)Â 
-   It is predicted that if current conditions continue, oceanic pH
    could fall to roughly 7.8 by the turn of the century (2100)

The decrease in ocean pH is predicted to threaten the survival of marine
organisms that require calcium carbonate

-   An increase in the concentration of H⁺ ions means there are less
    free carbonate ions available for calcification
-   Shells and coral exoskeletons are also likely to begin to dissolve
    when ocean conditions are more acidic
-   Experiments have shown that increasing water acidity correlates with
    the significant thinning of shells over several weeks
-   Corals, sea urchins and shelled molluscs do not exist in regions
    with high levels of dissolved CO₂ (e.g. near hydrothermal vents)

Consequences of Ocean Acidification

An increase in ocean acidification as a result of elevated
anthropomorphic CO₂ emissions could have several consequences:

-   The disappearance of coral reefs could result in a loss of shoreline
    protection and habitat, altering coastal ecosystems
-   The loss in revenue from tourism and food industries is predicted to
    cost economies upwards of $1 trillion by 2100
-   Increasing the dissolved CO₂ levels in oceans would cause invasive
    species of algae to flourish (more photosynthesis)

Precautionary Principle

The precautionary principle states that when a human-induced activity
raises a significant threat of harm to the environment or human health,
then precautionary measures should be taken even if there is no
scientific consensus regarding cause and effect
It is argued that the enhanced greenhouse effect requires precautionary
measures because:

-   The global climate is a complex phenomena with many emergent
    properties that are difficult to predict or control
-   Climatic changes are based on time frames well beyond human
    lifespans, making it difficult to gather scientific evidenceÂ 
-   If global warming continues to escalate unchecked, the consequences
    to mankind as a species are potentially life threateningÂ 

According to the precautionary principle, the onus for action falls on
those contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect

-   This makes action on climate change a global issue â€“ involving
    governments, industries, communities and the individual

The precautionary principle is effectively the reverse of theÂ â€˜burden
of proofâ€™, which advocates inaction until cause is proven

Precautionary Principle versus Burden of Proof

[precautionary principle]

Action on Climate Change

Arguments For:

-   Risks of inaction are potentially severe (e.g. more droughts,
    floods, rising sea levels)
-   Higher temperatures will increase the spread of vector-borne
    diseases
-   Loss of habitat will result in the extinction of some species (loss
    of biodiversity)
-   Climate changes may affect food production, resulting in famines
-   Climate changes could destroy certain industries which countries
    rely on (e.g. fishing), leading to poverty
-   These factors would increase economic burdens and competition for
    resources, creating international tensions

Arguments Against:

-   Cutting greenhouse emissions may delay economic growth in developing
    countries, increasing poverty
-   It is difficult to achieve globalÂ consensus on action and even
    harder to police
-   No guarantee that human intervention will be sufficient to alter
    global climate patterns
-   Restrictions imposed by carbon reduction schemes may prevent the
    development of beneficial future technologies
-   Carbon reduction schemes will likely result in significant job
    losses from key industries, requiring retraining of unemployed
    workers
Water Cycle

The water (hydrologic) cycle describes the continuous movement of water
on, above and below the surface of the Earth

This movement of water involves several different processes, including:

-   EvaporationÂ â€“ Water is converted to vapour by the sun and
    transferred from the Earthâ€™s surface to the atmosphere
-   TranspirationÂ â€“ Water vapour is released by plants and soil into
    the atmosphere
-   CondensationÂ â€“ Water vapour is transformed into liquid water
    droplets in the air (creating clouds and fog)
-   PrecipitationÂ â€“ Water vapour in the atmosphere condenses into
    liquid (rain) or solid (snow) and returns to the Earth
-   InfiltrationÂ â€“ The flow of water from the ground surface into the
    soil
-   RunoffÂ â€“ The variety of ways water moves along the ground
-   Subsurface FlowÂ â€“ The flow of water underground (will eventually
    drain into oceans or return to the surface via springs)

â€¢ Â Evolution of homologous structures by adaptive radiation explains
similarities in structure when there areÂ 

Â  Â  differences in function

Â  Â Â 
Comparative anatomy of groups of organisms may show certain structural
features that are similar, implying common ancestry

-   Anatomical features that are similar in basic structure despite
    being used in different ways are called homologous structures
-   The more similar the homologous structures between two species are,
    the more closely related they are likely to be

Homologous structures illustrate adaptive radiation, whereby several new
species rapidly diversify from an ancestral source, with each new
species adapted to utilise a specific unoccupied nicheÂ

-   Mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles all share a similar
    arrangement of bones in their appendages based on a five-digit
    limbÂ 

Despite possessing similar bone arrangements, animal limbs may be highly
dissimilar according to the mode of locomotion:

-   Human hands are adapted for tool manipulation (power vs precision
    grip)
-   Bird and bat wings are adapted for flying
-   Horse hooves are adapted for galloping
-   Whale and dolphin fins are adapted for swimming

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Development of melanistic insects in polluted areas

Â  Â Â 
Peppered moths (Biston betularia) exist in two distinct polymorphic
forms â€“ a light colouration and a darker melanic variant

-   In an unpolluted environment, the trees are covered by a
    pale-coloured lichen, which provides camouflage for the lighter moth
-   In a polluted environment, sulphur dioxide kills the lichen while
    soot blackens the bark, providing camouflage for the dark moth

Peppered Moth Variants (Light vs Dark Colouration)

[peppered moth]

The frequency of the two different forms of peppered moth is dependent
on the environment and evolves as conditions change

-   Before the industrial revolution, the environment was largely
    unpolluted and the lighter moth had a survival advantage
-   Following the industrial revolution, the environment became heavily
    polluted, conferring a survival advantage to the darker moth
-   Recent environmental policies in Europe are reducing pollution
    levels, altering the frequency of the two populations once again

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evolution occurs when heritable characteristics of a species
change

Â  Â Â 
Evolution at its most fundamental level simply describes a change over
time

-   In living organisms this change refers to the heritable
    characteristics of a species (biological evolution)

Heritable characteristics are encoded for by genes and may be
transferred between generations as allelesÂ 

-   Hence biological evolution describes cumulative changes that occur
    within aÂ populationÂ between one generation and the next

A concise definition for biological evolution is:

-   A change in the allele frequency of a populationâ€™s gene pool over
    successive generations

Evolution = Change Over Time

[change over time]
Fossilisation

Fossilisation is a rare process, the vast majority of deceased organisms
disappear without leaving a trace

In order forÂ fossilisation to occur, the following conditions are
required:

-   Hard body parts (bones, teeth, shells) â€“ soft body parts will not
    fossilise, but may leave behind trace evidence (e.g. imprints)
-   Preservation of remains (protection against scavenging, erosion and
    environmental damage)
-   High pressure to promote mineralisation of remains (i.e. turn hard
    body parts into fossilised rocks)
-   Anoxic (low oxygen) conditions to protect against oxygen damage and
    prevent decomposition by saprotrophs

The stages of fossilisation generally occur as follows:

1. Â Death and decay â€“ Soft body parts are decomposed or scavenged,
leaving only the hard body remains

2. Â Deposition â€“ The hard remains are rapidly covered with silt and
sand, and over time more layers continue to build

3. Â Permineralisation â€“ Pressure from the covering layers of
dirt/rock cause the hard organic material to be replaced by minerals

4. Â Erosion / exposure â€“ Movement of earth plates may displace the
fossil and return it to the surface for discovery

Fossil Record

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The fossil record provides evidence for evolution

Â  Â Â 
Something provides evidence for evolution when it demonstrates a change
in characteristics from an ancestral form

-   The fossil record provides evidence by revealing the features of an
    ancestor for comparison against livingÂ descendantsÂ 

Fossils

A fossil is the preserved remains or traces of any organism from the
remote past

-   Preserved remains (body fossils) provide direct evidence of
    ancestral forms and include bones, teeth, shells, leaves, etc.
-   Traces provide indirect evidence of ancestral forms and include
    footprints, tooth marks, burrows and faeces (coprolite)

The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, is referred
to as the fossil record

-   The fossil record shows that over time changes have occurred in the
    features of living organisms (evolution)

Law of Fossil Succession

Fossils can be dated by determining the age of the rock layer (strata)
in which the fossil is found

-   Sedimentary rock layers develop in a chronological order, such that
    lower layers are older and newer strata form on top
-   Each strata represents a variable length of time that is classified
    according to a geological time scale (eons, eras, periods)

Different kinds of organisms are found in rocks of particular ages in a
consistent order, indicating a sequence of development

-   Prokaryotes appear in the fossil record before eukaryotes
-   Ferns appear in the fossil record before flowering plants
-   Invertebrates appear in the fossil record before vertebrate species

This chronological sequence of complexity by which characteristics
appear to develop is known as the law of fossil succession

-   This ordered succession of fossils suggests that newer species
    likely evolved as a result of changes to ancestral species

The Law of Fossil Succession

Transitional Fossils

While fossils may provide clues as to evolutionary relationships, it is
important to realise that the fossil record is incomplete

-   Fossilisation requires an unusual set of specific circumstances in
    order to occur, meaning very few organisms become fossils
-   Only the hard parts of an organism are typically preserved, meaning
    usually only fragments of remains are discovered
-   With limited fossil data, it can be difficult to discern the
    evolutionary patterns that result from ancestral forms (â€˜missing
    linksâ€™)

Transitional fossils demonstrate the intermediary forms that occurred
over the evolutionary pathway taken by a single genus

-   They establish the links between species by exhibiting traits common
    to both an ancestor and its predicted descendents
-   An example of a transitional fossil is archaeopteryx, which links
    the evolution of dinosaurs (jaws, claws) to birds (feathers)
-   As new fossils are discovered, new evolutionary patterns are
    emerging and old assumptions are challenged

Transitional Fossil â€“ Archaeopteryx

[transitional fossil]

Fossil Evidence

An example of how fossils provide evidence of evolution can be
established by comparingÂ hominin skeletons

-   Australopithecus is an early hominin ancestor that first appears in
    the fossil record approximately 4 million years ago
-   Comparing these fossils to the bone structure of modern man (Homo
    sapiens) demonstrates key evolutionary changes

These evolutionary trends (from Australopithecus to Homo sapiens)
include:

Geological Time Scale

The Earth formed ~4.6 billion years ago and the earliest forms of life
are thought to have appeared ~3.5 billion years ago

-   To describe the geology and history of life on Earth, scientists
    have developed the geological time scale

The geological time scale measures time on a scale involving four units:

-   An epoch is the smallest unit of time on the scale, but still
    encompasses a period of millions of years
-   Chronologically, epochs are grouped together into larger units
    called periods
-   Periods are combined to make a subdivision called an era
-   An eon is the largest division of geological time

The division of time units in the scale is typically based on the
occurrence of a significant geological event (e.g. mass extinction)

-   Consequently, geological time categories are variable in length and
    do not usually consist of a uniform length of time

5.1 Â Evidence for Evolution

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
There is overwhelming evidence
for the evolution of life on earth

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Evolution occurs when heritable characteristics of a species change
-   The fossil record provides evidence for evolution
-   Selective breeding of domesticated animals shows that artificial
    selection can cause evolution
-   Evolution of homologous structures by adaptive radiation explains
    similarities inÂ structure when there are differences in function
-   Populations of a species can gradually diverge into separate species
    by evolution
-   Continuous variation across the geographical range of related
    populations matches the concept of gradual divergence

Applications:

-   Development of melanistic insects in polluted areas
-   Comparison of the pentadactyl limb of mammals, birds, amphibians and
    reptiles with different methods of locomotion
Other Evidence

There are numerous examples within nature which support the theory of
evolution by demonstrating change over time

-   The fossil record, selective breeding and comparative anatomy are
    three of the most widely recognised pieces of evidence
-   Biogeography, vestigial structures and comparative embryology
    provide further evidence for evolution
-   Additionally, molecular evidence (e.g. gene sequencing) is now being
    used to demonstrate evolutionary relationships

Vestigial Structures

Some species show the presence of functionless and reduced remnants of
organs that were once present in their ancestors

-   Changes to the environment have rendered these organs redundant and
    so over time they have lost their functionality

These structures are called vestigial organs and demonstrate the
evolutionary divergence of a species from a past activity

-   An example of a vestigial organ is the pelvic bone in whales â€“
    this bone suggests that whale ancestors were terrestrial mammals

Example of a Vestigial Structure

[vestigial structure]

Biogeography

Biogeography describes the distribution of lifeforms over geographical
areas, both in past and present times

-   Related species are usually found in close physical proximity
    (supporting the concept of speciation via gradual divergence)
-   Fossils found in a particular region tend to closely resemble the
    modern organisms of the region

Biogeography provides evidence for evolution because it suggests that
closely distributed species share a common lineage

-   If speciation was random, the distribution of structurally similar
    species would be expected to be scatteredÂ 

Examples of biogeographical distribution indicating shared ancestry can
be observed by the fact that:

-   Most modern marsupials are found almost exclusively in Australia
    (~70% of extant species)
-   Australia has few placental mammals compared to South America, even
    though environmental conditions are similar

Exceptions to this correlation between biogeographical distribution and
common ancestry can be explained by continental drift

-   Over 250 million years ago, there was a single continental landmass
    (Pangaea) which split into the 6 current land regions
-   Closely related species that were separated by the breaking landmass
    are localised to regions that were once connected
    -   For example, ratites (flightless birds) are distributed globally
        according to regions that were once part of Gondwanaland

Biogeographical Distribution of Ratites as Explained by Continental
Drift

[biogeography]

Comparative Embryology

Studying the growing embryo in animals or plants shows that closely
related species go through similar stages of development

-   These similarities in embryonic development suggest that the
    organisms shared a common evolutionary pathway

Comparing the embryonic development of a range of diverse animal
species, it can be seen that:

-   All terrestrial animals have non-functioning gill slits (pharyngeal
    slits) as early embryos (suggesting an aquaticÂ origin)
-   Many vertebrates (including humans) demonstrate a primitive tail at
    an early stage of embryonic development

Radioactive Dating

One of the most commonly used methods for determining the age of fossils
is via radioactive dating (a.k.a. absolute dating)

-   This method involves comparing the ratio of radioactive isotopes in
    the fossil to that found in the atmosphere today

Radioisotopes are alternative forms of an element that have the same
number of protons but a different number of neutrons

-   These isotopes are unstable and decay at a constant rate to form a
    more stable daughter isotope

There are three types of radioactive decay that can occur (depending on
the radioisotope involved):

-   Alpha decay â€“ Atom releases two protons and two neutrons (alpha
    particle) to form a new, more stable element
-   Beta decay â€“ A neutron decays to produce a proton, electron and
    anti-neutrino (electron is released and a new element forms)
-   Gamma decay â€“ Involves the release of electromagnetic radiation
    (gamma rays), but does not change the mass of the atom

Alpha radiation can be stopped by paper, beta radiation can be stopped
by wood, while gamma radiation is stopped by lead

Types of Radioactive Decay

[radioisotopes]

Half Life

Radioisotopes decay at a constant rate and the time taken for half the
original radioisotope to decay is known as the half life

-   Different radioisotopes have different half lives and are thus
    useful for dating different types of fossilised remains

Short Range Dating

-   All living things contain carbon and this carbon exists as a mix of
    two isotopes â€“ ¹²C (stable) and ¹⁴C (radioactive)
-   While alive, the proportion of the two isotopes will mirror
    environmental levels (as carbon is constantly being cycled)
-   When an organism dies, the ratio no longer remains fixed but changes
    as ¹⁴C breaks down into ¹⁴N (beta decay)
-   Scientists can measure the amount of ¹⁴C remaining in a sample to
    determine how long ago it died
-   ¹⁴C has a half life of only 5,730 years and so can only effectively
    date samples less than ~60,000 years old

Long Range Dating

-   Longer range dating can be accomplished by dating the rocks around
    the fossil to determine an age range (relative dating)
-   Dating can only be undertaken on igneous rock, not the fossils
    themselves or the sedimentary rock in which they are found
-   ⁴⁰K is released in lava from active volcanos and decays into ⁴⁰Ar
    with a half life of approximately 1.3 billion years
-   Using the volcanic eruption as an indicator of when a rock layer
    (strata) developed, the age of the fossil can be approximated
-   As ⁴⁰Ar is inert and would have been released as a gas during the
    eruption, its levels in the rock indicate radioactive decay

While radioisotope dating is the most commonly used method for dating
fossils, other techniques do exist

-   These other techniques include relative dating via index fossils and
    electron spin resonance (ESR)

-   The earth is arranged into sedimentary layers (stratification) with
    older stratum at the bottom and newer layers on top
-   Different regions will not always have the same sedimentary layers
    due to environmental conditions (erosion, flooding, etc.)
-   Index fossils represent short-lived species and thus can only be
    found in a restricted depth of rock strata
-   Index fossils can be used to synchronise the ages of rock layers
    when other dating techniques are not available

Electron Spin Resonance

-   Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a useful dating tool for organic
    samples that are aged between 50,000 â€“ 500,000 years old
-   ESR depends on the fact that when objects are buried they are
    bombarded by natural radiation from the soil
-   This causes the electrons in minerals to move to (and remain in) a
    higher energy state
-   The number of high energy electrons in a sample can be used to
    determine when the sample was buried

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Selective breeding of domesticated animals shows that artificial
selection can cause evolution

Â  Â Â 
Selective breeding is a form of artificial selection, whereby man
intervenes in the breeding of species to produce desired traits in
offspring

-   By breeding members of a species with a desired trait, the traitâ€™s
    frequency becomes more common in successive generations
-   Selective breeding provides evidence of evolution as targeted breeds
    can show significant variation in a (relatively) short period

Selective breeding of plant crops has allowed for the generation of new
types of foods from the same ancestral plant source

-   Plants of the genusÂ Brassica have been bred to produce different
    foods by modifying plant sections through artificial selection
-   This includes broccoli (modified flower buds), cabbage (modified
    leaf buds) and kale (modified leaves)

Selective breeding of domesticated animals has also resulted in the
generation of diverse breeds of offspring

-   Examples of selective breeding of domesticated animals can be seen
    in horse, cows and dogs

Example 1: Â Horse Breeding

Horses have been selectively bred across many generations to produce
variation according to a targeted function

-   Race horses have been bred for speed and hence are typically leaner,
    lighter, taller and quicker
-   Draft horses have been bred for power and endurance and hence are
    sturdier and stockier

Example 2: Â Cow Breeding

Cows have been selectively bred across many generations to produce
offspring with improved milk production

Farmers have also targeted the breeding a cows with a mutation resulting
in increased muscle mass

-   The resulting stock of cattle (termed Belgian Blue) have excessive
    bulk and produce more edible lean meat

[belgian blue]

Example 3: Â Dog Breeding

Dog breeds show an enormous amount of variety due to the targeted
selection of particular traits by man

-   Hunting dogs (e.g. beagles) were typically bred to be smaller in
    stature so as to enter fox holes
-   Herding dogs (e.g. sheep dogs) were bred for heightened intelligence
    in order to follow herding commands
-   Racing dogs (e.g. greyhounds) were specifically bred to be sleek and
    fastÂ 
-   Toy dogs (e.g. chihuahuas) were selectively bred for their
    dimunitive size

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Continuous variation across a geographical range of related
populations matches the concept of gradual divergence

Â  Â Â 
Within a population of any given species there will be genetic variation
(i.e. variation which is inheritable)

-   Typically this variation will be continuous and follow a normal
    distribution curve as the rate of change is gradual and cumulative

If two populations of a species become geographically separated then
they will likely experience different ecological conditions

-   Over time, the two populations will adapt to the different
    environmental conditions and gradually diverge from one another

The degree of divergence will depend on the extent of geographical
separation and the amount of time since separationÂ occurred

-   Populations located in close proximity that separated recently will
    show less variation (less divergence)
-   Distant populations that separated a longer period of time ago will
    show more variation (more divergence)

Variation Within a Population

[cat variation]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Populations of a species can gradually diverge into separate
species via evolution

Â  Â Â 
The degree of divergence between geographically separated
populationsÂ will gradually increaseÂ the longer they are separated

-   As the genetic divergence between the related populations increase,
    their geneticÂ compatibility consequently decreases
-   Eventually, the two populations will diverge to an extent where they
    can no longer interbreed if returned to a shared environment

When two populations can no longer interbreed and produce fertile,
viable offspring they are considered to be separate species

-   The evolutionary process by which two related populations diverge
    intoÂ separate species is called speciation

Adaptations

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Adaptations are characteristics that make an individual suited to
its environment and way of life

â€¢ Â Individuals that reproduce pass on characteristics to their
offspring

Â  Â Â 
Adaptations are features of organisms that aid their survival by
allowing them to be better suited to their environment

These adaptations may be classified in a number of different ways:

-   Structural: Â Physical differences in biological structure (e.g.
    neck length of a giraffe)
-   Behavioural: Â Differences in patterns of activity (e.g. opossums
    feigning death when threatened)
-   Physiological: Â Variations in detection and response by vital
    organs (e.g. homeothermy, colour perception)
-   Biochemical: Â Differences in molecular composition of cells and
    enzyme functions (e.g. blood groups, lactose tolerance)
-   Developmental: Â Variable changes that occur across the life span of
    an organism (e.g. patterns of ageing / senescence)

Biological adaptations have a genetic basis (i.e. encoded by genes) and
may be passed to offspring when the parents reproduce

-   Organisms with beneficial adaptations will be more likely to survive
    long enough to reproduce and pass on these genes
-   Organisms without these beneficial adaptations will be less likely
    to survive long enough to reproduce and pass on their genes

Hence adaptations result in differential reproduction within a species,
allowing for natural selection to occur

Â  Â Â 
Adaptive radiation describes the rapid evolutionary diversification of a
single ancestral line

-   It occurs when members of a single species occupy a variety of
    distinct niches with different environmental conditions
-   Consequently, members evolve different morphological features
    (adaptations) in response to the different selection pressures

An example of adaptive radiation can be seen in the variety of beak
types seen in the finches of the Galapagos Islands

-   These finches have specialised beak shapes depending on their
    primary source of nutrition (e.g. seeds, insects, nuts, nectar)

Adaptive Radiation

[adaptive radiation]

Daphne Major

Daphne Major is a volcanic island that forms part of the archipelago
that is collectively referred to as the Galapagos Islands

-   It is the native habitat of a variety of bird species known as
    Darwinâ€™s finches (subfamily: Geospizinae)

Darwinâ€™s finches demonstrate adaptive radiation and show marked
variation in beak size and shape according to diet

-   Finches that feed on seeds possess compact, powerful beaks â€“ with
    larger beaks better equipped to crack larger seed cases

In 1977, an extended drought changed the frequency of larger beak sizes
within the population by natural selection

-   Dry conditions result in plants producing larger seeds with tougher
    seed casings
-   Between 1976 and 1978 there was a change in average beak depth
    within the finch population
-   Finches with larger beaks were better equipped to feed on the seeds
    and thus produced more offspring with larger beaks

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Individuals that are better adapted tend to survive and produce
more offspring while the less well adapted tend

Â  Â  to die or produce fewer offspring

Â  Â Â 
The variation that exists within a population is heritable (i.e.
genetic) and determined by the presence of alleles

-   These alleles may be passed from parent to offspring via sexual
    reproduction

Alleles encode for the phenotypic polymorphisms of a particular trait
and may be beneficial, detrimental or neutral:

-   Beneficial alleles will better equip the organism to survive and
    hence produce more offspring (encodes beneficial adaptations)
-   Detrimental alleles will harm the survival prospects of an organism,
    leading to fewer viable offspring
-   Neutral alleles will not affect the organisms survival prospects

Due to natural selection, the proportion of different alleles will
change across generations (evolution)

-   As beneficial alleles improve reproductive prospects (more
    offspring), they are more likely to be passed on to future
    generations
-   Conversely, detrimental alleles result in fewer offspring and hence
    are less likely to be present in future generations

If environmental conditions change, what constitutes a beneficial or
detrimental trait may change, and thus the allele frequencies in a
population are constantly evolving

Application:

â€¢ Â Evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria

Â  Â Â 
Antibiotics are chemicals produced by microbes that either kill
(bactericidal) or inhibit the growth (bacteriostatic) of bacteria

-   Antibiotics are commonly used by man as a treatment for bacterial
    infections (not effective against viral infections)

In a bacterial colony, over many generations, a small proportion of
bacteria may develop antibiotic resistance via gene mutation

-   When treated with antibiotics, the resistant bacteria will survive
    and reproduce by binary fission (asexual reproduction)
-   The antibiotic resistant bacteria will flourish in the absence of
    competition from other strains of bacteria (killed by antibiotic)
-   Antibiotic resistant bacteria may also confer resistance to
    susceptible strains by transferring plasmids via bacterial
    conjugation
-   The introduction of antibiotic (selection pressure) has caused the
    antibiotic resistance gene to become more frequent (evolution)

An example of antibiotic resistance in bacteria can be seen in the
evolution of Staphylococcus aureus (Golden staph)

-   Golden staph can cause infections to the skin (lesions and boils) as
    well as more serious infections (pneumonia, meningitis)
-   Historically, these infections were treated using the antibiotic
    methicillinÂ 
-   Bacterial strains developed that were resistant to this antibiotic
    (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus â€“ or MRSA)
-   These strains proliferated whileÂ susceptible strains died
    outÂ (methicillin-sensitiveÂ Staphylococcus aureusÂ â€“ or MSSA)
-   MRSA infections are now especially present in hospitals and nursing
    homes, where the use of methicillin was most common
-   Medical practitioners now prescribe alternate antibiotic agents to
    treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus

Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria

[antibiotic resistance]
Artificial Gene Transfer

The inheritance of particular characteristics results from the
transmission of associated genes from one generation to the next

-   As this transmission requires reproduction by the organism/s and
    occurs across generations it is called vertical gene transfer
-   Typically, the only way for most organisms to develop particular
    genetic traits is via inheriting them from their parents

Bacteria can transfer genes between organisms within a generation via
the exchange of plasmids by bacterial conjugation

-   This transmission is called horizontal gene transfer as it occurs
    within a single generation

Humans have adapted the process by extracting plasmids from bacteria and
using them as a vector to deliver genes of interest

-   This has allowed humans to transfer genes not only within
    generations, but between separate species
-   This form of evolutionary modification is a type of artificial
    selection as it occurs as a direct result of human intervention

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Species tend to produce more offspring than the environment can
support

Â  Â Â 
The Malthusian dilemma was proposed by English clergyman Thomas Malthus
who identified that populations multiply geometrically (i.e. exponential
progression), while food resources only increase arithmetically (i.e.
linear progression)

-   In other words, species tend to produce more offspring than the
    environment can sustainably support

If left to follow course, a stable population will inevitably outgrow
its resource base, leading to competition for survival

-   When there is an abundance of resources, Â a population will grow
    according to its biotic potential (exponential J-curve)
-   With more offspring, there are less resources available to other
    members of the population (environmental resistance)
-   This will lead to a struggle for survival and an increase in the
    mortality rate (causing population growth to slow and plateau)

This concept is central to Darwinâ€™s understanding ofÂ â€˜survival of
the fittestâ€™ â€“ any trait that is beneficial for competitive survival
will be more likely to be passed on to offspring according to natural
selection

Essential Idea:
The diversity of life has evolved and
continues to evolve by natural selection

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   NaturalÂ selection can only occur if there is variation among
    members of the same species
-   Mutation, meiosis and sexual reproduction cause variation between
    individuals in a species
-   Adaptations are characteristics that make an individual suited to
    its environment and way of life
-   Species tend to produce more offspring than the environment can
    support
-   Individuals that are better adapted tend to survive and produce more
    offspring while the less well adapted tend to die or produce fewer
    offspring
-   Individuals that reproduce pass on characteristics to their
    offspring
-   Natural selection increases theÂ frequency of characteristics that
    make individuals better adapted and decreases the frequency of other
    characteristics leading to changes within the species

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural selection increases the frequency of characteristics that
make individuals better adapted and decreasesÂ 

Â  Â  the frequency of other characteristics leading to changes within
the species

Â  Â Â 
The theory of natural selection was posited by Charles Darwin (and also
Alfred Wallace) who described it asÂ â€˜survival of the fittestâ€™

-   According to this theory, it is not necessarily the strongest or
    most intelligent that survives, but the ones most responsive to
    change

The process of natural selection occurs in response to a number of
conditions:

-   Inherited Variation â€“ There is genetic variation within a
    population which can be inherited
-   Competition â€“ There is a struggle for survival (species tend to
    produce more offspring than the environment can support)
-   Selection â€“ Environmental pressures lead to differential
    reproduction within a population
-   Adaptations â€“ Individuals with beneficial traits will be more
    likely to survive and pass these traits on to their offspring
-   Evolution â€“ Over time, there is a change in allele frequency
    within the population gene pool

Process of Natural Selection

[natural selection]

Natural Selection Mnemonic

[ice age]

The key components to the process of natural selection are:

-   Inherited variation exists within the population
-   Competition results from an overproduction of offspring
-   Environmental pressures lead to differential reproduction
-   Adaptations which benefit survival are selected for
-   Genotype frequency changes across generations
-   Evolution occurs within the population

Selection Pressures

Selection pressures are external agents which affect an organismâ€™s
ability to survive in a given environment

-   Selection pressures can be negative (decreases the occurrence of a
    trait) or positive (increases the proportion of a trait)
-   Selection pressures may not remain constant, leading to changes in
    what constitutes a beneficial adaptation

Types of selection pressures include:

-   Resource availability â€“ Presence of sufficient food, habitat
    (shelter / territory) and mates
-   Environmental conditions â€“ Temperature, weather conditions or
    geographical access
-   Biological factors â€“ Predators and pathogens (diseases)

Selection pressures can be density-dependent (affected by population
size) or density-independent (unaffected by population)

Examples of Selection Pressures

[selection pressures]
Species Diversification

Evolution describes the cumulative changes that occur in the heritable
characteristics of a population

-   It can result in diversification within a species (microevolution)
    or diversification between species (macroevolution)

Microevolution

Microevolution describes evolutionary changes that occur within a short
period of geological time (e.g. between generations)

There are three main processes that promote variation within a
population (biodiversity):

-   Gene mutations: Â A change the genetic composition of an organism
    due to alterations in the DNA base sequence
-   Sexual reproduction: Â Introduces new gene combinations in offspring
    via random mating and meiotic divisions
-   Gene flow: Â The movement of alleles into (or out of) a population
    as a result of immigration or emigration

Variation within a gene pool can be reduced if conditions promote the
survival of certain traits and the removal of others

There are two main mechanisms for change which will reduce biodiversity
within a population:

-   Genetic drift: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as a
    result of a random or chance event
-   Natural selection: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as
    a result of differentially selective environmental pressures

Additionally, humans may change the composition of gene pools by
directly intervening in breeding processes (artificial selection)

Species Diversification and Microevolution

[species diversification]

Macroevolution

Macroevolution describes evolutionary changes that occur over relatively
long geological periods, resulting in speciation

-   Macroevolution involves changes in large populations and often is
    associated with significant environmental change
-   Not all populations undergo constant evolutionary modifications,
    some remain relatively unchanged (stasis)
-   When evolutionary changes prevent two related populations from
    interbreeding, then speciation has occurred
Theories of Evolution

Evolutionary theories began emerging in the 1800â€™s as new geological
and biological discoveries reformed existing knowledge

-   Previously, the dominant paradigm had described theÂ â€˜fixityâ€™ of
    species â€“ immutable and unchanging (man was always man)

LamarckÂ 

-   Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a French scientist, proposed that species
    changed as a result of the habitual use or disuse of a feature
-   Excessive use would cause a feature to develop, while continued
    disuse would cause it to atrophy (similar to muscle growth)
-   Lamarck proposed that these modified features could be passed on to
    successive generations, changing the species over time
-   Lamarckâ€™s theory however was essentially flawed â€“ cutting the
    tail off a rat does not produce tail-less offspring

Lamarckâ€™s Theory of Evolution (Use and Disuse)

[lamarck theory]

Darwin

-   Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution was based on a combination of
    Lamarckian ideas and recent fossil discoveries
-   He theorised that species living today had been changed over time
    and stemmed from a single (or few) ancestral organisms
-   He noted that although populations have the capacity to grow
    uncontrollably, limiting natural factors will restrict this growth
-   Organisms which possess traits better suited to conditions would
    have an adaptive advantage and be more likely to reproduce
-   These traits would hence become more common within the population
    and the species would gradually change over time
-   Similar ideas were proposed at the same time by Alfred Wallace (he
    corresponded with Darwin but published separately)

Darwinâ€™s Theory of Evolution (Natural Selection)

[darwin theory]

Neo Darwinism

-   Darwin knew very little about the mechanisms of variation (i.e.
    mutations) or the biological basis for inheritance (i.e. meiosis)
-   Neo-Darwinism is the synthesis of Darwinian theory and modern
    genetics â€“ it combines:
    -   The works of Gregor Mendel in describing how traits are
        inherited (Mendelian inheritance)
    -   The works of James Watson and Francis Crick in elucidating the
        genetic basis of inheritance (DNA structure)
Variation

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural selection can only occur if there is variation among
members of the same species

â€¢ Â Mutation, meiosis and sexual reproduction causes variation between
individuals in a species

Â  Â Â 
Natural selection requires variation among members of a species in order
to differentiate survival (variation needed for selection)

-   This variation can manifest as either discontinous (distinct
    classes) or continuous (range across a characteristic spectrum)

There are three main mechanisms by which genetic variation between
individuals in a species may occur:

-   Mutations â€“ Changing the genetic composition of gametes (germline
    mutation) leads to changed characteristics in offspring
-   Meiosis â€“ Via either crossing over (prophase I) or independent
    assortment (metaphase I)
-   Sexual reproduction â€“ The combination of genetic material from two
    distinct sources creates new gene combinations in offspring

Mutations

AÂ gene mutationÂ is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a section of
DNA coding for a specific trait

-   New alleles are formed by mutation

Gene mutations can be beneficial, detrimental or neutral

-   Beneficial mutations change the gene sequence (missense mutations)
    to create new variations of a trait
-   Detrimental mutations truncate the gene sequence (nonsense
    mutations) to abrogate the normal function of a trait
-   Neutral mutations have no effect on the functioning of the specific
    feature (silent mutations)

Variation via Mutation

[mutation variation]

Meiosis

Meiosis promotes variation by creating new gene combinations via either
crossing over or independent assortment
1. Â Crossing Over

Crossing over involves the exchange of segments of DNA between
homologous chromosomes during prophase I

-   The exchange of genetic material occurs betweenÂ non-sister
    chromatidsÂ at points calledÂ chiasmata

As a consequence of this recombination, all four chromatids that
comprise the bivalent will be genetically different

-   Chromatids that consist of a combination of DNA derived from both
    homologous chromosomes are calledÂ recombinants
-   Offspring with recombinant chromosomes will have unique gene
    combinations that are not present in either parentÂ 

[]

2. Â Independent Assortment

When homologous chromosomes line up in metaphase I, their orientation
towards the opposing poles isÂ random

The orientation of each bivalent occursÂ independently, meaning
different combinations of maternal / paternal chromosomes can be
inherited when bivalents separate in anaphase I

-   The total number of combinations that can occur in gametes is
    2^(n)Â â€“ whereÂ nÂ = haploid number of chromosomes
-   Humans have 46 chromosomes (n = 23) and thus can produce 8,388,608
    different gametes (2²³) by random orientationÂ 
-   If crossing over also occurs, the number of different gamete
    combinations becomesÂ immeasurable

[]

Sexual Reproduction

The fusion of two haploid gametes results in the formation of a diploid
zygote

-   This zygote can then divide by mitosis and differentiate to form a
    developing embryo

As meiosis results in genetically distinct gametes, random fertilisation
by egg and sperm will always generate different zygotes

-   This means that individual offspring will typically show variation
    despite shared parentage
-   Identical twins are formedÂ afterÂ fertilisation, by the complete
    fission of the zygote into two separate cell masses

Summary of Human Fertilisation

Animal Complexity

Animal phyla can be differentiated according to a number of features of
increasing complexity

-   These features include body symmetry, number of body openings, body
    segmentation and the presence of a notochord

Body Symmetry

-   Body symmetry describes the alignment of body parts around a central
    axis (radial = circular plane ; bilateral = linear plane)
-   Porifera are the most primitive of animals and lack any body
    symmetry (asymmetrical) as they have no true tissues or organs
-   Cnidaria are sedentary or slow moving and have radial symmetry, so
    as to experience the environment equally from all directionsÂ 
-   All other animals have bilateral symmetry, which promotes
    development of a head and allows for streamlined, directional
    movement

Types of Body Symmetry

[body symmetry]

Body Openings

-   Porifera are the most basic invertebrate and have no body openings
    â€“ instead they exchange materials through pores
-   Cnidaria and platyhelminths have a singular body opening, leading to
    a saccular digestive system
-   All other specified phyla have two body openings (i.e. a separate
    mouth and anus), resulting in a tubular digestive system
-   Having two body openings allows for specialisation of digestive
    processes as food is travelling in a single direction

Platyhelminth â€“ Saccular Digestive System

[platyhelminth]

Body Segmentation

-   Segmentation of body parts allows for the specialisation of function
    in these different areas
-   Organisms with more basic body plans (including porifera, cnidaria
    and platyhelminths) lack distinctive body segmentation
-   Organisms with more developed body plans have segmented bodies (e.g.
    annelids, mollusca, arthropoda, chordata)
-   Sometimes body segmentation may not be clearly visible â€“ all
    molluscs have a mantle, visceral mass and muscular foot but these
    segments may not be readily apparent through visual inspection

Body Segments in Mollusca

[body segments]

Chordates

-   All chordates share four key features: a notochord, a hollow dorsal
    nerve tube, pharyngeal slits and a postanal tail
-   These features are always present in an embryonic state, but might
    not always persist into adulthood
-   In vertebrates (a sub-phyla), the notochord is largely replaced and
    surrounded by vertebra, forming a backbone

Archaea vs Eubacteria

Traditional classification schemes separated organisms into two main
groups â€“ prokaryotes and eukaryotes

-   This classification scheme was widely entrenched until 1977 when
    Carl Woese proposed a new system

The large diversity of organisms classified as prokaryotes prompted
Woese to separate these bacteria into two distinct domains

-   Eubacteria includes most of the commonly encountered bacterial forms
    (i.e. pathogenic bacteria and probiotic bacteria)
-   Archaea consists of the extremophiles (e.g. thermophiles,
    halophiles, methanogens, etc.)

The archaeal cells were found to possess certain features that were more
in common with eukaryotic cells than eubacteria

-   This included certain structural features (e.g. cell wall
    composition) and the presence of histone-like proteins in DNA
-   Based on these discoveries it was concluded that eukaryotes and
    archaea share more recent common ancestry than eubacteria

biologists and has been agreed and developedÂ 

Â  Â  at a series of congresses

Â  Â Â 
The binomial system of nomenclature is the formal system by which all
living species are classified (taxonomy)

-   It was initially developed by a Swedish botanist named Carolus
    Linnaeus in 1735Â 
-   It is periodically assessed and updated at a series of international
    congresses which occur every 4 years

The binomial system of nomenclature provides value because:

-   It allows for the identification and comparison of organisms based
    on recognised characteristics
-   It allows all organisms to be named according to a globally
    recognised scheme
-   It can show how closely related organisms are, allowing for the
    prediction of evolutionary links
-   It makes it easier to collect, sort and group information about
    organisms

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â When species are discovered they are given scientific names using
the binomial system

Â  Â Â 
According to the binomial system of nomenclature, every organism is
designated a scientific name with two parts:

-   Genus is written first and is capitalised (e.g. Homo)
-   Species follows and is written in lower case (e.g. Homo sapiens)
-   Some species may occasionally have a sub-species designation (e.g.
    Homo sapiens sapiens â€“ modern man)

Writing conventions:

-   When typing the scientific name, it should be presented in italics
-   When hand writing the scientific name, it is customary to underline

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural classifications help in identification of species and
allow the prediction of characteristics shared byÂ 

Â  Â  species within a group

Â  Â Â 
Historically, there have been two main classification schemes used to
identify living organisms â€“ artificial and natural classification

-   Both use prominent features as the basis for classification, however
    differ in the way these characteristics are established

Artificial classification involves arbitrarily selecting unifying
characteristics first and then grouping organisms accordingly

-   The advantage of artificial classification is that such schemes are
    easy to develop and relatively stable (unlikely to change)
-   The disadvantage is that they do not generally show evolutionary
    relationships and for this reason are not commonly used
    -   For example, if organisms were classified according to the
        presence of fins then whales would be grouped with fish
    -   If organisms were classified based on the presence of shells
        then snails would be grouped with turtles and not with squid

Natural classification involves grouping organisms based on similarities
first and then identifying shared characteristics

-   According to a natural classification system, all members of a
    particular group would have shared a common ancestor
-   This means that natural classification schemes can be used to
    predict characteristics shared by species within a group
-   A disadvantage of such schemes is that they are highly mutable and
    tend to change as new information is discovered

A third type of classification â€“ phylogenetic classification â€“ is
now being used to differentiate organisms based on genetics

-   Organisms who share a greater level of homology in their DNA or
    amino acid sequences are expected to be more closely related

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In a natural classification, the genus and accompanying higher
taxa consist of all the species that have evolvedÂ 

Â  Â  from one common ancestral species

Â  Â Â 
An advantage of natural classification is that it identifies traits
based on groupings, rather than assigning groups based on traits

-   This means that it can be used to show evolutionary relationships
    and predict characteristics shared by species within a group

According to natural classification, each taxonomic level includes all
species that would have evolved from a common ancestor

-   Species of the same genus would have a common genus ancestor and be
    more closely related than species of the same order
-   Hence, organisms that share a lower taxa must share all higher taxa
    (e.g. if the same order then must also be the same class)

Identifying Evolutionary Relationships Using Natural Classification

[natural classification]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Taxonomists sometimes reclassify groups of species when new
evidence shows that a previous taxon contains

Â  Â  species that have evolved from different ancestral species

Â  Â Â 
A disadvantage of natural classifications is that because they predict
evolutionary relationships, they change with new information

-   Taxonomists will reclassify groups of species when new evidence
    arises to compromise the traditional classification scheme

Groups of species may be separated into different genera if new evidence
suggests they evolved from different ancestral species

-   Species originally classified as figworts have been reclassified
    into different genera based on DNA sequence comparisons

Alternatively, different species may be grouped into a sharedÂ taxon if
new evidence suggests more recent common ancestryÂ 

-   TheÂ Homininae sub-family was created to include gorillas and
    chimpanzees when it was deduced that they share more common ancestry
    with humans than with other great apes (e.g.Â orang-utan)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Construction of dichotomous keys for use in identifying specimens

Â  Â Â 
A dichotomous key is a method of identification whereby groups of
organisms are divided into two categories repeatedly

-   With each sequential division, more information is revealed about
    the specific features of a particular organism
-   When the organism no longer shares its totality of selected
    characteristics with any organism, it has been identified

When using a dichotomous key to identify specimens it is preferable to
use immutable features (i.e. features that do not change)

-   Size, colouration and behavioural patterns may all vary amongst
    individuals and across lifetimes
-   Physical structures (e.g number of limbs) and biological processes
    (e.g. reproduction methods) make for better characteristics

Dichotomous keys are usually represented in one of two ways:

-   As a branching flowchart (diagrammatic representation)
-   As a series of paired statements laid out in a numbered sequence
    (descriptive representation)

Below are some examples of dichotomous keys represented as both diagrams

Understanding:

â€¢ Â All organisms are classified into three domains

Â  Â Â 
Currently, all living organisms are classified into three domains:

-   Eukarya â€“ eukaryotic organisms that contain a membrane-bound
    nucleus (includes protist, plants, fungi and animals)
-   Archaea â€“ prokaryotic cells lacking a nucleus and consist of the
    extremophiles (e.g. methanogens, thermophiles, etc.)
-   Eubacteria â€“ prokaryotic cells lacking a nucleus and consist of
    the common pathogenic forms (e.g. E. coli, S. aureus, etc.)

Originally, the two prokaryotic domains were considered only as a single
kingdom (Monera), however biochemical differences were discovered
between the two groups which warranted their reclassification into
separate domains

Past Nomenclatures

The binomial system of nomenclature was devised by Carolus Linnaeus in
1735 as a method for identifying organisms

-   This initial system grouped all organisms into two kingdoms â€“
    vegetable (plants) and animal

The binomial system of nomenclature is still used by scientists today,
however several revisions have occurred over the years:

-   In 1866, Ernst Haeckel proposed the addition of a third kingdom â€“
    Protista
-   In 1925, Edouard Chatton recognised the distinction between
    prokaryotes and eukaryotes and proposed a two empire system
-   In 1938, Herbert Copeland incorporated prokaryotic cells into a
    fourth kingdom â€“ Monera
-   In 1969, Robert Whittaker proposed a five kingdom system, which
    included a kingdom for Fungi
-   In 1977, Carl Woese identified differences in prokaryotes and in
    1990 proposed the currently recognised three domain system

Virus Classification

Viruses do not share the same classification system as organisms because
they are not considered to be living

-   Viruses do not have metabolism and can only reproduce using the
    cellular machinery of an infected host cell

Viruses are classified mainly according to phenotypic characteristics,
including:

-   Morphology (e.g. helical, icosohedral, spherical, complex)
-   Nucleic acid type (e.g. DNA = adenovirus ; RNA = retrovirus)
-   Method of viral replication (e.g. lytic vs lysogenic cycles)
-   Host organisms (e.g. bacteriophages)

Â  Â Â 
Until recently, figworts were the 8^(th) largest family of flowering
plants (angiosperms), containing 275 different genera

-   This was problematic as many of the figwort plants were too
    dissimilar in structure to function as a meaningful grouping

Taxonomists examined the chloroplast gene in figworts and decided to
split the figwort species into five different clades

-   Now less than half of the species remain in the figwort family â€“
    which is now the 36^(th) largest among angiosperms

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A clade is a group of organisms that have evolved from a common
ancestor

Â  Â Â 
Cladistics is a method of classifying organisms into groups of species
called clades (from GreekÂ â€˜klados' = branch)

-   Each clade consists of an ancestral organism and all of its
    evolutionary descendants
-   Members of a clade will possess common characteristics as a result
    of their shared evolutionary lineage

Clades can be organised according to branching diagrams (cladograms) in
order to show evolutionary relationships

Examples of Clades

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cladograms are tree diagrams that show the most probable sequence
of divergence in clades

Â  Â Â 
Cladograms are tree diagrams where each branch point represents the
splitting of two new groups from a common ancestor

-   Each branch point (node) represents a speciation event by which
    distinct species are formed via divergent evolution

Cladograms show the probable sequence of divergence and hence
demonstrate the likely evolutionary history (phylogeny) of a clade

-   The fewer the number of nodes between two groups the more closely
    related they are expected to be

Application:

â€¢ Â Cladograms including humans and other primates

Â  Â Â 
Cladograms can show evolutionary relationships and demonstrate how
recently two groups shared a common ancestry

-   As each node represents a point of divergence, closely related
    species will be separated by fewer nodes

According to a cladogram outlining the evolutionary history of humans
and other primates:

-   Humans, chimpanzees, gorillas,Â orangutansÂ and gibbons all belong
    to a common clade â€“ the Hominoids
-   The Hominoid clade forms part of a larger clade â€“ the Anthropoids
    â€“ which includes Old World and New World monkeysÂ

Â  Â Â 
Constructed cladograms all typically share certain key features:

-   Root â€“ The initial ancestor common to all organisms within the
    cladogram (incoming line shows it originates from a larger clade)
-   Nodes â€“ Each node corresponds to a hypothetical common ancestor
    thatÂ speciated to give rise to two (or more) daughter taxa
-   Outgroup â€“ The most distantly related species in the cladogram
    which functions as a point of comparison and reference group
-   Clades â€“ A common ancestor and all of its descendants (i.e. a node
    and all of its connected branches)

Key Features of a Cladogram

[cladogram features]

Constructing Cladograms

Cladograms can be constructed based on either a comparison of
morphological (structural) features or molecular evidence

-   Historically, structural features were used to construct cladograms,
    but molecular evidence is now more commonly used

1. Â Using Structural Evidence

Step 1: Â Organise selected organisms according to defined
characteristics

-   Use characteristics that are developmentally fixed (i.e. innate) and
    not influenced by environmental pressures

[cladogram table]

Step 2: Â Sequentially order organisms according to shared
characteristics to construct a cladogram

-   Grouping of organisms may be facilitated by constructing a Venn
    diagram prior to developing a cladogram
-   Each characteristic will be represented by a node, with more common
    characteristics representing earlier nodes
-   The species with the least number of characteristics in common will
    represent theÂ outgroup (establishes baseline properties)

[cladogram construction]

2. Â Using Molecular Evidence

Step 1: Â Select a gene or protein common to a range of selected
organisms

-   Examples of molecules which are ubiquitously found in many animals
    include haemoglobin and cytochrome c

Step 2: Â Copy the molecular sequence (DNA or amino acid) for each of
the selected organisms

-   Use online databases such as Genbank orÂ Ensembl to identify
    relevant DNA or amino acid sequences
-   Sequences can be collated in a Word document and then saved as a
    document in plain text format (.txt)Â 
-   Before each sequence, designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)

Step 3: Â Run a multiple alignment to compare molecular sequences (DNA
or amino acid)

-   Multiple alignment software compares DNA or protein sequences for
    similarities and differences
-   Closely related species are expected to have a higher degree of
    similarity in their molecular sequence
-   Clustal Omega is a free online tool that will align multiple DNA or
    amino acid sequences for comparison

Step 4: Â Generate a phylogeny tree (cladogram) from multiple alignment
data

-   Clustal Omega can generate branched phylograms after a sequence
    alignment is completed (selectÂ â€˜Phylogenetic Treeâ€™)
-   Below is a plain text file that can be uploaded to compare amino
    acid sequences from different species:

        various species

5.4 Â Cladistics

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The ancestry of groups of species can be deduced
by comparing their base or amino acid sequences

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   A clade is a group of organisms that have evolved from a common
    ancestor
-   Cladograms are tree diagrams that show the most probable sequence of
    divergence in clades
-   Evidence for which species are part of a clade can be obtained from
    the base sequence of a gene or the corresponding amino acid sequence
    of a protein
-   Sequence differences accumulate gradually so there is a positive
    correlation between the number of differences between two species
    and the time since they diverged from a common ancestor
-   Traits can be analogous or homologous
-   Evidence from cladistics has shown that classification of some
    groups based on structure did not correspond with the evolutionary
    origins of a group or species

Applications:

-   Cladograms including humans and other primates
-   Reclassification of the figwort family using evidence from
    cladistics

Skills:

-   Analysis of cladograms to deduce evolutionary relationships
In Situ Hybridisation

Molecular evidence for phylogenetic relationships involves identifying
conservation in DNA or amino acid sequences

One technique used to identify conservation in gene sequences is DNA â€“
DNA hybridisation

-   DNA is double stranded and is held together by hydrogen bonds
    between complementary base pairs
-   DNA from different species can be separated into single strands with
    sufficient heat and then mixed together
-   If two strands from different species share similar sequences they
    will hybridise (anneal together to form a double strand)
-   The amount of heat then required to separate this hybrid molecule
    indicates how similar the two sequences are
-   More heat indicates more hydrogen bonds formed, meaning more
    complementary base pairing due to similar sequences
-   Less heat indicates fewer hydrogen bonds formed, meaning less base
    pairing has occurred because sequences are dissimilar

DNA-DNA Hybridisation

[in situ hybridisation]
Mitochondrial DNA

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an important tool for tracing evolutionary
relationshipsÂ within a species

Mitochondrial DNA offers several benefits over nuclear DNA when
determining phylogenetic pathways, including:

-   Maternal inheritance â€“ mtDNA is inherited from the mother only,
    providing a much more direct genetic lineage
-   No recombination â€“ As mtDNA is passed from the mother, no
    recombination occurs, maintaining sequence fidelity
-   Higher mutation rate â€“ Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen
    species, which cause sequences to mutate at a higher rate
-   High copy number â€“ As every cell has mitochondria, large amounts
    of mtDNA can be gathered for sequencing

Mitochondrial DNA is ideal for comparing organisms within a species or
those who have diverged recently (> 20 million years)

-   Evidence from mtDNA has been used to divide the human population
    into distinct haplogroups
-   Humans can trace their origins back to one of seven
    super-haplogroups originating from an original 'Mitochondrial Eveâ€™

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evidence for which species are part of a clade can be obtained
from the base sequence of a gene or theÂ 

Â  Â  corresponding amino acid sequence of a protein

Â  Â Â 
All organisms use DNA and RNA as genetic material and the genetic code
by which proteins are synthesised is (almost) universal

-   This shared molecular heritage means that base and amino acid
    sequences can be compared to ascertain levels of relatedness

Over the course of millions of years, mutations will accumulate within
any given segment of DNA

-   The number of differences between comparable base sequences
    demonstrates the degree of evolutionary divergence
-   A greater number of differences between comparable base sequences
    suggests more time has past since two species diverged
-   Hence, the more similar the base sequences of two species are, the
    more closely related the two species are expected to be

When comparing molecular sequences, scientists may use non-coding DNA,
gene sequences or amino acid sequences

-   Non-coding DNA provides the best means of comparison as mutations
    will occur more readily in these sequences
-   Gene sequences mutate at a slower rate, as changes to base sequence
    may potentially affect protein structure and function
-   Amino acid sequences may also be used for comparison, but will have
    the slowest rate of change due to codon degeneracy

Amino acid sequences are typically used to compare distantly related
species (i.e. different taxa), while DNA or RNA base sequences are often
used to compare closely related organisms (e.g. different haplogroups
â€“ such as various human ethnic groups)

Comparison of the Haemoglobin Beta Chain in Different Species

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Sequence differences accumulate gradually so there is a positive
correlation between the number of differencesÂ 

Â  Â  between two species and the time since they diverged from a common
ancestor

Â  Â Â 
Some genes or protein sequences may accumulate mutations at a relatively
constant rate (e.g. 1 change per million years)

If this rate of change is reliable, scientists can calculate the time of
divergence according to the number of differences

-   E.g.Â  If a gene which mutates at a rate of 1 bp per 100,000 years
    has 6 bp different, divergence occurred 600,000 years ago

This concept is called the molecular clock and is limited by a number of
factors:

-   Different genes or proteins may change at different rates (e.g.
    haemoglobin mutates more rapidly than cytochrome c)
-   The rate of change for a particular gene may differ between
    different groups of organisms
-   Over long periods, earlier changes may be reversed by later changes,
    potentially confounding the accuracy of predictions

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evidence from cladistics has shown that classification of some
groups based on structure did not correspond

Â  Â  with the evolutionary origins of a group or species

Â  Â Â 
Historically, classification was based primarily on morphological
differences (i.e. structural characteristics)

-   Closely related species were expected to show similar structural
    features, indicating common ancestry

However, there are two key limitations to using morphological
differences as a basis for classification:

-   Closely related organisms can exhibit very different structural
    features due to adaptive radiation (e.g. pentadactyl limb)
-   Distantly related organisms can display very similar structural
    features due to convergent evolution

Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features in
species with distinct lineages

-   It may occur when different species occupy the same habitat and are
    thus subjected to the same selection pressures
-   The shared conditions cause common adaptations to be selected in
    different species, resulting in structural similarity
    -   An example of convergent evolution is the development of wings
        in birds, bats and insects

Convergent Evolution

[convergent evolution]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Traits can be analogous or homologous

Â  Â Â 
Structural traits are not commonly used to determine clades as such
features may not necessarily indicate shared heritage

-   Traits that are similar because they are derived from common
    ancestry are termed homologous structuresÂ 
-   Traits that are superficially similar but were derived through
    separate evolutionary pathways are termed analogous structures

[homology vs analogy table]

Using molecular evidence, scientists have discovered that many species
thought to be closely related based on shared structural characteristics
actually demonstrate distinct evolutionary origins

-   Crocodiles have been shown to be more closely related to birds than
    lizards, despite closely resembling lizards in structure
-   Many species of plants previously classified as figworts have been
    reclassified based on molecular evidence

-   Different monomers undertake different methods for crossing the
    apical and basolateral membranes

Membrane Transport Mechanisms

Secondary Active Transport

-   A transport protein couples the active translocation of one molecule
    to the passive movement of another (co-transport)
-   Glucose and amino acids are co-transported across the epithelial
    membrane by the active translocation of sodium ions (Na⁺)

Facilitated Diffusion

-   Channel proteins help hydrophilic food molecules pass through the
    hydrophobic portion of the plasma membrane
-   Channel proteins are often situated near specific membrane-bound
    enzymes (creates a localised concentration gradient)
-   Certain monosaccharides (e.g. fructose), vitamins and some minerals
    are transported by facilitated diffusion

Osmosis

-   Water molecules will diffuse across the membrane in response to the
    movement of ions and hydrophilic monomers (solutes)
-   The absorption of water and dissolved ions occurs in both the small
    and large intestine

Simple Diffusion

-   Hydrophobic materials (e.g. lipids) may freely pass through the
    hydrophobic portion of the plasma membrane
-   Once absorbed, lipids will often pass first into the lacteals rather
    than being transported via the blood

Methods of Membrane Transport

[absorption methods]

Bulk Transport

Endocytosis

-   Endocytosis involves the invagination of the plasma membrane to
    create an internal vesicle containing extracellular material
-   Vesicle formation requires the breaking and reforming of the
    phospholipid bilayer and hence is an energy-dependent process
-   In the intestines, vesicles commonly form around fluid containing
    dissolved materials (pinocytosis â€“ cellÂ â€˜drinkingâ€™)
-   Pinocytosis allows materials to be ingested en masse and hence takes
    less time than shuttling via membrane proteins

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes digest most macromolecules in food into monomers in the
small intestine

Â  Â Â 
Food can be digested by a combination of two methods â€“ mechanical
digestion and chemical digestion

-   InÂ chemicalÂ digestion, food is broken down by the action of
    chemical agents (such as enzymes, acids and bile)

Stomach Acids

-   The stomach contains gastric glands which release digestive acids to
    create a low pH environment (pH ~2)
-   The acidic environment functions to denature proteins and other
    macromolecules, aiding in their overall digestion
-   The stomach epithelium contains a mucous membrane which prevents the
    acids from damaging the gastric lining
-   The pancreas releases alkaline compounds (e.g. bicarbonate ions),
    which neutralise the acids as they enter the intestineÂ 

Bile

-   The liver produces a fluid called bile which is stored and
    concentrated within the gall bladder prior to release into the
    intestine
-   Bile contains bile salts which interact with fat globules and divide
    them into smaller droplets (emulsification)
-   The emulsification of fats increases the total surface area
    available for enzyme activity (lipase)

Enzymes

-   Enzymes are biological catalysts which speed up the rate of a
    chemical reaction (i.e. digestion) by lowering activation energy
-   Enzymes allow digestive processes to therefore occur at body
    temperatures and at sufficient speeds for survival requirements
-   Enzymes are specific for a substrate and so can allow digestion of
    certain molecules to occur independently in distinct locations

Examples of Digestive Enzymes

[digestive enzymes]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The pancreas secretes enzymes into the lumen of the small
intestine

Â  Â Â 
Digestive enzymes are secreted predominantly by the pancreas, although
other organs also contribute (salivary gland, stomach)

-   The type of enzyme secreted and location of secretion depends on the
    specific macromolecule required for hydrolysis

Carbohydrates

-   Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth with the release of
    amylase from the salivary glands (amylase = starch digestion)
-   Amylase is also secreted by the pancreas in order to continue
    carbohydrate digestion within the small intestine
-   Enzymes for disaccharide hydrolysis are often immobilised on the
    epithelial lining of the small intestine, near channel proteins
-   Humans do not possess an enzyme capable of digesting cellulose
    (cellulase) and hence it passes through the body undigested

Proteins

-   Protein digestion begins in the stomach with the release of
    proteases that function optimally in an acidic pH (e.g. pepsin = pH
    2)
-   Smaller polypeptide chains enter the small intestine where they are
    broken down by endopeptidases released by the pancreas
-   These endopeptidases work optimally in neutral environments (pH ~ 7)
    as the pancreas neutralises the acids in the intestine

Lipids

-   Lipid breakdown occurs in the intestines, beginning with
    emulsification of fat globules by bile released from the gall
    bladder
-   The smaller fat droplets are then digested by lipases released from
    the pancreas

Nucleic Acids

-   The pancreas also releases nucleases which digest nucleic acids
    (DNA, RNA) into smaller nucleosides

There are two major groups of organs which comprise the human digestive
system:

-   The alimentary canal consists of organs through which food actually
    passes (oesophagus, stomach, small & large intestine)
-   The accessory organs aid in digestion but do not actually transfer
    food (salivary glands, pancreas, liver, gall bladder)

Oesophagus

â€¢ Â A hollow tube connecting the oral cavity to the stomach (separated
from the trachea by the epiglottis)

â€¢ Â Food is mixed with saliva and then is moved in a bolus via the
action of peristalsis

[stomach icon]

Stomach

â€¢ Â A temporary storage tank where food is mixed by churning and
protein digestion begins

â€¢ Â It is lined by gastric pits that release digestive juices, which
create an acidic environment (pH ~2)

[small intestine icon]

Small Intestine

(nutrients) are absorbed

â€¢ Â Consists of three sections â€“ the duodenum, jejunum and ileum

[large intestine icon]

Large Intestine

â€¢ Â The final section of the alimentary canal, where water and
dissolved minerals (i.e. ions) are absorbed

â€¢ Â Consists of the ascending / transverse / descending / sigmoidal
colon, as well as the rectumÂ 

Accessory Organs:

[salivary gland icon]

Salivary Glands

â€¢ Â Release saliva to moisten food and contains enzymes (e.g. amylase)
to initiate starch breakdownÂ 

â€¢ Â Salivary glands include the parotid gland, submandibular gland and
sublingual gland

them to make key chemicals

â€¢ Â Its role includes detoxification, storage, metabolism, bile
production and haemoglobin breakdown

are used to emulsify fats)

â€¢ Â Bile stored in the gall bladder is released into the small
intestine via the common bile duct

Drawing of a Human Digestive System

Key Features:

-   Stomach should look like aÂ â€˜Jâ€™-shaped bag and be connected to
    the oesophagus and small intestine
-   Liver should look like a right-angled triangle and be superimposed
    to the left of the stomach (right side of the human)
-   Bile duct (connected to gall bladder) and pancreatic duct should
    both feed into a U-shaped bend of the small intestine
-   Small intestine should be thinner in width than the large intestine
6.1 Â Digestion and Absorption

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The structure of the wall of the small intestine
allows it to move, digest and absorb food

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The contraction of circular and longitudinal muscle of the small
    intestine mixes the food with enzymes and moves it along the gut
-   Enzymes digest most macromolecules in food into monomers in the
    small intestine
-   The pancreas secretes enzymes into the lumen of the small intestine
-   Villi increase the surface area of epithelium over which absorption
    is carried out
-   Villi absorb monomers formed by digestion as well as mineral ions
    and vitamins
-   Different methods of membrane transport are required to absorb
    different nutrients

Applications:

-   Processes occurring in the small intestine that result in the
    digestion of starch and transport of the products of digestion to
    the liver
-   Use of dialysis tubing to model absorption of digested food in the
    intestine

Skills:

-   Production of an annotated diagram of the digestive system
-   Identification of tissue layers in transverse sections of the small
    intestine viewed with a microscope or in a micrograph
Lipid Absorption

Lipids within the digestive system will tend to hydrophobically
aggregate to form large fat globules

-   Bile salts, secreted from the gall bladder, emulsify these fat
    globules and break them up into smaller droplets
-   Hydrolytic enzymes calledÂ lipases then digest the fats into their
    component parts

When the fatty acids are absorbed into the epithelial cells of the
intestinal lining, they are combined to form triglycerides

-   The triglycerides are combined with proteins inside the Golgi
    apparatus to form chylomicrons
-   Chylomicrons are released from the epithelial cells and are
    transported via the lacteals to the liver

While in the liver, chylomicrons may be modified to form a variety of
lipoproteins

-   Low density lipoproteins will transport lipids via the bloodstream
    to cells
-   High density lipoproteins will scavenge excess lipids from the
    bloodstream and tissues and return them to the liver

Lipid Absorption and Transport

[lipid metabolism]
Lipid Digestion

Lipids are hydrophobic (waterÂ â€˜hatingâ€™) and hence tend to be
insoluble within the aqueous environments of the body

-   Being hydrophobic, lipids will group together (coalesce) to form
    large globules of fats

The enzyme responsible for lipid digestion (lipase) is generally water
soluble and is only hydrophobic at the active site

-   This means lipase can only bind to lipid globules at the lipid-water
    interface (i.e. the outer extremity of the globule)
-   As the interior of the fat globule is inaccessible to lipase,
    digestion of lipids in this form is normally very slow

Bile is a watery fluid that contains bile salts and pigments (bilirubin)
â€“ it is made by the liver and released from the gall bladder

-   Bile salt molecules have both a hydrophobic surface and a
    hydrophilic surface
-   The hydrophobic end interacts with the lipid while the hydrophilic
    end faces out and prevents lipids from coalescing
-   This divides the fat globule into smaller droplets (emulsification),
    increasing the total surface area available for enzyme activityÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The contraction of circular and longitudinal muscle of the small
intestine mixes food with enzymes and moves it

Â  Â Â along the gut

Â  Â Â 
Food can be digested by a combination of two methods â€“ mechanical
digestion and chemical digestion

-   In mechanical digestion, food is physically broken down into smaller
    fragments via the acts of chewing (mouth), churning (stomach) and
    segmentation (small intestine)

Mechanical Digestion

Chewing (Mouth)

-   Food is initially broken down in the mouth by the grinding action of
    teeth (chewing or mastication)
-   The tongue pushes the food towards the back of the throat, where it
    travels down the esophagus as a bolus
-   The epiglottis prevents the bolus from entering the trachea, while
    the uvula prevents the bolus from entering the nasal cavity

Churning (Stomach)

-   The stomach lining contains muscles which physically squeeze and mix
    the food with strong digestive juices ('churningâ€™)
-   Food is digested within the stomach for several hours and is turned
    into a creamy paste called chyme
-   Eventually the chyme enters the small intestine (duodenum) where
    absorption will occur

Movement of Food

Peristalsis

-   Peristalsis is the principal mechanism of movement in the
    oesophagus, although it also occurs in both the stomach and gut
-   Continuous segments of longitudinal smooth muscle rhythmically
    contract and relax
-   Food is moved unidirectionally along the alimentary canal in a
    caudal direction (mouth to anus)

This browser cannot play the embedded video file.

Segmentation

-   Segmentation involves the contraction and relaxation of non-adjacent
    segments of circular smooth muscle in the intestines
-   Segmentation contractions move chyme in both directions, allowing
    for a greater mixing of food with digestive juices
-   While segmentation helps to physically digest food particles, its
    bidirectional propulsion of chyme can slow overall movementÂ

Modelling Digestion

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of dialysis tubing to model absorption of digested foods in
the intestine

Â  Â Â 
Most food is solid and in the form of large complex molecules which are
insolube and chemically inert (not readily usable)

The process of digestion therefore performs two key functions:

-   It breaks down insoluble molecules into smaller subunits which can
    be readily absorbed into body tissues
-   It breaks down inert molecules into usable subunits which can be
    assimilated by cells and reassembled into new products

Modelling Digestion

A core function of the digestive system is to break down large molecules
into smaller subunits that can be absorbed by cells

-   Cell membranes are impermeable to large molecules (polypeptides,
    polysaccharides) unless transport is facilitated by proteins

The size-specific permeability of cell membranes can be modelled using
dialysis tubing (Visking tubing)

-   Dialysis tubing contains pores typically ranging from 1 - 10 nm in
    diameter and is semi-permeable according to molecular size
-   Large molecules such as starch cannot pass through the tubing,
    however smaller molecules (such as maltose) can cross
-   Unlike the membranes of living cells, dialysis tubing is not
    selectively permeable based on charge (ions can freely cross)

Dialysis Tubing

[dialysis tubing]

Digestion Experiments

Digestive enzymes like amylase can break down inpermeable polymers
(starch) into permeable subunits (maltose)

-   Dialysis tubing is impermeable to amylase and starch, but permeable
    to maltose (and water)

Experiment 1: Â Measuring Meniscus Levels

-   A length of dialysis tubing is attached to a thistle funnel and
    filled with starch solution (control condition)
-   A second length of tubing is attached to a thistle funnel and filled
    with starch and amylase solution (experimental condition)
-   Both apparatuses are placed in a beaker filled with water
-   Over time, water will move into the tubing via osmosis (towards the
    solute) causing the meniscus level to rise
-   The tube with amylase will have less solute (as starch is digested)
    and hence the meniscus level should not rise as much

Experiment 2: Â Measuring Maltose Diffusion

-   A length of dialysis tubing is filled with starch solution and
    suspended in a beaker of water (control condition)
-   A second length of tubing is filled with starch and amylase solution
    and suspended in a beaker of water (experimental condition)
-   The amylase will digest the starch into maltose, which is small
    enough to diffuse out of the tubing and into the beaker
-   The presence of maltose can be detected using Benedictâ€™s reagent
    or glucose indicator strips

Using Dialysis Tubing to Model Digestive Processes (Starch Breakdown and
Maltose Absorption)

[digestion experiments]
Sections of the Gut

The intestines are a long continuous tube â€“ running from stomach to
anus â€“ where the absorption of nutrients and water occurs

-   The intestines can be divided into the small intestines (nutrient
    absorption) and large intestines (water absorption)

Small Intestines

The small intestine is comprised of three distinct regions: duodenum,
jejunum and ileum
Duodenum

-   First segment of the small intestine which is fed by digestive
    fluids from the pancreas and gall bladder
-   Bile emulsifies fat globules into smaller droplets and pancreatic
    juice contains digestive enzymes
-   Sodium bicarbonate is released from the pancreas to neutralise
    stomach acids such that intestinal pH is ~ 7

Jejunum

-   Second segment of the small intestine where the digestive process is
    largely completed
-   Pancreatic enzymes and enzymes released from intestinal glands
    complete the break down of sugars, proteins and lipids

Ileum

-   Final segment of the small intestine with the principal function of
    nutrient absorption
-   The intestinal tract is highly folded (villi and microvilli) to
    increase surface area and optimise material absorption
-   Bile is also absorbed here and returned to the liver via blood
    vessels

Large Intestine

The principal function of the large intestine is to absorb any remaining
water and mineral ions

-   The large intestine is divided into the ascending colon, transverse
    colon, descending colon, sigmoidal colon and rectum
-   The appendix is also considered a part of the large intestine
    although it is a vestigial remnant without an important function

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of tissue layers in transverse sections of the
small intestine viewed with a microscope or in aÂ 

Â  Â Â micrograph

Â  Â Â 
The human intestines function to absorb the products of digestion and
have specialised structures to fulfil this function

-   The small intestine absorbs usable food substances (i.e. nutrients
    â€“ monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, etc.)
-   The large intestine absorbs water and dissolved minerals (i.e. ions)
    from the indigestible food residues

Structure of the Small Intestine

The small intestine is composed of four main tissue layers, which are
(from outside to centre):

-   Serosa â€“ a protective outer covering composed of a layer of cells
    reinforced by fibrous connective tissue
-   Muscle layer â€“ outer layer of longitudinal muscle (peristalsis)
    and inner layer of circular muscle (segmentation)
-   Submucosa â€“ composed of connective tissue separating the muscle
    layer from the innermost mucosa
-   Mucosa â€“ a highly folded inner layer which absorbs material
    through its surface epithelium from the intestinal lumen

Below is a cross-section of the ileum â€“ the final section of the small
intestine (click on image to view coloured layers):

[My Image 1] [My Image 2]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Villi increase the surface area of epithelium over which
absorption is carried out

â€¢ Â Villi absorb monomers formed by digestion as well as mineral ions
and vitamins

Â  Â Â 
The inner epithelial lining of the intestine is highly folded into
finger-like projections called villi (singular: villus)

-   Many villi will protrude into the intestinal lumen, greatly
    increasing the available surface area for material absorption

Features of Villi

Intestinal villi contain several key features which facilitate the
absorption of digestive products (monomers, ions and vitamins):
[Mr Slim]

-   Microvilli â€“ Ruffling of epithelial membrane further increases
    surface area
-   Rich blood supply â€“ Dense capillary network rapidly transports
    absorbed products
-   Single layer epithelium â€“ Minimises diffusion distance between
    lumen and blood
-   Lacteals â€“ Absorbs lipids from the intestine into the lymphatic
    system
-   Intestinal glands â€“ Exocrine pits (crypts of Lieberkuhn) release
    digestive juices
-   Membrane proteins â€“ Facilitates transport of digested materials
    into epithelial cells

Mnemonic: Â MR SLIM

Features of Intestinal Villi

[features of villi]

Structure of Villus Epithelium

The epithelial lining of villi contains several structural features
which optimise its capacity to absorb digested materials:
Tight Junctions

-   Occluding associations between the plasma membrane of two adjacent
    cells, creating an impermeable barrier
-   They keep digestive fluids separated from tissues and maintain a
    concentration gradient by ensuring one-way movementÂ 

Microvilli

-   Microvilli borders significantly increase surface area of the plasma
    membrane (>100Ã—), allowing for more absorption to occur
-   The membrane will be embedded with immobilised digestive enzymes and
    channel proteins to assist in material uptakeÂ 

Mitochondria

-   Epithelial cells of intestinal villi will possess large numbers of
    mitochondria to provide ATP for active transport mechanisms
-   ATP may be required for primary active transport (against gradient),
    secondary active transport (co-transport) or pinocytosis

Pinocytotic Vesicles

-   Pinocytosis (â€˜cell-drinkingâ€™) is the non-specific uptake of
    fluids and dissolved solutes (a quick way to translocate in bulk)
-   These materials will be ingested via the breaking and reforming of
    the membrane and hence contained within a vesicle

Stages of Digestion

The main purpose of the digestive system is to break large molecules
down into smaller subunits due to the fact that:

-   Large molecules are typically chemically inert and need to be broken
    down and reassembled into usable products
-   Large molecules are typically insoluble and cannot be absorbed into
    cells, whereas smaller subunits are soluble

The process of digestion occurs across a number of stages, including:

-   Ingestion â€“ food is taken into the body via the act of eating
-   Digestion â€“ food is broken down both physically (e.g. mastication)
    and chemically (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis)
-   Absorption â€“ digested food products are absorbed into the
    bloodstream and transported to cells
-   Assimilation â€“ digested food products are converted into the fluid
    and solid parts of a cell / tissue
-   Elimination â€“ undigested food residues are egested from the body
    as semi-solid faeces

Starch Digestion

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Processes occurring in the small intestine that result in the
digestion of starch and transport of the products of

Â  Â Â digestion to the liver

Â  Â Â 
Starch is a polysaccharide composed of glucose monomers and accounts for
~ 60% of the carbohydrates consumed by humans

-   Starch can exist in one of two forms â€“ linear chains (amylose) or
    branched chains (amylopectin)

The digestion of starch is initiated by salivary amylase in the mouth
and continued by pancreatic amylase in the intestines

-   Starch digestion by amylase does not occur in the stomach as the pH
    is unsuitable for amylase activity (optimal pH ~ 7)

Amylase digests amylose into maltose subunits (disaccharide) and digests
amylopectin into branched chains called dextrins

-   Both maltose and dextrin are digested by enzymes (maltase) which are
    fixed to the epithelial lining of the small intestine
-   The hydrolysis of maltose / dextrin results in the formation of
    glucose monomers

Glucose can be hydrolysed to produce ATP (cell respiration) or stored in
animals as the polysaccharide glycogen

-   Glucose monomers can also be generated from the breakdown of other
    disaccharides (such as lactose and sucrose)

Overview of Starch Hydrolysis

[starch hydrolysis]

Role of Pancreas

The pancreas serves two functions in the breakdown of starch:

-   It produces the enzyme amylase which is released from exocrine
    glands (acinar cells) into the intestinal tract
-   It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon which are released
    from endocrine glands (islets of Langerhans) into the blood

The hormones insulin and glucagon regulate the concentration of glucose
in the bloodstream (controls availability to cells)

-   Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by increasing glycogen synthesis
    and storage in the liver and adipose tissues
-   Glucagon increases blood glucose levels by limiting the synthesis
    and storage of glycogen by the liver and adipose tissues

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Arteries convey blood at high pressure from the ventricles to the
tissues of the body

â€¢ Â Arteries have muscle cells and elastic fibres in their walls

Â  Â Â 
Structure and Function

The function of arteries is to convey blood at high pressureÂ from the
heart ventricles to the tissues of the body and lungs

To this end, arteries have a specialised structure in order to
accomplish this task:

-   They have a narrow lumen (relative to wall thickness) to maintain a
    high blood pressure (~ 80 â€“ 120 mmHg)
-   They have a thick wall containing an outer layer of collagen to
    prevent the artery from rupturing under the high pressure
-   The arterial wall also contains an inner layer of muscle and elastic
    fibres to help maintain pulse flow (it can contract and stretch)

Structure of a Typical Artery

[artery]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The muscle and elastic fibres assist in maintaining blood pressure
between pump cycles

Â  Â Â 
Flow of Blood

Blood is expelled from the heart upon ventricular contraction and flows
through the arteries in repeated surges called pulses

-   This blood flows at a high pressure and the muscle and elastic
    fibres assist in maintaining this pressure between pumps

The muscle fibres help to form a rigid arterial wall that is capable of
withstanding the high blood pressure without rupturing

-   Muscle fibres can also contract to narrow the lumen, which increases
    the pressure between pumps and helps to maintain blood pressure
    throughout the cardiac cycle

The elastic fibres allow the arterial wall to stretch and expand upon
the flow of a pulse through the lumen

-   The pressure exerted on the arterial wall is returned to the blood
    when the artery returns to its normal size (elastic recoil)
-   The elastic recoil helps to push the blood forward through the
    artery as well as maintain arterial pressure between pump cycles

Arterial Blood Flow

[arterial flow]

Â 
Blood Composition

Blood is the fluid medium in which materials are transported around the
body via bloodÂ vessels

-   An average adult human contains roughly 5 â€“ 6 litres of blood
    (approximately 77 mls per kilogram)

When blood is fractionated by centrifugation, three key elements become
apparent

-   Fractionated blood contains roughly 55% plasma, 45% red blood cells
    and less than 1% forms a buffy coat

Plasma

-   Consists mainly of water, which dissolves materials and functions as
    a transport medium
-   Contains electrolytes (minerals that carry a charge), which are
    important for maintaining fluid balance and blood pH
-   Proteins in the blood plasma maintain osmotic potential (albumin),
    transport lipids (globulin) and help clot (fibrinogen)
-   Blood plasma also functions to transport various materials needed by
    the body and wastes produced by body cells

Red Blood Cells

-   Red blood cells (erythrocytes) are responsible for transporting
    oxygen around the body
-   Oxygen is bound to haemoglobin at the lungs and released from the
    red blood cell at respiring body tissues

Buffy Coat

-   The buffy coat is the fraction of a blood sample that contains white
    blood cells and platelets
-   White blood cells (leukocytes) are involved in the bodyâ€™s immune
    defence (eliminating infections)
-   Platelets (thrombocytes) are involved in blood clotting (repairing
    damaged vessels to prevent blood loss)

Composition of Human Blood

[blood composition]

Composition of Blood Plasma

Various materials Â are transported in the plasma for use by the body,
including:

[nacho uh]

Nutrients â€“ needed by cells to make chemical energy (e.g. glucose)

Antibodies â€“ involved in pathogen identification and elimination

Carbon dioxide â€“ waste produced as a by-product of cell respiration

Hormones â€“ chemical messengers that move through the bloodstream

Oxygen â€“ required by body tissues in order to respire aerobically

Urea â€“ compound that is excreted to remove nitrogen from the body

Heat â€“ not a molecule, but still an important component of blood
plasma
Mnemonic: Â Nacho, Uh!
Blood Pressure

Blood pressure measurements include two readings â€“ a systolic pressure
and a diastolic pressure

-   The systolic pressure is a higher value that represents the pressure
    in the vessel when the heart is contracting (i.e. pulse flow)
-   The diastolic pressure is a lower value that represents the pressure
    in the vessel when the heart is relaxing

Blood pressure is measured in arteries using a sphygmomanometer (veins
do not have sufficient pressure to be easily detected)

-   The sphygmomanometer is a blood pressure cuff that cuts off
    circulation to a region (typically the brachial artery in the arm)
-   The pressure of the cuff is slowly released until a pulse can be
    audibly detected with a stethoscope (systolic pressure)Â 
-   The pressure continues to be released from the cuff until a pulse
    can no longer be audibly detected (diastolic pressure)
-   A normal blood pressure for a healthy adult is approximately 120 /
    80 mmHg

Capillaries

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Capillaries have permeable walls that allow exchange of material
between cells in tissues and blood in capillaries

Â  Â Â 
Structure and Function

The function of capillaries is to exchange materials between the cells
in tissues and blood travelling at low pressure (<10mmHg)

-   Arteries split into arterioles which in turn split into capillaries,
    decreasing arterial pressure as total vessel volume is increased
-   The branching of arteries into capillaries therefore ensures blood
    is moving slowly and all cells are located near a blood supply
-   After material exchange has occurred, capillaries will pool into
    venules which will in turn collate into larger veins

Capillaries have specialised structures in order to accomplish their
task of material exchange:

-   They have a very small diameter (~ 5 Âµm wide) which allows passage
    of only a single red blood cell at a time (optimal exchange)
-   The capillary wall is made of a single layer of cells to minimise
    the diffusion distance for permeable materials
-   They are surrounded by a basement membrane which is permeable to
    necessary materials
-   They may contain pores to further aid in the transport of materials
    between tissue fluid and blood

Capillaries structure may vary depending on its location in the body and
specific role:

-   The capillary wall may be continuous with endothelial cells held
    together by tight junctions to limit permeability of large molecules
-   In tissues specialised for absorption (e.g. intestines, kidneys),
    the capillary wall may be fenestrated (contains pores)
-   Some capillaries are sinusoidal and have open spaces between cells
    and be permeable to large molcules and cells (e.g. in liver)

Capillary Structure

[capillaries]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Blood flows through tissues in capillaries

Â  Â Â 
Flow of Blood

Blood flows through the capillaries very slowly and at a very low
pressure in order to allow for maximal material exchange

-   The high blood pressure in arteries is dissapated by extensive
    branching of the vessels and the narrowing of the lumen

The higher hydrostatic pressure at the arteriole end of the capillary
forces material from the bloodstream into the tissue fluid

-   Material that exits the capillaries at body tissues include oxygen
    and nutrients (needed by the cells for respiration)

The lower hydrostatic pressure at the venule end of the capillary allows
materials from the tissues to enter the bloodstream

-   Materials that enters the capillaries at body tissues include carbon
    dioxide and urea (wastes produced by the cells)

Application:

â€¢ Â Pressure changes in the left atrium, left ventricle and aorta
during the cardiac cycle

Â  Â Â 
The cardiac cycle describes the series of events that take place in the
heart over the duration of a single heart beat

-   It is comprised of a period of contraction (systole) and relaxation
    (diastole)

Systole

-   Blood returning to the heart will flow into the atria and ventricles
    as the pressure in them is lower (due to low volume of blood)
-   When ventricles are ~70% full, atria will contract (atrial systole),
    increasing pressure in the atria and forcing blood into ventricles
-   As ventricles contract, ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure
    and AV valves close to preventÂ back flow (first heart sound)
-   With both sets of heart valves closed, pressure rapidly builds in
    the contracting ventricles (isovolumetric contraction)
-   When ventricular pressure exceeds blood pressure in the aorta, the
    aortic valve opens and blood is released into the aorta

Diastole

-   As blood exits the ventricle and travels down the aorta, ventricular
    pressure fallsÂ 
-   When ventricular pressure drops below aortic pressure, the aortic
    valve closes to preventÂ back flow (second heart sound)
-   When the ventricular pressure drops below the atrial pressure, the
    AV valve opens and blood can flow from atria to ventricle
-   Throughout the cycle, aortic pressure remains quite high as muscle
    and elastic fibres in the artery wall maintain blood pressure

Application:

â€¢ Â William Harveyâ€™s discovery of the circulation of blood with the
heart acting as a pump

Â  Â Â 
Our modern understanding of circulatory system is based upon the
discoveries of 17^(th) century English physician, William Harvey

-   Harveyâ€™s findings were published in a book commonly called De Motu
    Cordis â€“ On the Motion of the Heart and Blood

Prior to Harveyâ€™s findings, scientists held to the antiquated views of
the Greek philosopher Galen, who believed that:

-   Arteries and veins were separate blood networks (except where they
    connected via invisible pores)
-   Veins were thought to pump natural blood (which was believed to be
    produced by the liver)
-   Arteries were thought to pump heat (produced by the heart) via the
    lungs (for cooling â€“ like bellows)

Based on some simple experiments and observations, Harvey instead
proposed that:

-   Arteries and veins were part of a single connected blood network (he
    did not predict the existence of capillaries however)
-   Arteries pumped blood from the heart (to the lungs and body tissues)
-   Veins returned blood to the heart (from the lungs and body tissues)

Circulation According to William Harvey

[Harvey circulation]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â There is a separate circulation for the lungs

Â  Â Â 
The human heart is a four chambered organ, consisting of two atria and
two ventricles

-   The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart
    is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles)
-   The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at
    high pressure via arteries

The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because
there are two distinct locations for blood transport

-   The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body
    (systemic circulation)
-   The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs
    (pulmonary circulation)

There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of
heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart)

-   The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall
    (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further

Overview of Pulmonary and Systemic Circulation

[systemic circulation]
Electrocardiography

Heart function can be diagnostically assessed by measuring the
electrical activity of the heart with each contraction

-   Activity is measured using a machine called an electrocardiograph to
    generate data called an electrocardiogram
    -   Hint: Â In a similar fashion, you use aÂ telegraph (machine) to
        send a telegram (data)

Each normal heart beat should follow the same sequence of electrical
events:

-   The P wave represents depolarisation of the atria in response to
    signalling from the sinoatrial node (i.e. atrial contraction)
-   The QRS complex represents depolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular contraction), triggered by signals from the AV node
-   The T wave represents repolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular relaxation) and the completion of a standard heart beat
-   Between these periods of electrical activity are intervals allowing
    for blood flow (PR interval and ST segment)

Electrical Activity of the Heart

[ECG]

Examples of Heart Conditions

Data generated via electrocardiography can be used to identify a variety
of heart conditions, including:

-   Tachycardia (elevated resting heart rate = >120Â bpm) and
    bradycardia (depressed resting heart rate = < 40 bpm)
-   Arrhythmias (irregular heart beats that are so common in young
    people that it is not technically considered a disease)
-   Fibrillations (unsynchronised contractions of either atria or
    ventricles leading to dangerously spasmodic heart activity)

Heart Beat

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The heart beat is initiated by a group of specialised muscle cells
in the right atrium called the sinoatrial node

â€¢ Â The sinoatrial node acts as a pacemaker

Â  Â Â 
The contraction of the heart is myogenic â€“ meaning that the signal for
cardiac compression arises within the heart tissue itself

-   In other words, the signal for a heart beat is initiated by the
    heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) rather than from brain signals

Within the wall of the right atrium are a specialised cluster of
cardiomyocytes which direct the contraction of heart muscle tissue

-   This cluster of cells are collectively called the sinoatrial node
    (SA node or SAN)

The sinoatrial node acts as the primary pacemaker â€“ controlling the
rate at which the heart beats (i.e. paceÂ â€˜makingâ€™)

-   The SA node triggers roughly 60 â€“ 100 cardiac contractions per
    minute (normal sinus rhythm)
-   If the SA node fails, a secondary pacemaker (AV node) may maintain
    cardiac contractions at roughly 40 â€“ 60 bpm
-   If both fail, a final tertiary pacemaker (Bundle of His) may
    coordinate contractions at a constant rate of roughly 30 â€“ 40Â bpm

The interference of the pacemakers will lead to the irregular and
uncoordinated contraction of the heart muscle (fibrillation)

-   When fibrillation occurs, normal sinus rhythm may be re-established
    with a controlled electrical current (defibrillation)

The Role of a Pacemaker

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The sinoatrial node sends out an electrical signal that stimulates
contraction as it is propagated through theÂ 

Â  Â Â walls of the atria and then the walls of the ventricles

Â  Â Â 
The electrical conduction of a heart beat occurs according to the
following events:

-   The sinoatrial node sends out an electrical impulse that stimulates
    contraction of the myocardium (heart muscle tissue)
-   This impulse directly causes the atria to contract and stimulates
    another node at the junction between the atrium and ventricle
-   This second node â€“ the atrioventricular node (AV node) â€“ sends
    signals down the septum via a nerve bundle (Bundle of His)
-   The Bundle of His innervates nerve fibres (Purkinje fibres) in the
    ventricular wall, causing ventricular contraction

This sequence of events ensures there is a delay between atrial and
ventricular contractions, resulting in two heart sounds

-   This delay allows time for the ventricles to fill with blood
    following atrial contractions so as to maximise blood flow

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of occlusion of the coronary arteries

Â  Â Â 
Blood pumped through the heart is at high pressure and cannot be used to
supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients

-   Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that surround the heart and
    nourish the cardiac tissue to keep the heart working
-   If coronary arteries become occluded, the region of heart tissue
    nourished by the blocked artery will die and cease to function

Causes of Coronary Occlusion

Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries due to
the deposition of cholesterol

-   Atheromas (fatty deposits) develop in the arteries and significantly
    reduce the diameter of the lumen (stenosis)
-   The restricted blood flow increases pressure in the artery, leading
    to damage to the arterial wall (from shear stress)
-   The damaged region is repaired with fibrous tissue which
    significantly reduces the elasticity of the vessel wall
-   As the smooth lining of the artery is progressively degraded,
    lesions form called atherosclerotic plaques
-   If the plaque ruptures, blood clotting is triggered, forming a
    thrombus that restricts blood flow
-   If the thrombus is dislodged it becomes an embolus and can cause a
    blockage in a smaller arteriole

[coronary plaque]

Consequences of Coronary Occlusion

Atherosclerosis can lead to blood clots which cause coronary heart
disease when they occur in coronary arteries

-   Myocardial tissue requires the oxygen and nutrients transported via
    the coronary arteries in order to function
-   If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked, an acute myocardial
    infarction (heart attack) will result
-   Blockages of coronary arteries are typically treated by by-pass
    surgery or creating a stent (e.g. balloonÂ angioplasty)

[goddess]

Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease

There are several risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD),
including:

-   Age â€“ Blood vessels become less flexible with advancing age
-   Genetics â€“ Having hypertension predispose individuals to
    developing CHDÂ 
-   Obesity â€“ Being overweight places an additional strain on the
    heart
-   Diseases â€“ Certain diseases increase the risk of CHD (e.g.
    diabetes)
-   Diet â€“ Diets rich in saturated fats, salts and alcohol increases
    the risk
-   Exercise â€“ Sedentary lifestyles increase the risk of developing
    CHD
-   Sex â€“ Males are at a greater risk due to lower oestrogen levels
-   Smoking â€“ Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, raising blood pressure

Heart Rate

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The heart rate can be increased or decreased by impulses brought
to the heart through two nerves from theÂ 

Â  Â Â medulla of the brain

Â  Â Â 
While the basal heart rate is determined within the heart by the
pacemaker, it can be regulated by external signals

-   Nerve signals from the brain can trigger rapid changes, while
    endocrine signals can trigger more sustained changes
-   Changes to blood pressure levels or CO₂ concentrations (and thereby
    blood pH) will trigger changes in heart rate

Nerve Signalling

The pacemaker is under autonomic (involuntary) control from the brain,
specifically the medulla oblongata (brain stem)

Two nerves connected to the medulla regulate heart rate by either
speeding it up or slowing it down:

-   The sympathetic nerve releases the neurotransmitter noradrenaline
    (a.k.a. norepinephrine) to increase heart rate
-   The parasympathetic nerve (vagus nerve) releases the
    neurotransmitter acetylcholine to decrease heart rate

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Epinephrine increases the heart rate to prepare for vigorous
physical activity

Â  Â Â 
Hormonal Signalling

Hormones are chemical messengers released into the bloodstream that act
specifically on distant target sites (like the heart)

Heart rate can undergo a sustained increase in response to hormonal
signalling in order to prepare for vigorous physical activity

-   The hormone adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) is released from the
    adrenal glands (located above the kidneys)
-   Adrenaline increases heart rate by activating the same chemical
    pathways as the neurotransmitter noradrenaline

Diagram of a Human Heart

Heart Structure

The structure of the human heart includes the following key components:
Chambers

-   Two atria (singular = atrium) â€“ smaller chambers near top of heart
    that collect blood from body and lungs
-   Two ventricles â€“ larger chambers near bottom of heart that pump
    blood to body and lungs

Heart Valves

-   Atrioventricular valves (between atria and ventricles) â€“ bicuspid
    valve on left side ; tricuspid valve on right side
-   Semilunar valves (between ventricles and arteries) â€“ aortic valve
    on left side ; pulmonary valve on right side

Blood Vessels

-   Vena cava (inferior and superior) feeds into the right atrium and
    returns deoxygenated blood from the body
-   Pulmonary artery connects to the right ventricle and sends
    deoxygenated blood to the lungs
-   Pulmonary vein feeds into the left atrium and returns oxygenated
    blood from the lungs
-   Aorta extends from the left ventricle and sends oxygenated blood
    around the body

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Veins collect blood at low pressure from the tissues of the body
and return it to the atria of the heart

Â  Â Â 
Structure and Function

The function of veins is to collect the blood from the tissues and
convey it at low pressure to the atria of the heart

To this end, veins have a specialised structure in order to accomplish
this task:

-   They have a very wide lumen (relative to wall thickness) to maximise
    blood flow for more effective return
-   They have a thin wall containing less muscle and elastic fibres as
    blood is flowing at a very low pressure (~ 5 â€“ 10 mmHg)
-   Because the pressure is low, veins possess valves to prevent
    backflow and stop the blood from pooling at the lowest extremities

Structure of a Typical Vein

[vein]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Valves in veins and the heart ensure circulation of blood by
preventingÂ backflow

Â  Â Â 
Flow of Blood

Blood is at very low pressure in the veins which can make it difficult
for the blood to move against the downward force of gravity

-   The veins contain numerous one-way valves in order to maintain the
    circulation of blood by preventingÂ backflow

Veins typically pass between skeletal muscle groups, which facilitate
venous blood flow via periodic contractions

-   When the skeletal muscles contract, they squeeze the vein and cause
    the blood to flow from the site of compression
-   Veins typically run parallel to arteries, and a similar effect can
    be caused by the rhythmic arterial bulge created by a pulse

Â  Â Â 
The difference in the structural characteristics of arteries,

    blood at high pressure
-   Capillaries have walls that are only a single cell thick because
    they exchange materials between blood and tissue
-   Veins have thin walls with wide lumens and valves because they
    transport blood at low pressure

Identification of Blood Vessels

Blood vessels can be identified from histological slides or images
according to the thickness of their walls:

-   Arteries have thick walls composed of three distinct layers (tunica)
-   Veins have thin walls but typically have wider lumen (lumen size may
    vary depending on specific artery or vein)
-   Capillaries are very small and will not be easily detected under the

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Antibiotics block processes that occur in prokaryotic cells but
not in eukaryotic cells

â€¢ Â Viruses lack a metabolism and cannot therefore be treated with
antibiotics

Â  Â Â 
Antibiotics are compounds that kill or inhibit the growth of microbes
(specifically bacteria) by targeting prokaryotic metabolism

-   Metabolic features that may be targeted by antibiotics include key
    enzymes, 70S ribosomes and components of the cell wall
-   Because eukaryotic cells do not possess these features, antibiotics
    will target the pathogenic bacteria and not the infected host
-   Antibiotics may either kill the invading bacteria (bactericidal) or
    suppress its potential to reproduce (bacteriostatic)

Viruses do not possess a metabolism (they are not alive) and instead
take over the cellular machinery of infected host cells

-   As such, they cannot be treated with antibiotics and must instead be
    treated with specific antiviral agents
-   Antiviral treatments target features specific to viruses (e.g. viral
    enzymes like reverse transcriptase or components of the capsid)

Antibiotic Targets in a Typical Prokaryote

[antibiotics]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some strains of bacteria have evolved with genes that confer
resistance to antibiotics and some strains of Â 

Â  Â Â bacteria have multiple resistance

Â  Â Â 
Since the discovery of the first antibiotic in 1928, antibiotic
compounds have been used to treat a variety of bacterial infections

-   Antibiotics can be narrow spectrum (effective against specific
    bacteria) or broad spectrum (effective against many bacteria)

Some strains of bacteria have evolved with genes that confer resistance
to antibiotics and some strains have multiple resistance

-   Genes may confer resistance by encoding traits that degrade the
    antibiotic, block its entry, increase its removal or alter the
    target
-   Because bacteria reproduce at a rapid rate, resistant strains of
    bacteria can proliferate very quickly following the initial mutation
-   Additionally, resistant strains can pass resistance genes to
    susceptible strains via bacterial conjugation (horizontal gene
    transfer)

The prevalance of resistant bacterial strains is increasing rapidly with
human populations due to a number of factors:

-   Antibiotics are often over-prescribed (particularly broad-spectrum
    drugs) or misused (e.g. given to treat a viral infection)
-   Many antibiotics are freely available without a prescription and
    certain antibiotics are commonly included in livestock feed
-   Multi-drug resistant bacteria are especially common in hospitals
    (i.e. nosocomial infections) where antibiotic use is high

An example of an antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria is Golden Staph
(MRSA â€“ Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cuts in the skin are sealed by blood clotting

Â  Â Â 
Blood Clots

Clotting (haemostasis) is the mechanism by which broken blood vessels
are repaired when damaged

-   Clotting functions to prevent blood loss from the body and limit
    pathogenic access to the bloodstream when the skin is broken

There are two key components of a blood clot â€“ platelets and insoluble
fibrin strands

-   Platelets undergo a structural change when activated to form a
    sticky plug at the damaged region (primaryÂ haemostasis)
-   Fibrin strands form an insoluble mesh of fibres that trap blood
    cells at the site of damage (secondaryÂ haemostasis)

[blood clot]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Clotting factors are released from platelets

â€¢ Â The cascade results in the rapid conversion of fibrinogen to
fibrin by thrombin

Â  Â Â 
Coagulation Cascade

The process by which blood clots are formed involves a complex set of
reactions collectively called the coagulation cascade

-   This cascade is stimulated by clotting factors released from damaged
    cells (extrinsic pathway) and platelets (intrinsic pathway)

The coagulation cascade involves many intermediary steps, however the
principal events are as follows:

-   Clotting factors cause platelets to become sticky and adhere to the
    damaged region to form a solid plug
-   These factors also initiate localised vasoconstriction to reduce
    blood flow through the damaged region
-   Additionally, clotting factors trigger the conversion of the
    inactive zymogen prothrombin into the activated enzyme thrombin
-   Thrombin in turn catalyses the conversion of the soluble plasma
    protein fibrinogen into an insolube fibrous form called fibrin
-   The fibrin strands form a mesh of fibres around the platelet plug
    and traps blood cells to form a temporary clot
-   When the damaged region is completely repaired, an enzyme (plasmin)
    is activated to dissolve the clot

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of blood clot formation in coronary
arteries

Â  Â Â 
Coronary Thrombosis

Coronary thrombosis is the formation of a clot within the blood vessels
that supply and sustain the heart tissue (coronaryÂ arteries)

-   Occlusion of a coronary artery by a blood clot may lead to an acute
    myocardial infarction (heart attack)

Blood clots form in coronary arteries when the vessels are damaged as a
result of theÂ deposition ofÂ cholesterol (atherosclerosis)

-   AtheromasÂ (fatty deposits) develop in the arteries and
    significantly reduce the diameter of the lumen (stenosis)
-   The restricted blood flow increases pressure in the artery, leading
    to damage to the arterial wall (from shear stress)
-   The damaged region is repaired with fibrous tissue which
    significantly reduces the elasticity of the vessel wall
-   As the smooth lining of the artery is progressively degraded,
    lesions form calledÂ atherosclerotic plaques
-   If the plaque ruptures, blood clotting is triggered, forming
    aÂ thrombusÂ that restricts blood flow
-   If the thrombus is dislodged it becomes anÂ embolusÂ and can cause a
    blockage in a smaller arteriole

Causes and Consequences of Coronary Thrombosis

[coronary thrombosis]
Haemophilia

Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive condition that impairs the bodyâ€™s
ability to control blood clotting

-   It is more common in males than females (as males areÂ hemizygous
    and have only one X chromosome)

People with haemophilia (haemophiliacs) have lower levels of functional
clotting factors in their blood plasma

-   This means the normal coagulation cascade is impaired and fibrin
    formation does not occur
-   Thus while a temporary scab may form (due to the formation of a
    platelet plug), a lasting blood clot cannot form

Haemophiliacs can die from minor injuries, as the continued loss of
blood flow cannot be prevented via clot formation

-   There are different types of haemophilia with varying severities,
    depending on which specific clotting factor is defective
-   Haemophilia A (clotting factor XIII deficiency) is more common than
    haemophilia B (clotting factor IX deficiency)

helper T cells, disabling the bodyâ€™s adaptive immune system

-   It causes a variety of symptoms and infections collectively classed
    as Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

Effects of HIV

-   HIV specifically targets the helper T lymphocytes which regulate the
    adaptive immune system
-   Following infection, the virus undergoes a period of inactivity
    (clinical latency) during which infected helper T cells reproduce
-   Eventually, the virus becomes active again and begins to spread,
    destroying the T lymphocytes in the process (lysogenic cycle)
-   With a reduction in the number of helper T cells, antibodies are
    unable to be produced, resulting in a lowered immunity
-   The body becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections, eventually
    resulting in death if the condition is not managed

Progression of AIDS

Transmission of HIV

-   HIV is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids (including
    unprotected sex, blood transfusions, breastfeeding, etc.)
-   The risk of exposure to HIV through sexual contact can be minimised
    by using latex protection (i.e. condoms)
-   A small minority of people are immune to HIV infection (they lack
    the CD4+ receptor on T_(H) cells that HIV requires for docking)

Understandings:

-   The skin and mucous membranes form a primary defence against
    pathogens that cause infectious disease
-   Cuts in the skin are sealed by blood clotting
-   Clotting factors are released from platelets
-   The cascade results in the rapid conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin

    pathogens gives specific immunity
-   Antibiotics block processes that occur in prokaryotic cells but not
    in eukaryotic cells
-   Viruses lack a metabolism and cannot therefore be treated with
    antibiotics
-   Some strains of bacteria have evolved with genes that confer
    resistance to antibiotics and some strains of bacteria have multiple
    resistance

Immunity Analogy

Imagine that the human body is like a country and the cells are the
individual people that live in the country

-   Groups of cells may form organs, just like people may form societal
    groups like sporting clubs or occupations

Pathogens are foreign bodies that cause disease, similar to the way in
which criminals cause mayhem and damage

-   Pathogens can either cause damage endogenously (i.e. attack from
    abroad) or exogenously (i.e. attack from within)

The immune system is the bodyâ€™s defence force and is comprised of
three distinct levels of defenceÂ 

-   The first line of defence are surface barriers which function like
    physical borders (walls, moats, oceans) to keep criminals out
-   The second line of defence is the innate immune system, which is
    akin to the nationâ€™s standard police force
-   The third line of defence is the adaptive immune system, which is
    akin to a nationâ€™s special forces (army, super heroes, etc.)

Both the innate and adaptive immunity fight off infection concurrently,
however there are key differences between the two:

-   The innate immune system is quick to respond but is non-specific
    (just like police are first on the scene but lack special training)
-   The adaptive immune system is slower to respond but is specific
    (special forces take longer to mobilise but are better trained)
-   The innate immune system present antigens (information about
    specific pathogens) to the adaptive immune system
-   Based on the antigens (information) presented, appropriate
    antibodies (weapons) are made to combat the threat

[immune-analogy]
Inflammation

The inflammatory response is the non-specific way in which the body
responds when a pathogen damages body tissue

-   When tissue damage occurs, mast cells (localised) and basophils
    (circulating) release a chemical called histamine
-   Histamine causes local vasodilation and increases capillary
    permeability to improve the recruitment of leukocytes to the region
-   Damaged cells also release chemotactic factors which attract
    leukocytes to the site of infection
-   While inflammation is necessary to allow immune cells access to
    damaged tissue, there are unavoidable side effects
-   Increased blood flow causes redness and heat, while increased
    permeability releases fluids and causes swelling and tenderness
-   Inflammation can be either short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic)

Inflammatory Response

[inflammation]

Fever

A fever is an abnormally high temperature associated with infection and
is triggered by the release of prostaglandins

-   Fever may help to combat infection by reducing the growth rate of
    microbes (via the inactivation of microbial enzymes)
-   It may also increase metabolic activity in body cells and activate
    heat shock proteins to strengthen the immune response

A fever occurs when activated leukocytes release pro-inflammatory
chemicals called cytokines

-   Cytokines stimulate the anterior hypothalamus to produce
    prostaglandins, which lead to an increase in body temperature
-   Up to a certain point a fever may be beneficial, butÂ beyond a
    tolerable limit it can cause damage to the bodyâ€™s own enzymes

Mechanism of Fever

[fever]
Lines of Defense

The immune system can be divided into three basic lines of defense
against pathogenic infection:

-   The first line of defense against infection are the surface barriers
    that prevent the entry of pathogens into the body
-   The second line of defense are the non-specific phagocytes and other
    internal mechanisms that comprise innate immunity
-   The third line of defense are the specific lymphocytes that produce
    antibodies as part of the adaptive immune response

The Immune System: Three Lines of Defense

[lines of defence]

First Line of Defense

-   The primary defence against infectious disease are the surface
    barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body
-   These surface barriers include intact skin (protect external
    boundaries) and mucous membranes (protect internal boundaries)
-   Both the skin and mucous membranes release chemical secretions which
    restrict the growth of microbes on their surfaces
-   If pathogens cannot enter the host body, they cannot disrupt normal
    physiological functions and cause disease

Second Line of Defense

-   The second line of defence against infection are the non-specific
    cellular and molecular responses of the innate immune system
-   These defences do not differentiate between different types of
    pathogen and respond the same way upon every infection
-   Phagocytic leukocytes migrate to infection sites and engulf foreign
    bodies (dendritic cells then present antigens to lymphocytes)
-   Inflammatory responses increase capillary permeability at infected
    sites, recruiting leukocytes but leading to localised swelling
-   Antimicrobial proteins (such as cytokines and complement proteins)
    regulate immune activity within the body
-   Fever increases body temperatures to activate heat-shock proteins
    and suppress microbial growth and propagation

Third Line of Defense

-   The final line of defence against infection are the lymphocytes that
    produce antibodies to specific antigenic fragments
-   Each B cell produces a specific antibody, and the body has millions
    of different B cells capable ofÂ detecting distinct antigens
-   Helper T cells regulate B cell activation, ensuring that antibodies
    are only mass-produced at the appropriate times
-   Both B and T cells will differentiate to form memory cells after
    activation, conferring long-term immunity to a particular pathogen
Lymphocytes

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Production of antibodies by lymphocytes in response to particular
pathogens gives specific immunity

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ third line of defenceÂ against infectious disease is the
adaptiveÂ immune system, which isÂ specificÂ in its response

-   It can differentiate between particular pathogens and target a
    response that is specific to a given pathogen
-   It can respond rapidly upon re-exposure to a specific pathogen,
    preventing symptoms from developing (immunological memory)

Lymphocytes

The adaptive immune system is coordinated by lymphocytes (a class of
leukocyte) and results in the production of antibodies

-   B lymphocytes (B cells) are antibody-producing cells that recognise
    and target a particular pathogen fragment (antigen)
-   HelperÂ TÂ lymphocytesÂ (T_(H)Â cells) are regulator cells that
    release chemicals (cytokines) to activate specific B lymphocytes

When phagocytic leukocytes engulf a pathogen, some will present the
digested fragments (antigens) on their surface

-   These antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells) migrate to the
    lymph nodes and activate specific helper T lymphocytes
-   The helper T cells then release cytokines to activate the particular
    B cell capable of producing antibodies specific to the antigen
-   The activated B cell will divide and differentiate to form
    short-lived plasma cells that produce high amounts of specific
    antibody
-   Antibodies will target their specific antigen, enhancing the
    capacity of the immune system to recognise and destroy the pathogen
-   A small proportion of activated B cell (and activated T_(H) cell)
    will develop into memory cells to provide long-lasting immunity

Activation of the Adaptive Immune System

[antigen presentation]

Antibodies

Antigen: Â An antigen is a substance that the body recognises as foreign
and that will elicit an immune response

Antibody: Â An antibody is a protein produced by B lymphocytes (and
plasma cells) that is specific to a given antigen

-   Antibodies are made of 4 polypeptide chains that are joined together
    by disulphide bonds to form Y-shaped molecules
-   The ends of the arms are where the antigen binds â€“ these areas are
    called the variable regions and differ between antibodies
-   The rest of the molecule is constant across all antibodies and
    serves as a recognition site for the immune system (opsonisation)
-   Each type of antibody recognises a unique antigen, making
    antigen-antibody interactions specific (like enzymes and substrates)

Antigen-Antibody Specificity

[antigen-antibody]
Pathogens

A pathogen is a disease causing agent that disrupts the normal
physiology of the infected organism

-   Pathogens can be cellular (e.g. parasites, protozoa, bacteria) or
    acellular (viruses and prions)

Types of Pathogens

[pathogens]

Viruses

-   Viruses are metabolically inert and incapable of reproducing
    independently of a host cell (hence are non-living)
-   They typically consist of an inner core of nucleic acid surrounded
    by a protein coat (capsid)
-   Simpler viruses may lack a capsid (viroids), whilst more complex
    viruses may possess an external lipid envelope
-   Viruses can be either DNA-based (adenoviruses) or RNA-based
    (retroviruses)

Prions

-   A prion is an infectious protein that has folded abnormally into a
    structure capable of causing disease
-   Prions can cause normally folded proteins to refold into the
    abnormal form and hence propagate within a host body
-   Prion proteins aggregate together to form amyloid fibres that cause
    holes to form in the brain (spongiform encephalopathy)
-   Infectious prion proteins have a higher beta-sheet content, making
    them more resistant to denaturation and difficult to treat

Bacteria

-   Bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic cells that can reproduce
    quickly and compete with host cells for space and nutrition
-   Most bacteria are relatively harmless and some may even form
    mutualistic relationships with hosts (e.g. normal gut flora)
-   Bacteria may cause disease by producing toxic compounds (exotoxins)
    or releasing the substances when destroyed (endotoxins)
-   As the toxins retain their destructive capacity beyond bacterial
    death, they are often the cause of food poisoning

Fungi

-   Disease-causing fungi usually attack the body surfaces, including
    the skin and mucous membranes
-   They can be categorised according to whether they are unicellular
    (yeasts) or multicellular (moulds) â€“ most fungi are moulds
-   Moulds consist of branching filaments called hyphae, which may form
    a mass of invading threads called mycelium
-   Examples of fungal infections include thrush (yeast infection) and
    athleteâ€™s foot (mould infection)

Parasites

-   A parasite is an organism that grows and feeds on an organism to the
    detriment of the hostâ€™s survival
-   Parasites can be classed as either ectoparasites (living on the
    surface of the host) or endoparasites (living within the host)
-   Endoparasites can include microparasites (e.g. single-cell protozoa)
    or macroparasites (multicellular helmithes)

Application:

â€¢ Â Florey and Chainâ€™s experiments to test penicillin on bacterial
infections in mice

Â  Â Â 
The first chemical compound found to have antibiotic properties was
penicillin, which was identified by Alexander Fleming in 1928

-   The discovery of penicillin was a fortuitous accident, resulting
    from the unintended contamination of a dish containing S. aureus
-   A Penicillium mould began to grow on the plate and a halo of
    inhibited bacterial growth was observed around the mould
-   Fleming concluded that the mould was releasing a
    substanceÂ (penicillin) that was killing the nearby bacteriaÂ 

The Discovery of Penicillin

[penicillin]

Medical Applications

The medical applications of penicillin as an antibiotic were
demonstrated by an Australian scientist, Sir Howard Florey, in 1940

-   Working with another scientist (Ernst Chain) and a team of
    researchers, Florey tested penicillin on infected mice
-   Eight mice were injected with hemolytic streptococci and four of
    these mice were subsequently injected with doses of penicillin
-   The untreated mice died of bacterial infection while those treated
    with penicillin all survived â€“ demonstrating its antibiotic
    potential

Florey and Chain Experiment

[florey experiment]

Historical Significance

In 1945, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and Alexander Fleming were
collectively awarded the Nobel Prize for MedicineÂ 

-   Following the chemical determination of penicillin structure in
    1945, several synthetic derivatives have since been created
-   These derivatives (including methicillin) offer many benefits
    including a broader spectrum, more stability and greater tolerance

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ingestion of pathogens by phagocytic white blood cells gives
non-specific immunity to disease

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ second line of defenceÂ against infectious disease is the innate
immune system, which is non-specific in its response

-   A principle component of this line of defence are phagocytic white
    blood cells that engulf and digest foreign bodies
-   Other components of the innate immune system include inflammation,
    fever and antimicrobial chemicals (complement proteins)

The innate immune system has two key properties:

-   It does not differentiate between different types of pathogens
    (non-specific)Â 
-   It responds to an infection the same way every time (non-adaptive)

Phagocytes

Phagocytosis is the process by which solid materials (such as pathogens)
are ingested by a cell (i.e. cellÂ â€˜eatingâ€™ via endocytosis)

-   Phagocytic leukocytes circulate in the blood and move into the body
    tissue (extravasation) in response to infection
-   Damaged tissues release chemicals (e.g. histamine) which draw white
    blood cells to the site of infection (via chemotaxis)
-   Pathogens are engulfed when cellular extensions (pseudopodia)
    surround the pathogen and then fuse to form an internal vesicle
-   The vesicle is then fused to a lysosome (forming a phagolysosome)
    and the pathogen is digested
-   Pathogen fragments (antigens) may be presented on the surface of the
    phagocyte in order to stimulate the third line of defence

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The skin and mucous membranes form a primary defence against
pathogens that cause infectious disease

Â  Â Â 
The first line of defence against infectious disease are the surface
barriersÂ that prevent the entry of pathogens into the body

-   These surface barriers include both the intact skin and mucous
    membranes

Skin

-   Protects external structures when intact (outer body areas)
-   Consists of a dry, thick and tough region composed predominantly of
    dead surface cells
-   Contains biochemical defence agents (sebaceous glands secrete
    chemicals and enzymes which inhibit microbial growth on skin)
-   The skin also secretes lactic acid and fatty acids to lower the pH
    (skin pH is roughly ~ 5.6 â€“ 6.4 depending on body region)

Mucous Membranes

-   Protects internal structures (i.e. externally accessible cavities
    and tubes â€“ such as the trachea, oesophagus and urethra)
-   Consists of a thin region of living surface cells that release
    fluids to wash away pathogens (mucus, saliva, tears, etc.)
-   Contains biochemical defence agents (secretions contain lysozyme
    which can destroy cell walls and cause cell lysis)
-   Mucous membranes may be ciliated to aid in the removal of pathogens
    (along with physical actions such as coughing / sneezing)

Overview of Physical and Chemical Surface Barriers

[surface barriers]
Types of Leukocytes

There are five distinct classes of leukocytes (white blood cells) that
coordinate to provide defence against infectious disease:
Neutrophils

-   Most abundant type of white blood cell and the first responder to
    microbial infection
-   They are unable to renew their lysosomes and die after having
    phagocytosed a few pathogens (forms the majority of pus)
-   Analogy: Â Standard police officer â€“ quick to respond to the
    situation, but lacks special training or skills and so dies rapidly

Eosinophils

-   Prominent at the sites of allergic reactions and parasitic
    infections (rare in blood but common at mucous membranes)
-   Do not phagocytose pathogens but instead release chemical products
    which perforate cell membranes
-   Consequently, they function as the primary response to large
    multicellular parasites (e.g. helminth infections)
-   Analogy: Â Fumigator â€“ specialised to deal with pests / parasites
    (e.g. helminths) by releasing chemical products

Basophil

-   Basophils are chiefly responsible for initiating inflammatory
    responses by releasing the chemicals histamine and heparin
-   Functionally they are similar to mast cells, however they circulate
    in the bloodstream whereas mast cells are localised
-   Because they promote inflammation, they are common contributors to
    allergic responses
-   Analogy: Â Fireman â€“ the leukocyte involved when a region
    isÂ inflamed (â€˜in flamesâ€™)

Monocyte

-   Monocytes are theÂ largest type of leukocyte and share phagocytosis
    duties with neutrophils
-   They are slower to respond than neutrophils but are longer lasting,
    as they can renew their lysosomes for continued digestion
-   Monocytes will differentiate into two types of cells in response to
    pathogenic infection â€“ macrophages and dendritic cells
-   Macrophages will remain in the tissue and phagocytose, whereas
    dendritic cells present antigen fragments to lymphocytes
-   Analogy: Â Riot police (macrophage) â€“ slower to respond than
    standard police but better prepared and survives for longer
-   Analogy: Â Signalman (dendritic cell) â€“ identifies the pathogen
    and sends signals to the appropriate special forces (lymphocytes)

Lymphocyte

-   Lymphocytes are responsible for the production of antibodies which
    target specific antigens present on pathogens
-   They are more common in the lymphatic system than blood and are
    slowest to respond (requiring antigen presentation)
-   Lymphocytes include B cells (which become antibody-secreting plasma
    cells) and T cells (which mediate B cell activity)
-   Lymphocytes are also involved in the destruction of virus-infected
    body cells (via cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells)
-   Analogy: Â Special forces / superheroes â€“ takes longest to
    mobilise but specially trained to target specific pathogens

Prevalence of Leukocytes

[angry monkey]

The relative proportions of the different types of white blood cells
are:

â€¢ Neutrophils (roughly 60 â€“ 70%)

â€¢Â Lymphocytes (roughly 20 â€“ 30%)

â€¢Â Monocytes (approximately 1 â€“ 6%)

â€¢Â Eosinophils (approximately 1 â€“ 3%)

â€¢Â Basophils (less than 1%)

Effect of Exercise

While ventilation is driven by the need to expel carbon dioxide, the
uptake of oxygen is a vitally importantÂ corollary effect

-   Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration, by which large amounts
    of ATP areÂ produced (relative to anaerobic respiration)

When describing oxygen intake, the following terms are commonly used:

-   VO₂ â€“ The volume of oxygen absorbed by the body per minute and
    supplied to the tissues (i.e. oxygen consumption)
-   VO₂Â max â€“ The maximum rate at which oxygen can be absorbed and
    supplied to body tissues (i.e. maximum consumption)

At rest, the body does not consume the maximal amount of oxygen
available to the tissues (oxygen deficit)

-   As exercise intensity increases, the volume of oxygen supplied to
    the tissues also increases (up to the VO₂ max)
-   If energy demands exceedÂ oxygen intake, ATP may be produced via
    anaerobic respiration (producing lactic acid)
-   The lactic acid is transferred to the liver and requires oxygen to
    convert it back to a usable form (pyruvate)
-   This extra oxygen required to restore normal body functioning after
    exercise is referred to as the oxygen debt

The body requires more oxygen to generate a set amount of energy when
metabolising fats as compared to carbohydrates

-   This is why there is an increase in carbohydrate metabolism and a
    decrease in fat metabolism with higher intensity exercise

Oxygen Uptake During Steady-State Exercise

6.4 Â Gas Exchange

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The lungs are actively ventilatedÂ to ensure
that gas exchange can occur passively

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Ventilation maintains concentration gradients of oxygen and carbon
    dioxide between air in alveoli and blood flowing in adjacent
    capillaries
-   Air is carried to the lungs in the trachea and bronchi and then to
    the alveoli in bronchioles
-   Type I pneumocytes are extremely thin alveolar cells that are
    adapted to carry out gas exchange
-   Type II pneumocytes secrete a solution containing surfactant that
    creates a moist surface inside the alveoli to prevent the sides of
    the alveolus adhering to each other by reducing surface tension
-   Muscle contractions cause the pressure changes inside the thorax
    that force air in and out of the lungs to ventilate them
-   Different muscles are required for inspiration and expiration
    because muscles only do work when they contract

Applications:

-   Causes and consequences of lung cancer
-   Causes and consequences of emphysema
-   External and internal intercostal muscles, and diaphragm and
    abdominal muscles as examples of antagonistic muscle action

Skill:

-   Monitoring of ventilation in humans at rest and after mild and
    vigorous exercise
Lung Capacity

Lung capacities refer to the volumes of air associated with the
different phases of the respiratory cycle:

-   Total lung capacity â€“ Volume of air in the lungs after a maximal
    inhalation (~ 6 litres in a normal adult male)
-   Vital capacity â€“ Volume of air that can be exchanged by the lungs
    via a maximal inhalation and exhalation
-   Residual volume â€“ Volume of air that is always present in the
    lungs (~ 20% of total lung capacity)
-   Tidal volume â€“ Volume of air that is exchanged via normal
    breathing (~ 500 ml per breath)

Ventilation rate (breathing frequency) at rest for a typical adult is
roughly 12 â€“ 16 breaths per minute

-   Ventilation rate can be substantially increased with physical
    activity (maximal increase is roughly 5 â€“ 6 fold over normal)

A number of factors contribute to an individualâ€™s total lung capacity
and ventilation rate, including:

-   Height (taller people tend to have larger chests and hence larger
    total lung capacities)
-   Location (people living at high altitudes tend to have larger
    capacities to compensate for the lower atmospheric pressure)
-   Lifestyle (obese people and smokers tend to have lower capacities
    and higher rates of ventilation)

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of lung cancer

Â  Â Â 
Lung cancer describes the uncontrolled proliferation of lung cells,
leading to the abnormal growth of lung tissue (tumour)

-   The abnormal growth can impact on normal tissue function, leading to
    a variety of symptoms according to size and location
-   The tumours can remain in place (benign) or spread to other regions
    of the body (malignant)

Lung cancers are the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide
for two main reasons:

-   The lungs are vital to normal body function and thus the abrogation
    of their normal function is particularly detrimental to health
-   The lungs possess a very rich blood supply, increasing the
    likelihood of the cancer spreading (metastasis) to other body
    regions

The common symptoms of lung cancers include coughing up blood, wheezing,
respiratory distress and weight loss

-   If the cancer mass compresses adjacent organs it can cause chest
    pain, difficulty swallowing and heart complications

There are many causes for lung cancer, including smoking, asbestos, air
pollution, certain infections and genetic predispositions

Common Risk Factors for Lung Cancer

[lung cancer causes]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of emphysema

Â  Â Â 
Emphysema is a lung condition whereby the walls of the alveoli lose
their elasticity due to damage to the alveolar walls

-   The loss of elasticity results in the abnormal enlargement of the
    alveoli, leading to a lower total surface area for gas exchange
-   The degradation of the alveolar walls can cause holes to develop and
    alveoli to merge into huge air spaces (pulmonaryÂ bullae)

The major cause of emphysema is smoking, as the chemical irritants in
cigarette smoke damage the alveolar walls

-   The damage to lung tissue leads to the recruitment of phagocytes to
    the region, which produce an enzyme called elastase
-   This elastase, released as part of an inflammatory response, breaks
    down the elastic fibres in the alveolar wall
-   Elastase activity can be blocked by an enzyme inhibitor
    (Î±-1-antitrypsin), but not when elastase concentrations are
    increasedÂ 
-   A small proportion of emphysema cases are due to a hereditary
    deficiency in this enzyme inhibitor due to a gene mutation

Common symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath, phlegm
production, expansion of the ribcage, cyanosis and an increased
susceptibility to chest infections

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Air is carried to the lungs in the trachea and bronchi and then to
the alveoli in bronchioles

Â  Â Â 
The Respiratory System

-   Air enters the respiratory system through the nose or mouth and
    passes through the pharynx to the trachea
-   The air travels down the trachea until it divides into two bronchi
    (singular: bronchus) which connect to the lungs
-   The right lung is composed of three lobes, while the left lung is
    only comprised of two (smaller due to position of heart)
-   Inside each lung, the bronchi divide into many smaller airways
    called bronchioles, greatly increasing surface area
-   Each bronchiole terminates with a cluster of air sacs called
    alveoli, where gas exchange with the bloodstream occurs

Structure of the Lungs

â‡’Â Â Click on the diagram to show / hide labels

Structure of an Alveolus

Alveoli function as the site of gas exchange, and hence have specialised
structural features to help fulfil this role:

-   They have a very thin epithelial layer (one cell thick) to minimise
    diffusion distances for respiratory gases
-   They are surrounded by a rich capillary network to increase the
    capacity for gas exchange with the blood
-   They are roughly spherical in shape, in order to maximise the
    available surface area for gas exchange
-   Their internal surface is covered with a layer of fluid, as
    dissolved gases are better able to diffuse into the bloodstream

Mechanism of Breathing

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Muscle contractions cause the pressure changes inside the thorax
that forces air in and out of the lungs

Â  Â Â 
Breathing is the active movement of respiratory muscles that enables the
passage of air into and out of the lungs

-   The contraction of respiratory muscles changes the volume of the
    thoracic cavity (i.e. the chest)

The mechanism of breathing occurs according to the principle of
Boyleâ€™s Law (pressure is inversely proportional to volume)

-   When the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, pressure in the
    thorax decreases
-   When the volume of the thoracic cavity decreases, pressure in the
    thorax increases

Gases will move from a region of high pressure to a region of lower
pressure (similar to movement via concentration gradient)

-   When the pressure in the chest is less than the atmospheric
    pressure, air will move into the lungs (inspiration)
-   When the pressure in the chest is greater than the atmospheric
    pressure, air will move out of the lungs (expiration)

Principle Behind Negative Pressure Breathing

[boyles law]

Â 

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Different muscles are required for inspiration and expiration
because muscles only do work when they contract

Â  Â Â 
Respiratory muscles contract to change the volume of the thoracic cavity
and hence alter the pressure in the chest

-   Because muscles only do work via contraction, different groups of
    muscles are required to expand and contract chest volume

Changing chest volume creates a pressure differential between the chest
and atmosphere â€“ with air then moving to equalise

-   Muscles that increase the volume of the chest cause inspiration (as
    chest pressure is less than atmospheric pressure)
-   Muscles the decrease the volume of the chest cause expiration (as
    chest pressure is greater than atmosphericÂ pressure)

Atmospheric pressure is lower at high altitudes, meaning a greater
increase in chest volume is required before a pressure differential is
formed â€“ making it harder to breathe at high altitudes

-   The body will adapt mechanisms to improve oxygen uptake under these
    conditions, which is why athletes will often undertake high altitude
    training prior to competitions

Asthma

Asthma is a common, chronic inflammation of the airways to the lungs
(i.e. bronchi and bronchioles)

-   Inflammation leads to swelling and mucus production, resulting in
    reduced airflow andÂ bronchospasm
-   During an acute asthma attack, constriction of the bronchi smooth
    muscle may cause significant airflow obstruction
-   Common symptoms of an asthma attack include shortness of breath,
    chest tightness, wheezing and coughing
-   Severe cases of asthma may be life threatening if left untreated

Asthma may be caused by a number of variable and recurring environmental
triggers, including allergens, smoke, cold air, certain medications and
arthropods (e.g. dust mites)

Physiology of an Asthma Attack

[asthma]

Pneumothorax

A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of gas in the pleural space
that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall

-   The pleural cavity is a thin, fluid-filled space between the lung
    and chest wall
-   Surface tension of the pleural fluid causes the lung to adhere
    closely to the chest wall and thus inflate upon chest expansion
-   If this cavity becomes filled with air (pneumothorax) or blood
    (haemothorax), the lung will collapse until the pressure is relieved
-   The build up of fluid or gas will also compress other local organs
    (including the heart), resulting in life threatening complications

A pneumothorax is typically treated by inserting a syringe into the
pleural cavity and draining the excess liquid or gas

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Type I pneumocytes are extremely thin alveolar cells that are
adapted to carry out gas exchange

Â  Â Â 
Pneumocytes (or alveolar cells) are the cells that line the alveoli and
comprise of the majority of the inner surface of the lungs

-   There are two types of alveolar cells â€“ type I pneumocytes and
    type II pneumocytes

Type I pneumocytes

-   Type I pneumocytes are involved in the process of gas exchange
    between the alveoli and the capillaries
-   They are squamous (flattened) in shape and extremely thin (~
    0.15Âµm) â€“ minimising diffusion distance for respiratory gases
-   Type I pneumocytes are connected by occluding junctions, which
    prevents the leakage of tissue fluid into the alveolar air space
-   Type I pneumocytes are amitotic and unable to replicate, however
    type II cells can differentiate into type I cells if required

Type II pneumocytes

-   Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the secretion of pulmonary
    surfactant, which reduces surface tension in the alveoli
-   They are cuboidal in shape and possess many granules (for storing
    surfactant components)
-   Type II pneumocytes only comprise a fraction of the alveolar surface
    (~5%) but are relatively numerous (~60% of total cells)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Type II pneumocytes secrete a solution containing surfactant that
creates a moist surface inside the alveoli to

Â  Â Â prevent the sides of the alveolus adhering to each other by
reducing surface tension

Â  Â Â 
Alveoli are lined by a layer of liquid in order to create a moist
surface conducive to gas exchange with the capillaries

-   It is easier for oxygen to diffuse across the alveolar and capillary
    membranes when dissolved in liquid

While this moist lining assists with gas exchange, it also creates a
tendency for the alveoli to collapse and resist inflation

-   Surface tension is the elastic force created by a fluid surface that
    minimises the surface area (via cohesion of liquid molecules)

Type II pneumocytes secrete a liquid known as pulmonary surfactant which
reduces the surface tension in alveoli

-   As an alveoli expands with gas intake, the surfactant becomes more
    spread out across the moist alveolar lining
-   This increases surface tension and slows the rate of expansion,
    ensuring all alveoli inflate at roughly the same rate

Application:

â€¢ Â External and internal intercostal muscles, and diaphragm and
abdominal muscles as examples of antagonistic

Â  Â Â muscle action

Â  Â Â 
Inspiration (inhaling) and expiration (exhaling) are controlled by two
sets of antagonistic muscle groups

-   Antagonistic means working oppositely â€“ when the inspiratory
    muscles contract, the expiratory musclesÂ relax (and vice versa)

Inspiration

The muscles responsible for inspiration are the diaphragm and external
intercostals (plus some accessory muscles)

-   Diaphragm muscles contract, causing the diaphragm to flatten and
    increase the volume of the thoracic cavity
-   External intercostals contract, pulling ribs upwards and outwards
    (expanding chest)
-   Additional muscle groups may help pull the ribs up and out (e.g.
    sternocleidomastoid and pectoralis minor)Â 

Expiration

The muscles responsible for expiration are the abdominal muscles and
internal intercostals (plus some accessory muscles)

-   Diaphragm muscles relax, causing the diaphragm to curve upwards and
    reduce the volume of the thoracic cavity
-   Internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs inwards and
    downwards (reducing breadth of chest)
-   Abdominal muscles contract and push the diaphragm upwards during
    forced exhalation
-   Additional muscle groups may help pull the ribs downwards (e.g.
    quadratas lumborum)

â€¢ Â Monitoring of ventilation in humans at rest and after mild and
vigorous exercise

Â  Â Â 
Ventilation in humans changes in response to levels of physical
activity, as the bodyâ€™s energy demands are increased

-   ATP production (via cellular respiration) produces carbon dioxide as
    a waste product (and may consume oxygen aerobically)
-   Changes in blood CO₂ levels are detected by chemosensors in the
    walls of the arteries which send signals to the brainstem
-   As exercise intensity increases, so does the demand for gas
    exchange, leading to an increase in levels of ventilation

Exercise will influence ventilation in two main ways:

-   Increase ventilation rate (a greater frequency of breaths allows for
    a more continuous exchange of gases)
-   Increase tidal volume (increasing the volume of air taken in and out
    per breath allows for more air in the lungs to be exchanged)

Trends in Tidal Volume and Breathing Frequency

[ventilation trends]

Measuring Ventilation

Ventilation in humans can be monitored in a number of ways:

-   Via simple observation (counting number of breaths per minute)
-   Chest belt and pressure meter (recording the rise and fall of the
    chest)
-   Spirometer (recording the volume of gas expelled per breath)

Spirometry involves measuring the amount (volume) and / or speed (flow)
at which air can be inhaled or exhaled

-   A spirometer is a device that detects the changes in ventilation and
    presents the data on a digital display
-   A more simplistic method involves breathing into a balloon and
    measuring the volume of air in a single breath
    -   The volume of air can be determined by submerging the balloon in
        water and measuring the volume displaced (1ml = 1cm³)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ventilation maintains concentration gradients of oxygen and carbon
dioxide between air in alveoli and blood

Â  Â Â flowing in adjacent capillaries

Â  Â Â 
Physiological respiration involves the transport of oxygen to cells
within the tissues, where energy production occurs

-   It is comprised of three distinct processes and is not to be
    confused with cellular respiration (a single component of the
    activity)

The processes involved in physiological respiration are:

-   Ventilation: Â The exchange of air between the atmosphere and the
    lungs â€“ achieved by the physical act of breathing
-   Gas Exchange: Â The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between
    the alveoli and bloodstream (via passive diffusion)
-   Cell Respiration: Â The release of energy (ATP) from organic
    molecules â€“ it is enhanced by the presence of oxygen (aerobic)

[physiological respiration]

Purpose of Ventilation

Because gas exchange is a passive process, a ventilation system is
needed to maintain a concentration gradient in alveoli

-   Oxygen is consumed by cells during cellular respiration and carbon
    dioxide is produced as a waste product
-   This means O₂ is constantly being removed from the alveoli into the
    bloodstream (and CO₂Â is continually being released)

The lungs function as a ventilation system by continually cycling fresh
air into the alveoli from the atmosphere

-   This means O₂ levels stay high in alveoli (and diffuse into the
    blood) and CO₂ levels stay low (and diffuse from theÂ blood)
-   The lungs are also structured to have a very large surface area, so
    as to increase the overall rate of gas exchange

Action Potential

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â An action potential consists of depolarization and repolarization
of theÂ neuron

Â  Â Â 
Action potentials are the rapid changes in charge across the membrane
that occur when a neuron is firing

-   Action potentials occur in three main stages: depolarization,
    repolarization and a refractory period

Depolarisation

Depolarisation refers to a sudden change in membrane potential â€“
usually from a (relatively) negative to positiveÂ internal charge

-   In response to a signal initiated at a dendrite, sodium channels
    open within the membrane of the axon
-   As Na⁺ ions are more concentrated outside of theÂ neuron, the
    opening of sodium channels causes a passive influx of sodium
-   The influx of sodium causes the membrane potential to become more
    positive (depolarisation)

[depolarisation]

Repolarisation

Repolarisation refers to the restoration of a membrane potential
following depolarisation (i.e. restoring a negative internal charge)

-   Following an influx of sodium, potassium channels open within the
    membrane of the axon
-   As K⁺ ions are more concentrated inside the neuron, opening
    potassium channels causes a passive efflux of potassium
-   The efflux of potassium causes the membrane potential to return to a
    more negative internal differential (repolarisation)

[repolarisation]

Refractory Period

The refractory period refers to the period of time following a nerve
impulse before the neuron is able to fire again

-   In a normal resting state, sodium ions are predominantly outside the
    neuron and potassium ions mainly inside (resting potential)
-   Following depolarisation (sodium influx) and repolarisation
    (potassium efflux), this ionic distribution is largely reversed
-   Before a neuron can fire again, the resting potential must be
    restored via the antiport action of the sodium-potassium pumpÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A nerve impulse is only initiated if a threshold potential is
reached

Â  Â Â 
Neurotransmitters bind to neuroreceptors on the post-synapticÂ membrane
of target cells and open ligand-gated ion channels

-   The opening of these channels cause small changes in membrane
    potential known as graded potentials

A nerve impulse is only initiated if a threshold potential is reached,
so as to open the voltage-gated ion channels within the axon

-   Excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenaline) cause
    depolarisation by opening ligand-gated sodium or calcium channels
-   Inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g. GABA) cause hyperpolarisation by
    opening ligand-gated potassium or chlorine channels

The combined action of all neurotransmitters acting on a target neuron
determines whether a threshold potential is reached

-   If overall there is more depolarisation than hyperpolarisation and a
    threshold potential is reached, the neuron will fire
-   If overall there is more hyperpolarisation than depolarisation and a
    threshold potential is not reached, the neuron will not fire

For a typicalÂ neuron, the threshold potential (required to open
voltage-gated ion channels) is approximately â€“55 mV

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The myelination of nerve fibres allows for saltatory conduction

Â  Â Â 
In certain neurons, the axon may be covered by a fatty white substance
called myelin which functions as an insulating layer

-   Myelin is a mixture of protein and phospholipids that is produced by
    glial cells (Schwann cells in PNS; oligodendrocytes in CNS)

The main purpose of the myelin sheath is to increase the speed of
electrical transmissions via saltatory conduction

-   Along unmyelinatedÂ neurons, action potentials propagate
    sequentially along the axon in a continuous wave of depolarisation
-   In myelinated neurons, the action potentialsÂ â€˜hop' between the
    gaps inÂ the myelin sheath called the nodes of Ranvier
-   This results in an increase in the speed of electrical conduction by
    a factor of up to 100-fold

Impulse Propagation Along a Myelinated Neuron

[myelin sheath]

Myelination

Not all neurons within the nervous system are insulated with a myelin
sheath

-   The advantage of myelination is that it improves the speed of
    electrical transmission via saltatory conduction
-   The disadvantage of myelination is that it takes up significant
    space within an enclosed environment

Regions of the nervous system composed of myelinated axon tracts appear
as white matter, all other areas appear as grey matter

-   Grey matter consists of neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, as well
    as support cells (glial cells) and synapsesÂ

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nerve impulses are action potentials propagated along the axons
ofÂ neurons

Â  Â Â 
Nerve impulses are action potentials that move along the length of an
axon as a wave of depolarisation

-   Depolarisation occurs when ion channels open and cause a change in
    membrane potential
-   The ion channels that occupy the length of the axon are
    voltage-gated (open in response to changes in membrane potential)
-   Hence, depolarisation at one point of the axon triggers the opening
    of ion channels in the next segment of the axon
-   This causes depolarisation to spread along the length of the axon as
    a unidirectional â€˜waveâ€™

Propagation of a Nerve Impulse

[nerve impulse]

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Propagation of nerve impulses is the result of local currents that
cause each successive part of the axon to

Â  Â Â reach the threshold potential

Â  Â Â 
Action potentials are generated within the axon according to the
all-or-none principle

-   An action potential of the same magnitude will always occur provided
    a minimum electrical stimulus is generated
-   This minimum stimulus â€“ known as the threshold potentialÂ (â€“55
    mV) â€“ is the level required to open voltage-gated ion channelsÂ 
-   If the threshold potential is not reached, an action potential
    cannot be generated and hence the neuron will not fire

Threshold potentials are triggered when the combined stimulation from
the dendrites exceeds a minimum level of depolarisation

-   If the overall depolarisation from the dendrites is sufficient to
    activate voltage-gated ion channels in one section of the axon, the
    resulting displacement of ions should be sufficient to trigger the
    activation of voltage-gated ion channels in the next axon section

Nervous System

The nervous system coordinates the actions of complex organisms via the
transmission of electrochemical signals

-   These signals are transmitted by a specialised network of cells
    called neurons

The nervous system can be divided into two main parts:

-   CNSÂ Â (Central nervous system)Â â€“ Made up of the brain and spinal
    cord
-   PNSÂ  (Peripheral nervous system)Â â€“ Made of peripheral nerves
    which link the CNS to the bodyâ€™s receptors and effectors

Main Components of the Human Nervous System

[CNS vs PNS]

CNS versus PNS

The central nervous system integrates information received from
peripheral nerves and coordinates bodily responses

-   The majority of this activity occurs in the brain, but certain
    responses can be mediated by the spinal cord (reflex actions)

The peripheral nervous system sends information to the CNS via
sensoryÂ neurons and activates effectors via motor neuronsÂ 

-   The peripheral nerves for a particular region of the body feed into
    the spinal cord at a particular site (anatomical dermatome)
-   Consequently, damage to a particular region of the spine will affect
    all body parts innervated by nerves ventral to that region
-   Spinal injuries to the cervical region are most severe as more of
    the body is affected (C1 â€“ C4 injuries impair normal breathing)

Organisation ofÂ the Peripheral Nervous System (Dermatome)

[dermatome]

White Matter versus Grey Matter

The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can be characterised
by two distinct regions â€“ white matter and grey matter

-   White matter is composed of bundles of myelinated axons which
    connect the various grey matter regions together
-   Myelin acts as an insulator and hence nerve signals are transmitted
    at greater speed through white matter
-   Grey matter is composed of the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites,
    as well as unmyelinated nerve fibres
-   Grey matter functions as the regions of the brain where information
    is processed

Cross Section of the Human Brain

[white vs grey matter]

Divisions of the Nervous System

The nervous system can be broken down into several sub-divisions:

-   Firstly, the nervous system can be separated into the central
    nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS)
-   The PNS can be divided into the sensory (afferent) pathway or the
    motor (efferent) pathway
-   The motor pathway can be divided according to whether the response
    is voluntary (somatic) or involuntary (autonomic)
-   Finally, the autonomic division can be split into sympathetic
    (â€˜fight or flightâ€™) or parasympathetic (â€˜rest and digestâ€™)
    responses

Hint: Â How do you remember the difference between the afferent and
efferent pathways when they sound the SAME?

-   SAME:Â Â Sensory neurons = Afferent pathway Â ; Â Motor neurons =
    Efferent pathway

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Neurons transmit electrical impulses

Â 
Neurons are specialised cells that function to transmit electrical
impulses within the nervous system

-   The nervous system converts sensory information into electrical
    impulses in order to rapidly detect and respond to stimuli

While neurons may differ according to role (sensory, relay or motor),
most share three basic components:

-   Dendrites â€“ Short-branched fibres that convert chemical
    information from other neurons or receptor cells into electrical
    signals
-   Axon â€“ An elongated fibre that transmits electrical signals to
    terminal regions for communication with other neurons or effectors
-   Soma â€“ A cell body containing the nucleus and organelles, where
    essential metabolic processes occur to maintain cell survival

In someÂ neurons, the axon may be surrounded by an insulating layer
known as a myelin sheath

-   The myelin sheath improves the conduction speed of electrical
    impulses along the axon, but require additional space and energy

Understanding:

â€¢ Â When presynaptic neurons areÂ depolarized they release a
neurotransmitter into the synapse

Â  Â Â 
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers released from neurons and
function to transmit signals across the synaptic cleft

-   Neurotransmitters are released in response to the depolarisation of
    the axon terminal of a presynapticÂ neuron
-   Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on post-synaptic cells and can
    either trigger (excitatory) or prevent (inhibitory) a response

Neurotransmitters can trigger a variety of responses depending on the
type of cell activated:

[transmitter table]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Secretion and reabsorption of acetylcholine by neurons at synapses

Â  Â Â 
One example of a neurotransmitter used by both the central nervous
system and peripheral nervous system is acetylcholine

-   It is commonly released at neuromuscular junctions and binds to
    receptors on muscle fibres to trigger muscle contraction
-   It is also commonly released within the autonomic nervous system to
    promote parasympathetic responses (â€˜rest and digestâ€™)

Acetylcholine is created in the axon terminal by combining choline with
an acetyl group (derived from mitochondrial Acetyl CoA)

-   Acetylcholine is stored in vesicles within the axon terminal until
    released via exocytosis in response to a nerve impulse

Acetylcholine activates a post-synaptic cell by binding to one of two
classes of specific receptor (nicotinic or muscarinic)

-   Acetylcholine must be continually removed from the synapse, as
    overstimulation can lead to fatal convulsions and paralysis

Acetylcholine is broken down into its two component parts by the
synaptic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE)

-   AChE is either released into the synapse from the presynaptic neuron
    or embedded on the membrane of the post-synaptic cell
-   The liberated choline is returned to the presynaptic neuron where it
    is coupled with another acetate to reform acetylcholine

Acetylcholine Secretion and Reabsorption

[acetylcholine]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Blocking of synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses in
insects by binding of neonicotinoid pesticides to

Â  Â Â acetylcholine receptors

Â  Â Â 
Neonicotinoid pesticides are able to irreversibly bind to nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors and trigger a sustained responseÂ 

-   Neonicotinoid pesticides cannot be broken down by
    acetylcholinesterase, resulting in permanent overstimulation of
    target cells

While low activation of acetylcholine receptors promotes nerve
signalling, overstimulation results in fatal convulsions and paralysis

-   Insects have a different composition of acetylcholine receptors
    which bind to neonicotinoids much more stronglyÂ 
-   Hence, neonicotinoids are significantly more toxic to insects than
    mammals, making them a highly effective pesticide

While neonicotinoids have been successfully used to protect crops from
pest species, there are disadvantages to their usageÂ 

-   Neonicotinoid use has been linked to a reduction in honey bee
    populations (bees are important pollinators within ecosystems)
-   Neonicotinoid use has also been linked to a reduction in bird
    populations (due to the loss of insects as a food source)
-   Consequently, certain countries (including the European Union) have
    restricted the use of neonicotinoid pesticides

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of oscilloscope traces showing resting potentials and
action potentials

Â  Â Â 
Oscilloscopes are scientific instruments that are used to measure the
membrane potential across a neuronal membrane

-   Data is displayed as a graph, with timeÂ (in milliseconds) on the X
    axis and membrane potential (in millivolts) on the Y axis

A typical action potential will last for roughly 3 â€“ 5 milliseconds
and contain 4 key stages:

-   Resting potential: Â Before the action potential occurs, the neuron
    should be in a state of rest (approx. â€“70 mV)
-   Depolarisation: Â A rising spike corresponds to the depolarisation
    of the membrane via sodium influx (up to roughly +30 mV)
-   Repolarisation: Â A falling spike corresponds to repolarisation via
    potassium efflux (undershoots to approx. â€“80 mV)
-   Refractory period: Â The oscilloscope trace returns to the level of
    the resting potential (due to the action of the Na⁺/K⁺ pump)

An action potential will only occur if the initial depolarisation
exceeds a threshold potential of approximately â€“55 mV

Reflex Actions

A reflex is a rapid and involuntary response to a stimulus, resulting
from a simple signalling pathway called a reflex arc

-   Reflex actions do not involve the brain â€“ instead sensory
    information is directly relayed to motor neurons within the spineÂ 
-   This results in a faster response, but one that does not involve
    conscious thought or deliberation

Reflex actions are particularly beneficial in survival situations, when
quick reactions are necessary to avoid permanent damage

-   A common example of a reflex action is the patellar reflex (â€˜knee
    jerkâ€™ response) that occurs when the patellar tendon is tapped
-   The patellar reflex is a common test employed by doctors to
    determine the presence of spinal lesionsÂ

Resting Potential

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Neurons pump sodium and potassium ions across their membranes to
generate a resting potential

Â  Â Â 
Neurons generate and conduct electrical signals by pumping positively
charged ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) across their membrane

-   The unequal distribution of ions on different sides of the membrane
    creates a charge difference called a membrane potential

A resting potential is the difference in charge across the membrane when
a neuron is not firing

-   In a typical resting potential, the inside of the neuron is more
    negative relative to the outside (approximately â€“70 mV)

The maintenance of a resting potential is an active process (i.e. ATP
dependent) that is controlled by sodium-potassium pumps

-   The sodium-potassium pump is a transmembrane protein that actively
    exchanges sodium and potassium ions (antiport)
-   It expels 3 Na⁺ ions for every 2 K⁺ ions admitted (additionally,
    some K⁺ ions will then leak back out of the cell)
-   This creates an electrochemical gradient whereby the cell interior
    is relatively negative compared to the extracellular environment (as
    there are more positively charged ions outside of the cell and more
    negatively charged ions inside the cell)
-   The exchange of sodium and potassium ions requires the hydrolysis of
    ATP (it is an energy-dependent process)

Generation of a Resting Potential

[resting potential]
Stimulus-Response

The basic pathway for a nerve impulse is described by the stimulus
response model

-   A stimulus is a change in the environment (either external or
    internal) that is detected by a receptor
-   Receptors transform environmental stimuli into electrical nerve
    impulses
-   These impulses are then transmitted via neurons to the central
    nervous systemÂ where decision-making occurs
-   When a response is selected (consciously or unconsciously), the
    signal is transmitted viaÂ neurons to effectors
-   Effectors are organs (either muscles or glands) that produce a
    response to a stimulus
-   A response is a change in the organism resulting from the detection
    of a stimulus

Overview of the Stimulus-Response Pathway

[stimulus-response]

Three types of neurons are required to transmit information via the
stimulus-response pathway:

-   Sensory neurons transmit information from sensory receptors to the
    central nervous system (CNS)
-   Relay neurons (interneurons) transmit information within the CNS as
    part of the decision-making process
-   Motor neurons transmit information from the CNS to effectors
    (muscles or glands), in order to initiate a response

While these three types of neurons share common features, their basic
structure may differ slightly according to their function

-   This includes their length, cell body (soma) position and the
    comparative distribution of dendrites and axon terminals

Types of Nerve Cells

[types of neurons]
Summation

Presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters into the synapse to
trigger graded potentials in post-synapticÂ neurons

-   Some generate excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and others
    produce inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs)
-   EPSPs trigger depolarisation in the post-synaptic membrane, IPSPs
    trigger hyperpolarisation in the post-synaptic membrane
-   If the combination of signals reaches a threshold level, an action
    potential will be triggered in the post-synapticÂ neuron

The combination of graded potentials in the post-synaptic neuron is
known as summation

-   Cancellation occurs when excitatory and inhibitory graded potentials
    cancel each other out (no threshold potential reached)
-   Spatial summation occurs when EPSPs are generated from multiple
    presynaptic neurons simultaneously to reach threshold
-   Temporal summation occurs when multiple EPSPs are generated from a
    single presynaptic neuron in quick succession

These summative effects determine which nerve pathways are activated and
hence lead to alternate decision-making processes

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synapses are junctions between neurons and between neurons and
receptor or effector cells

Â  Â Â 
Nerves transmit electrical impulses by changing the ionic distribution
across the neuronal membrane (membrane potential)

-   Therefore, electrical signals are not able to be conducted when a
    semi-permeable membrane is absent

Synapses are the physical gaps that separate neurons from other cells
(otherÂ neurons and receptor or effector cells)

-   Neurons transmit information across synapses by converting the
    electrical signal into a chemical signal

Chemical Transfer Across Synapses

-   When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the
    opening of voltage-gated calcium channels
-   Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) diffuse into the cell and promote the fusion of
    vesicles (containing neurotransmitter) with the cell membrane
-   The neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal by
    exocytosis and cross the synaptic cleft
-   Neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the post-synaptic
    membrane and open ligand-gated ion channels
-   The opening of ion channels generates an electrical impulse in the
    post-synapticÂ neuron, propagating the pre-synaptic signal
-   The neurotransmitters released into the synapse are either recycled
    (by reuptake pumps) or degraded (by enzymatic activity)

Process of Synaptic Signal Transmission

[synaptic transfer]
Types of Neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers released into the synaptic
cleft by neurons

-   They maintain signals in the nervous system by binding to receptors
    on post-synapticÂ neurons and triggering electrical impulses
-   They also activate responses by effector organs (such as contraction
    in muscles or hormone release from endocrine glands)

Neurotransmitters may be either excitatory or inhibitory in their effect
(some may be both depending on the receptor they bind to)

-   Excitatory neurotransmitters trigger depolarisation, increasing the
    likelihood of a response
-   Inhibitory neurotransmitters trigger hyperpolarisation, decreasing
    the likelihood of a response

Major Classes of Neurotransmitter

[types of neurotransmitters]

Examples of Neurotransmitters

Adrenaline

-   Adrenaline is primarily a hormone released by the adrenal gland, but
    some neurons may secrete it as a neurotransmitter
-   It increases heart rate and blood flow, leading to a physical boost
    and heightened awareness
-   It is produced during stressful or exciting situations

Noradrenaline

-   In contrast to adrenaline, noradrenaline is predominantly a
    neurotransmitter that is occasionally released as a hormone
-   It contracts blood vessels and increases blood flow, improving
    attention and the speed at which responsive actions occur

Dopamine

-   It is primarily responsible for feelings of pleasure, but is also
    involved in movement and motivation
-   People tend to repeat behaviours that lead to dopamine release,
    leading to addictions
-   Abnormal dopamine secretion is common in specific movement
    disorders, like Parkinsonâ€™s disease

Serotonin

-   Contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness
-   Is affected by exercise and light exposure, and plays a role in the
    sleep cycle and digestive system regulation

GABA

-   Inhibits neuron firing in the CNS â€“ high levels improve focus
    whereas low levels cause anxiety
-   Also contributes to motor control and vision

Acetylcholine

-   Involved in thought, learning and memory within the brain
-   Activates muscle contraction in the body and is also associated with
    attention and awakening

Glutamate

-   Most common brain neurotransmitter
-   Regulates development and creation of new nerve pathways and hence
    is involved in learning and memory

Endorphins

-   Release is associated with feelings of euphoria and a reduction in
    pain (bodyâ€™s natural 'pain killersâ€™)
-   Released during exercise, excitement and sex
Endocrine System

The endocrine system is a system of ductless glands that release
chemicals (hormones) into the blood to regulate body functions

-   A hormone is a chemical messenger that is transported via the
    bloodstream to act on distant target cells
-   Hormones are specific and will only activate cells or tissues that
    possess the appropriate target receptor
-   The endocrine system is slower to initiate, but has a more prolonged
    response when compared to the nervous system

Endocrine Signalling

[endocrine]

Endocrine Glands

Endocrine glands secrete their product (hormones) directly into the
bloodstream, rather than through a duct (e.g. exocrine gland)

-   Major endocrine glands include the pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid
    gland, pineal gland and the gonads (ovaries and testes)
-   The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine glands and
    function to link the nervous and endocrine systems
-   Some organs may also secrete hormones despite not being endocrine
    glands (e.g. adipose tissue secretes leptin)

Examples of Endocrine Glands

[endocrine table]

Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the section of the brain that links the nervous and
endocrine systems in order to maintain homeostasis

-   It receives information from nerves throughout the body and other
    parts of the brain and initiates endocrine responses
-   It secretes certain neurochemicals (called releasing factors) into a
    portal system which stimulate or inhibit the pituitary gland
-   It also secretes certain hormones directly into the bloodstream via
    neurosecretory cells that extend into the pituitary gland

The pituitary gland lies adjacent to the hypothalamus and is in direct
contact due to a portal blood system

-   The pituitary gland is often referred to as theÂ â€˜master glandâ€™,
    as it controls the secretion of a number of other endocrine glands
-   The pituitary gland receives instructions from the hypothalamus and
    consists of two lobes (anterior and posterior lobe)
    -   The anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) releases hormones in
        response to stimulation by hypothalamic releasing factors
    -   The posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) releases hormones produced
        by the hypothalamus itself (via neurosecretory cells)

The Role of the Hypothalamus and Pituitary Gland in Endocrine Function

[hypothalamus]
Feedback Loops

Physiological processes are commonly moderated via two distinct feedback
mechanisms â€“positive and negative feedback

-   Homeostatic processes are controlled by negative feedback and hence
    these systems occur more commonly within the body

Negative Feedback

Negative feedback involves a response that is the reverse of the change
detected (it functions to reduce the change)

-   A change is detected by a receptor and an effector is activated to
    induce an opposite effect â€“ this promotes equilibrium

Examples of processes that utilise negative feedback loops include
homeostatic systems, such as:

-   Thermoregulation (if body temperature changes, mechanisms are
    induced to restore normal levels)
-   Blood sugar regulation (insulin lowers blood glucose when levels are
    high ; glucagon raises blood glucose when levels are low)
-   Osmoregulation (ADH is secreted to retain water when dehydrated and
    its release is inhibited when the body is hydrated)

Example of a Negative Feedback Loop â€“ Thermoregulation

[negative feedback]

Positive Feedback

Positive feedback involves a response that reinforces the change
detected (it functions to amplify the change)

-   A change is detected by a receptor and an effector is activated to
    induce the same effect â€“ this promotes further change
-   Positive feedback loops will continue to amplify the initial change
    until the stimulus is removed

Examples of processes that utilise positive feedback loops include:

-   Childbirth â€“ stretching of uterine walls cause contractions that
    further stretch the walls (this continues until birthing occurs)
-   Lactation â€“ the child feeding stimulates milk production which
    causes further feeding (continues until baby stops feeding)
-   Ovulation â€“ the dominant follicle releasesÂ oestrogen which
    stimulates LH and FSH release to promote further follicular growth
-   Blood clotting â€“ platelets release clotting factors which cause
    more platelets to aggregate at the site of injury

Structures of the Female Reproductive System

The following structures all contribute to the production
andÂ maintenance of an egg as part of the female reproductive process

-   Structures are organised according to the path taken by egg (from
    production to implantation or elimination)

Ovary

-   The ovary is where oocytes mature prior to release (ovulation) â€“
    it also responsible for estrogen and progesterone secretion

Fimbria

-   Fimbria (plural:Â fimbriae) are a fringe of tissue adjacent to an
    ovary that sweep an oocyte into the oviductÂ 

Oviduct

-   The oviduct (or fallopian tube) transports the oocyte to the uterus

Uterus

-   The uterus is the organ where a fertilised egg will implant and
    develop (becoming anÂ embryo)

Endometrium

-   The mucous membrane lining of the uterus, it thickens in preparation
    for implantation or is otherwise lost (via menstruation)

Vagina

Gender Issues

The terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, however there
are key distinctions between the two terms:

-   Sex describes the biological differences between males and females
    (e.g. genitalia, karyotype, hormone profiles, etc.)
-   Gender describes the characteristics that society delineates as
    masculine or feminineÂ 

Normally, sex determination happensÂ pre-natally and so infants are
categorised at birth as either male or female

-   The biological differences that exist between the sexes result from
    the presence or absence of a Y chromosome
-   All embryos will develop as females unless genes present on the Y
    chromosome trigger male sex development

Males

-   Males possess the SRY gene (on the Y chromosome), which synthesises
    testis determining factor (TDF)
-   The testis produces a hormone called MIF (Mullerian Inhibiting
    Factor), which causes degeneration of female organsÂ 
-   The testis also produces testosterone, which promotes the
    development of male sex characteristics

Females

-   Females do not possess the SRY gene (do not have a Y chromosome),
    and so do not produce TDF or form testes
-   Consequently, MIF is not produced and the female organs are allowed
    to develop (ovaries are formed)
-   Ovaries do not produce testosterone and so female sex
    characteristics develop

Sex Determination

[gonad differentiation]

Sometimes errors occur during this prenatal development of sex
characteristics, leading to issues in the assignment of gender

-   Examples of conditions where sexual development does not follow
    standard genetic instructions includeÂ androgen insensitivity
    syndrome and guevedoces (late onset sex development)Â 

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome

-   Individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome do not respond to
    the production of testosterone
-   Testosterone is responsible for the development of male sex
    characteristics (female sex characteristics develop in its absence)
-   Males who suffer from androgen insensitivity do not therefore
    develop external male genitalia (despite having internal testes)
-   Because they do not respond to testosterone, they develop female sex
    characteristics (such as enlarged breasts)
-   Despite being genetically male (XY), these individuals physically
    resemble females and will associate with that gender

Guevedoces

-   Guevedoces are girls who turn into boys at puberty
-   Guevedoces possess a rare genetic mutation which prevents the
    synthesis of the enzyme 5-Î±-reductase
-   This enzyme converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT),
    triggering a hormone surge that develops male genitalia
-   Without this enzyme, genetic males (XY) do not initially develop
    male genitals and instead develop as females
-   A second hormone surge occurs with the onset of puberty, and it is
    at this point that the male genitals develop

Homeostasis

Homeostasis is the tendency for an organism or cell to maintain a
constant internal environment within tolerance limits

Internal equilibrium is maintained by adjusting physiological processes,
including:

-   Body temperature (normally between 36 â€“ 38ÂºC)
-   Carbon dioxide concentration (normally 35 â€“ 45 mmHg)
-   Blood pH (normally between 7.35 â€“ 7.45)
-   Blood glucose levels (normally 75 â€“ 95 mg/dL)
-   Water balance (varies depending on individual body size)

Homeostatic mechanisms operate via a feedback loop that may involve
either the nervous or endocrine systems (or both)

-   When specialised receptors detect an internal change to conditions,
    a response is generated to correct the change
-   Most homeostatic responses involve an effect that is antagonistic to
    the detected stimulus (negative feedback)
-   When levels return to equilibrium, the effector ceases to generate a
    response and an internal balance is therefore maintained
-   If a physiological condition moves outside of tolerance limits,
    disease will occur as a consequence

Insulin and Glucagon

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Insulin and glucagon are released byÂ Î² andÂ Î±Â cells of the
pancreas to control blood glucose concentration

Â  Â Â 
The body needs glucose to make ATP (via cell respiration), however the
amount required will fluctuate according to demand

-   High levels of glucose in the blood can damage cells (creates
    hypertonicity) and hence glucose levels must be regulated

Two antagonistic hormones are responsible for regulating blood glucose
concentrations â€“ insulin and glucagon

-   These hormones are released from pancreatic pits (called the islets
    of Langerhans) and act principally on the liver

When blood glucose levels are high (e.g. after feeding):

-   Insulin is released from beta (Î²) cells of the pancreas and cause a
    decrease in blood glucose concentration
-   This may involve stimulating glycogen synthesis in the liver
    (glycogenesis), promoting glucose uptake by the liver and adipose
    tissue, or increasing the rate of glucose breakdown (by increasing
    cell respiration rates)

When blood glucose levels are low (e.g. after exercise):

-   Â Glucagon is released from alpha (Î±) cells of the pancreas and
    cause an increase in blood glucose concentration
-   This may involve stimulating glycogen breakdown in the liver
    (glycogenolysis), promoting glucose release by the liver and adipose
    tissue, or decreasing the rate of glucose breakdown (by reducing
    cell respiration rates)

Regulating Blood Glucose Concentrations

[blood glucose]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes

Â  Â Â 
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that results from a high blood
glucose concentration over a prolonged period

-   It is caused by the body either not producing insulin (Type I) or
    failing to respond to insulin production (Type II)
-   It is treated with either insulin injections (Type I only) or by
    carefully monitoring and controlling dietary intake (Type II)

List

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â The use in IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of
hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of

Â  Â Â hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy

Â  Â Â 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) refers to fertilisation that occurs outside
of the body (in vitro = 'in glassâ€™)

-   It involves using drugs to suspend normal ovulation (down
    regulation), before using hormone treatments to collect multiple
    eggs (superovulation)Â 

Down regulation

-   Drugs are used to halt the regular secretion of FSH and LH â€“ this
    in turn stops the secretion of estrogen and progesterone
-   By arresting the hormonal cycle, doctors can take control of the
    timing and quantity of egg production by the ovaries
-   The drug treatment usually takes about two weeks and is typically
    delivered in the form of a nasal spray

Superovulation

-   Superovulation involves using artificial doses of hormones to
    develop and collect multiple eggs from the woman
-   The patient is firstly injected with large amounts of FSH to
    stimulate the development of many follicles
-   The follicles are then treated with human chorionic gonadotrophin
    (hCG) â€“ a hormone usually produced by a developing embryo
-   hCG stimulates the follicles to mature and the egg is then collected
    (via aspiration with a needle) prior to the follicles rupturing

Fertilisation

-   The extracted eggs are then incubated in the presence of a sperm
    sample from the male donor
-   The eggs are then analysed under a microscope for successful
    fertilisation

Implantation

-   Approximately two weeks prior to implantation, the woman begins to
    take progesterone treatments to develop the endometrium
-   Healthy embryos are selected and transferred into the female uterus
    (or the uterus of a surrogate)
-   Multiple embryos are transferred to improve chances of successful
    implantation (hence multiple births are a possible outcome)
-   Roughly two weeks after the procedure, a pregnancy test is taken to
    determine if the process has been successful

Leptin

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and act on the
hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite

Â  Â Â 
Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose cells that regulates fat stores
within the body by suppressing appetite

-   Leptin binds to receptors located within the hypothalamus to inhibit
    appetite and thereby reduce food intake

Overeating causes more adipose cells to formed and hence more leptin is
produced, suppressing further appetite

-   Conversely, periods of starvation lead to a reduction in adipose
    tissue and hence less leptin is released, triggering hunger

As obese people are constantly producing higher levels of leptin, their
body becomes progressively desensitised to the hormone

-   This means they are more likely to feel hungry, less likely to
    recognise when they are full and are hence more likely to overeat
-   Leptin resistance also develops with age, increasing the potential
    for weight gain later in life (e.g. theÂ â€˜middle-age spreadâ€™)

The Role of Leptin in Hunger and Satiety

[leptin]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Testing of leptin on patients with clinical obesity and reasons
for the failure to control the disease

Â  Â Â 
Because leptin suppresses appetite, it was considered as a form of
treatment for individuals with clinical obesity

-   Theoretically, leptin injections would reduce hunger and limit food
    intake in obese individuals, leading to weight loss

Mice Experiments

Leptin trials were initially conducted by surgically fusing the blood
circulation of obese and healthy mice (parabiosis)

-   This experiment was conducted using mice that were either obese due
    to a leptin gene mutation or a defective leptin receptor

When the obese mouse with no leptin was parabiotically fused to a
healthy mouse:

-   Leptin in the blood of the healthy mouse was transferred to the
    obese mouse
-   The obese mouse responded to the leptin and began to lose weight,
    demonstrating the potential viability of leptin treatment

However, when the obese mouse with a defective leptin receptor was
parabiotically fused to a healthy mouse:

-   Leptin was transferred to the healthy mouse (the obese mouse
    overproduced leptin to compensate for low receptor sensitivity)Â 
-   The obese mouse remained obese as its body could not respond to
    leptin
-   The healthy mouse became emaciated due to the abnormally high levels
    of leptin transferred into its bloodstream

[leptin experiments]

Human Experiments

Most humans have naturally high levels of leptin in the bloodstream

-   When linked to leptin activity, most cases of obesity are caused by
    an unresponsiveness to leptin and not a leptin deficiencyÂ 
-   Hence, in clinical trials, very few participants experienced
    significant weight loss in response to leptin injections
-   However, many patients did experience adverse side effects from
    leptin injections, including skin irritations
-   For these reasons, leptin treatments are not considered to be an
    effective way of controlling obesity

Melatonin

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland to control circadian
rhythms

Â  Â Â 
Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland within the brain in
response to changes in light

-   Light exposure to the retina is relayed via the suprachiasmatic
    nucleus (in the hypothalamus) and inhibits melatonin secretion
-   Melatonin is therefore secreted in response to periods of darkness,
    resulting in higher concentrations at night

Melatonin Secretion by the Pineal Gland

[pineal gland]

Circadian Rhythms

Melatonin secretion by the pineal gland of the brain plays a pivotal
role in the control of circadian rhythmsÂ 

-   Circadian rhythms are the bodyâ€™s physiological responses to the 24
    hour day-night cycle
-   Circadian rhythms are driven by an internal (endogenous) circadian
    clock, although they can be modulated by external factors

Melatonin is the hormone responsible for synchronising circadian rhythms
and regulates the body's sleep schedule

-   Melatonin secretion is suppressed by bright light (principally blue
    wavelengths) and hence levels increase during the night
-   Over a prolonged period, melatonin secretion becomes entrained to
    anticipate the onset of darkness and the approach of dayÂ 
-   Melatonin functions to promote activity in nocturnal animals and
    conversely promotes sleep in diurnal animals (like humans)
-   During sleep, necessary physiological changes occur in body
    temperature, brain wave activity and hormonal production
-   Melatonin levels naturally decrease with age, leading to changes in
    sleeping patterns in the elderly

Melatonin Secretion Over a Day-Night Cycle

[circadian rhythm]

[ninja icon]

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes of jet lag and use of melatonin to alleviate it

Â  Â Â 
Jet Lag

Jet lag is a physiological condition resulting from a change to the
bodyâ€™s normal circadian rhythm

-   This alteration is caused by the bodyâ€™s inability to rapidly
    adjust to a new time zone following extended air travel ('jet' lag)
-   The pineal gland continues to secrete melatonin according to the old
    time zone so that the sleep schedule is not synchronised to the new
    timezone

As a result of these sleep disturbances, individuals suffering from jet
lag will often experience symptoms associated with fatigue

-   Symptoms of jet lag include headaches, lethargy, increased
    irritability and reduced cognitive function
-   Jet lag should only last a few days and symptoms should resolve as
    the body resynchronises its circadian rhythm

Some health professionals recommend taking melatonin near the sleep time
of the new time zone to help recalibrate the body

-   By artificially increasing melatonin levels at the new night time,
    the body can respond quicker to the new day-night schedule

Menstrual Cycle

Previous

Next

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive
feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and

Â  Â Â pituitary hormones

Â  Â Â 
The menstrual cycle describes recurring changes that occur within the
female reproductive system to make pregnancy possible

-   Each menstrual cycle lasts roughly one month (~28 days) and begins
    at puberty (menarche) before ending with menopause

There are two key groups of hormones which control and coordinate the
menstrual cycle:

-   Pituitary hormones (FSH and LH) are released from the anterior
    pituitary gland and act on the ovaries to develop follicles
-   Ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone) are released from the
    ovaries and act on the uterus to prepare for pregnancy

Menstrual Hormones

[menstrual hormones]

Flowchart of Hormonal Actions During Menstrual Cycle

[menstrual flowchart]

Key Events in the Menstrual Cycle

There are four key events that comprise a typical menstrual cycle:
follicular phase, ovulation, luteal phase and menstruation

-   These events are distinguished by changes to hormonal levels,
    follicular development and the status of the endometrium

1. Â Follicular Phase

-   Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is secreted from the anterior
    pituitary and stimulates growth of ovarian follicles
-   The dominant follicle produces estrogen, which inhibits FSH
    secretion (negative feedback) to prevent other follicles growing
-   Estrogen acts on the uterus to stimulate the thickening of the
    endometrial layer

2.Â Â Ovulation

-   Midway through the cycle (~ day 12), estrogen stimulates the
    anterior pituitary to secrete hormones (positive feedback)
-   This positive feedback results in a large surge of luteinizing
    hormone (LH) and a lesser surge of FSH
-   LH causes the dominant follicle to rupture and release an egg
    (secondary oocyte) â€“ this is called ovulation

3.Â Â Luteal Phase

-   The ruptured follicle develops into a slowly degenerating corpus
    luteum
-   The corpus luteum secretes high levels of progesterone, as well as
    lower levels ofÂ oestrogen
-   Estrogen and progesterone act on the uterus to thicken the
    endometrial lining (in preparation for pregnancy)
-   Estrogen and progesterone also inhibit secretion of FSH and LH,
    preventing any follicles from developing

4.Â Â Menstruation

-   If fertilisation occurs, the developing embryo will implant in the
    endometrium and release hormones to sustain the corpusÂ luteum
-   If fertilisation doesnâ€™t occur, the corpus luteum eventually
    degenerates (forming a corpus albicans after ~ 2 weeks)
-   When the corpus luteum degenerates, estrogen and progesteron levels
    drop and the endometrium can no longer be maintained
-   The endometrial layer is sloughed away and eliminated from the body
    as menstrual blood (i.e. a womanâ€™s period)
-   As estrogen and progesterone levels are too now low to inhibit the
    anterior pituitary, the cycle can now begin again

-   Day 1 â€“ 5: Â The average period lasts ~ 5 days, during which the
    body may release prostaglandins (causing cramps)
-   Day 6 â€“ 11: Â Estrogen levels rise during the follicular phase,
    making a woman feel more confident and flirtatious
-   Day 12 â€“ 15: Â Nearing ovulation, the woman will be most fertile
    â€“ this is the best (or worst!) time to try for pregnancy
-   Day 14 â€“ 15: Â With ovulation, estrogen levels drop temporarily,
    which may lead a woman to feel cranky or emotional
-   Day 16 â€“ 19: Â Estrogen and progesterone release prepare for
    pregnancy and can lead to breast tenderness
-   Day 20 â€“ 21: Â If fertilisation hasnâ€™t occurred by this point,
    the ovaries will stop producing estrogen and progesterone
-   Day 22 â€“ 28: Â Falling levels of hormones will cause irritability
    and may lead to craving for sugary foods (beware zits!)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A gene on the Y chromosome causes embryonic gonads to develop as
testes and secrete testosterone

Â  Â Â 
Humans have 46 chromosomes in all diploid somatic cells â€“ 22 pairs are
autosomes and the 23^(rd) pair are the sex chromosomes

-   Females possess two copies of the X chromosome (XX), while males
    possess one X and a shorter Y chromosome (XY)

The Y chromosome includes a gene called the SRY gene (Sex Determining
Region Y), which leads to male development

-   The SRY gene codes for a testis-determining factor (TDF) that causes
    embryonic gonads to form into testes (male gonads)
-   In the absence of the TDF protein (i.e. no Y chromosome), the
    embryonic gonads will develop into ovaries (female gonads)

The male and female gametes produce different hormones to promote
further development of sex characteristics:

-   The testes produce testosterone to promote the further development
    of male sex characteristicsÂ 
-   The ovaries will produce estrogen and progesterone to promote the
    development of female sex characteristics

Sex Determination in Humans

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Testosterone causes pre-natal development of male genitalia and
both sperm production and development of

Â  Â Â male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty

Â  Â Â 
The main male reproductive hormone is testosterone, which is secreted by
the testes and serves a number of roles:

-   It is responsible for the pre-natal development of male genitalia
-   It is involved in sperm production following the onset of puberty
-   It aids in the development of secondary sex characteristics
    (including body hair, muscle mass, deepening of voice, etc.)
-   It helps to maintain the male sex drive (libido)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Estrogen and progesterone cause pre-natal development of female
reproductive organs and female secondary

Â  Â Â sexual characteristics during puberty

Â  Â Â 
The main female reproductive hormones (secreted by the ovaries) are
estrogen and progesterone, which serve several roles:

-   They promote the pre-natal development of the female reproductive
    organs
-   They are responsible for the development of secondary sex
    characteristics (including body hair and breast development)
-   They are involved in monthly preparation of egg release following
    puberty (via the menstrual cycle)

Initially, estrogen and progesterone are secreted by the motherâ€™s
ovaries and then the placenta â€“ until female reproductive organs
develop (this occurs in the absence of testosterone)

Sexual Reproduction

Application:

â€¢ Â William Harveyâ€™s investigation of sexual reproduction in deer

Â  Â Â 
Historical Perspective of Sexual Reproduction

One of the earliest theories as to how animals reproduce sexually was
the 'soil and seed' theory proposed by Aristotle

-   According to this theory, the male produces aÂ â€˜seed' which forms
    anÂ â€˜egg' when mixed with menstrual blood (theÂ â€˜soilâ€™)
-   TheÂ â€˜eggâ€™ then develops into a fetus inside the mother
    according to the information contained within the male
    'seedâ€™Â alone

Debunking theÂ â€™Soil and Seedâ€™ TheoryÂ 

TheÂ â€˜soil and seedâ€™ theory was a popular doctrine for hundreds of
years before it was eventually debunked by William Harvey

-   William Harvey studied the sexual organs of female deer after mating
    in an effort to identify the developing embryo
-   He was unable to detect a growing embryo until approximately 6 â€“ 7
    weeks after mating had occurred
-   He concluded that Aristotleâ€™s theory was incorrect and that
    menstrual blood did not contribute to the development of aÂ fetus
-   Harvey was unable to identify the correct mechanism of sexual
    reproduction and incorrectly asserted that the fetus did not develop
    from a mixture of male and femaleÂ â€˜seedsâ€™

Contrasting Theories of Sexual Reproduction

[soil and seed theory]

Modern Theory of Sexual Reproduction

Our current understanding of the mechanism of sexual reproduction is
based on evidence discovered using light microscopes

-   Viable microscopes for such investigations were not invented until
    17 years after the death of William Harvey

Based on available evidence, it is now known that a fetus forms from a
combination of both male and femalesÂ â€˜seedsâ€™ (gametes)

Thyroxin

List

[ninja icon]

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Thyroxin is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the
metabolic rate and help control body temperature

Â  Â Â 
Thyroxin is a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland in response to
signals initially derived from the hypothalamus

-   Thyroxin acts on nearly every tissue in the body and is essential to
    the proper development and differentiation of cells

The primary role of thyroxin is to increase the basal metabolic rate
(amount of energy the body uses at rest)

-   This can be achieved by stimulating carbohydrate and lipid
    metabolism via the oxidation of glucose and fatty acids

A consequence of increasing metabolic activity is the production of heat
â€“ hence thyroxin helps to control body temperature

-   Thyroxin is released in response to a decrease in body temperature
    in order to stimulate heat production

Thyroxin is partially composed of iodine and hence a deficiency of
iodine in the diet will lead to decreased production of thyroxin

-   Iodine deficiency will cause the thyroid gland to become enlarged,
    resulting in a disease known as goitre

Types of Hormones

Hormones can be categorised into three distinct groups according to
their chemical composition

-   The three types of hormones are steroid hormones, peptide hormones
    and amino acid derivatives
-   The different types of hormones will have different mechanisms of
    action due to their distinct chemical properties

Steroid Hormones

-   Steroid hormones are lipophilic (fat-loving) â€“ meaning they can
    freely diffuse across the plasma membrane of a cell
-   They bind to receptors in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of the
    target cell, to form an active receptor-hormone complex
-   This activated complex will move into the nucleus and bind directly
    to DNA, acting as a transcription factor for gene expression
-   Examples of steroid hormones include those produced by the gonads
    (i.e. estrogen, progesterone and testosterone)

[steroid hormones]

Peptide Hormones

-   Peptide hormones are hydrophylic and lipophobic (fat-hating) â€“
    meaning they cannot freely cross the plasma membrane
-   They bind to receptors on the surface of the cell, which are
    typically coupled to internally anchored proteins (e.g. G proteins)
-   The receptor complex activates a series of intracellular molecules
    called second messengers, which initiate cell activity
-   This process is called signal transduction, because the external
    signal (hormone) is transduced via internal intermediaries
-   Examples of second messengers include cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium
    ions (Ca²⁺), nitric oxide (NO) and protein kinases
-   The use of second messengers enables the amplification of the
    initial signal (as more molecules are activated)
-   Peptide hormones include insulin, glucagon, leptin, ADH and oxytocin

[peptide hormones]

Amine Hormones

-   Amine hormones are derived from the amino acid tyrosine and include
    adrenaline, thyroxin andÂ triiodothyronine
-   Amine hormones do not all share identical properties and have
    properties common to both peptide and steroid hormonesÂ

Why the change?

While the new IB syllabus covers much the same content as the old
syllabus, the style has changed significantly:

-   The old syllabus was organised into dot points, each of which
    included a specific command term that identified the level of
    knowledge required
-   The new syllabus is organised into assessment statements that do not
    include command terms â€“ this makes the knowledge requirements
    broader and vague

To reflect this change, the new website no longer addresses content as
an itemised list, however every assessment statement is still
specifically covered

-   For each sub-topic, assessment statements are grouped and organised
    by subject matter and explained as part of the core content
-   Additional information that helps with understanding but is not
    specifically referenced by an assessment statement is included as
    extra content

The new layout is not as concise as the old layout, but this is because
the new syllabus is not as concise as the old syllabus

-   The new layout is a lot prettier than the old layout though â€“ hope
    you like it!

Understanding:

â€¢ Â High concentrations of solutes in the phloem at the source lead to
water uptake by osmosis

â€¢ Â Incompressibility of water allows transport along hydrostatic
pressure gradients

Â  Â Â 
At the Source

-   The active transport of solutes (such as sucrose) into the phloem by
    companion cells makes the sap solution hypertonic
-   This causes water to be drawn from the xylem via osmosis (water
    moves towards higher solute concentrations)
-   Due to the incompressibility of water, this build up of water in the
    phloem causes the hydrostatic pressure to increase
-   This increase in hydrostatic pressure forces the phloem sap to move
    towards areas of lower pressure (mass flow)
-   Hence, the phloem transports solutes away from the source (and
    consequently towards the sink)

Active Translocation via Mass Flow

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Raised hydrostatic pressure causes the contents of the phloem to
flow towards sinks

Â  Â Â 
At the Sink

-   The solutes within the phloem are unloaded by companion cells and
    transported into sinks (roots, fruits, seeds, etc.)
-   This causes the sap solution at the sink to become increasingly
    hypotonic (lower solute concentration)
-   Consequently, water is drawn out of the phloem and back into the
    xylem by osmosis
-   This ensures that the hydrostatic pressure at the sink is always
    lower than the hydrostatic pressure at the source
-   Hence, phloem sap will always move from the source towards the sink
-   When organic molecules are transported into the sink, they are
    either metabolised or stored within the tonoplast of vacuoles

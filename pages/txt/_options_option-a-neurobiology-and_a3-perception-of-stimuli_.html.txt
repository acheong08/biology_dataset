A3 Â Perception of Stimuli

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Living organisms are able to detect
changes in the environment

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Receptors detect changes in the environment
-   Rods and cones are photoreceptors located in the retina
-   Rods and cones differ in their sensitivities to light intensities
    and wavelengths
-   Bipolar cells send the impulses from rods and cones to ganglion
    cells
-   Ganglion cells send messages to the brain via the optic nerve
-   The information from the right field of vision from both eyes is
    sent to the left part of the visual cortex and vice versa
-   Structures in the middle ear transmit and amplify sound
-   Sensory hairs of the cochlea detect sounds of specific wavelengths
-   Impulses caused by sound perception are transmitted to the brain via
    the auditory nerve
-   Hair cells in the semicircular canals detect movement of the head

Applications:

-   Red-green colour-blindness as a variant of normal trichromatic
    vision
-   Detection of chemicals in the air by the many different olfactory
    receptors
-   Use of cochlear implants in deaf patients

Skills:

-   Labelling a diagram of the structure of the human eye
-   Annotation of a diagram of the retina to show the cell types and the
    direction in which light moves
-   Labelling a diagram of the structure of the human ear

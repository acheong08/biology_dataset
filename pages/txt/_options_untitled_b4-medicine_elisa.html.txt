â€¢ Â Interpretation of the results of an ELISA diagnostic test

Â  Â  Â Â 
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a test that uses enzymes
and colour changes to identify a substance

-   It can be used to identify specific surface markers or metabolites
    associated with particular diseases

Different variations of the ELISA test exist, but one of the most common
protocols involves the sandwich method:

-   Known monoclonal antibodies are affixed to wells in a plate (these
    are the 'capture antibodies')
-   A sample to be tested is added to the wells and any antigens present
    will bind to the appropriate capture antibody
-   The plates are then washed to remove any unbound antigen
-   A second set of monoclonal antibodies linked to colour-changing
    enzymes are then added to the wells
-   These 'detection antibodiesâ€™ will bind to any antigens captured,
    creating a sandwich (antibody - antigen - antibody)
-   The wells are then washed again to remove any unbound detection
    antibodies
-   When an appropriate substrate is added to the wells, the
    enzyme-linked detection antibodies will trigger a colour change
-   Only wells in which a sandwich complex has formed will show a colour
    change, hence identifying the presence of an antigen

Interpreting ELISA Tests

ELISA tests can be used to diagnose disease conditions based on the
presence of disease markers (antigens, metabolites)

-   Samples taken from infected patients will induce a colour change
    when treated with appropriate detection antibodies
-   The amount of colour change can be used to signify rate of disease
    progression (more marker = more colour change)Â

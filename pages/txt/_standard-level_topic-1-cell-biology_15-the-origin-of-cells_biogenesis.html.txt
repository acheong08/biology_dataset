Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cells can only be formed by division of pre-existing cells

Â  Â Â 
The chemical processes that contributed to the initial formation of
biological life required specific conditions to proceed

-   This included a reducing atmosphere and high temperatures (>100ÂºC)
    or electrical discharges to catalyse chemical reactions

These conditions do not commonly exist on modern Earth and hence living
cells cannot arise independently by abiogenesis

-   Instead, cells can only be formed by the division of pre-existing
    cells (biogenesis)Â

Application:

â€¢ Â Evidence from Pasteurâ€™s experiments that spontaneous generation
of cells and organisms does notÂ nowÂ 

Â  Â occurÂ on Earth

Â  Â Â 
Biogenesis describes the principle that living things only arise from
other living things by reproduction (not spontaneous generation)

-   "Omne vivum ex vivoâ€?Â â€“ All life (is) from life

The law of biogenesis is largely attributed to Louis Pasteur, who
demonstrated that emergent bacterial growth in nutrient broths was due
to contamination by pre-existing cells

-   Broths were stored in vessels that contained long tubings (swan neck
    ducts) that did not allow external dust particles to pass
-   The broths were boiled to kill any micro-organisms present in the
    growth medium (sterilisation)
-   Growth only occurred in the broth if the flask was broken open,
    exposing the contents to contaminants from the outside
-   From this it was concluded that emergent bacterial growth came from
    external contaminants and did not spontaneously occur

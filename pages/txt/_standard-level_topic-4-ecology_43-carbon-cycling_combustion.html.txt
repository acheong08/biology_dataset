Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of biomass and
fossilised organic matter

Â  Â Â 

[carbon combustion]

When organic compounds rich in hydrocarbons are heated in the presence
of oxygen, they undergo a combustion reaction

-   This reaction is exergonic (produces energy) and releases carbon
    dioxide and water as by-products
-   The carbon dioxide is typically released into the atmosphere,
    increasing the concentration of the gas in the air

Example: Combustion of Propane Â = Â C₃H₈ + 5 O₂Â Â â†’Â Â 3 CO₂ + 4
H₂O + energy

Combustion Sources

1. Â Fossil Fuels

Organic compounds can become rich in hydrocarbons when compacted
underground for millions of years

-   The heat and pressure over time triggers a chemical transformation
    that results in the compaction of the organic matter
-   The resulting products of this process are fossil fuels (coal, oil
    and natural gas)
-   Because this geological process takes millions of years to occur,
    fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source

2. Â Biomass

An alternative to relying on fuels produced by geological processes is
to manufacture fuels from biological processes

-   Living organisms produce hydrocarbons as part of their total biomass
    (either for use or as a waste product)
-   These hydrocarbons can be extracted and purified to produce an
    alternative fuel source (e.g. bioethanol and biodiesel)
-   Provided new raw materials are provided and waste products are
    removed, this source of energy is renewable

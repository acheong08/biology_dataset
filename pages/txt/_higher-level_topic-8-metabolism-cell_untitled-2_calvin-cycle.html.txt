Application:

â€¢ Â Calvinâ€™s experiment to elucidate the carboxylation of RuBP

Â  Â Â 
The light independent reactions are also collectively known as the
Calvin cycle â€“ named after American chemist Melvin Calvin

-   Calvin mapped the complete conversion of carbon within a plant
    during the process of photosynthesis

Calvinâ€™s elucidation of photosynthetic carbon compounds is commonly
classed theÂ â€˜lollipop experimentâ€™

-   This is due to the fact that the apparatus he utilised was thought
    to resemble an upside-down lollipop

Lollipop Experiment

-   Radioactive carbon-14 is added to aÂ â€˜lollipopâ€™Â apparatus
    containing green algae (Chlorella)
-   Light is shone on the apparatus to induce photosynthesis (which will
    incorporate the carbon-14 into organic compounds)
-   After different periods of time, the algae is killed by running it
    into a solution of heated alcohol (stops cell metabolism)
-   Dead algal samples are analysed using 2D chromatography, which
    separates out the different carbon compounds
-   Any radioactive carbon compounds on the chromatogram were then
    identified using autoradiography (X-ray film exposure)
-   By comparing different periods of light exposure, the order by which
    carbon compounds are generated was determined
-   Calvin used this information to propose a sequence of events known
    as the Calvin cycle (light independent reactions) Â

Key Events of the Calvin Cycle

The Calvin cycle outlines the events that result in the formation of
organic molecules from inorganic sources (CO₂)

-   Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) is carboxylated by carbon
    dioxideÂ (CO₂) to form a hexose biphosphate compound
-   The hexose biphosphate compound immediately breaks down into
    molecules ofÂ glycerate-3-phosphate (GP)
-   The GP is converted by ATP and NADPH into molecules of triose
    phosphate (TP)
-   TP can be used to form organic molecules or can be recombined by ATP
    to reform stocks of RuBP

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Prokaryotes have one chromosome consisting of a circular DNA
molecule

Â  Â Â 
Prokaryotes do not possess a nucleus â€“ instead genetic material is
found free in the cytoplasm in a region called the nucleoid

The genetic material of a prokaryote consists of a single chromosome
consisting of a circular DNA molecule (genophore)

-   The DNA of prokaryotic cells is naked â€“ meaning it is not
    associated with proteins for additional packaging

In addition to the genophore, prokaryotic cells may possess additional
circular DNA molecules called plasmids

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some prokaryotes also have plasmids but eukaryotes do not

Â  Â Â 
Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that contain only a few genes
and are capable of self-replication

-   Plasmids are present in some prokaryotic cells, but are not
    naturally present in eukaryotic cells

Bacterial cells may exchange plasmids via their sex pili, in a process
known as bacterial conjugation

-   This exchange of genetic material allows bacteria to evolve new
    features within a generation (horizontal gene transfer)

As plasmids can self-replicate and autonomously synthesise proteins,
they are ideal vectors for gene manipulation in labs

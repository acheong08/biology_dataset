Species Interactions

In nature no species exists in total isolation â€“ all organisms
interact with both the abiotic environment and other organisms

-   If two species interact directly within a shared environment, they
    share a positive association (they co-exist)
-   If interactions within an environment are mutually detrimental to
    both species, they share a negative association (do not co-exist)

Positive Associations

1. Â Predator-Prey Relationships

-   Predation is a biological interaction whereby one organism
    (predator) hunts and feeds on another organism (prey)
-   Because the predator relies on the prey as a food source, their
    population levels are inextricably intertwined
    -   If the prey population drops (e.g. due to over-feeding),
        predator numbers will dwindle as intra-specific competition
        increases
    -   If the prey population rises, predator numbers will increase as
        a result of the over-abundance of a food source

2. Â Symbiotic Relationships

-   Symbiosis describes the close and persistent (long-term) interaction
    between two species
-   Symbiotic relationships can be obligate (required for survival) or
    facultative (advantageous without being strictly necessary)
-   Symbiotic relationships can be beneficial to either one or both
    organisms in the partnership:
    -   Mutualism â€“ Both species benefit from the interaction (anemone
        protects clownfish, clownfish provides fecal matter for food)
    -   Commensalism â€“ One species benefits, the other is unaffected
        (barnacles are transported to plankton-rich waters by whales)
    -   Parasitism â€“ One species benefits to the detriment of the
        other species (ticks and fleas feed on the blood of their canine
        host) Â

Negative Associations

1. Â Competition

-   Competition describes the interaction between two organisms whereby
    the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of the other
-   Competition can beÂ intraspecific (between members of same species)
    or interspecific (between members of different species)
-   Limited supplies of resources (e.g. food, water, territory) usually
    triggers one of two types of responses:
    -   Competitive exclusion â€“ One species uses the resources more
        efficiently, driving the other species to local extinction
    -   Resource partitioning â€“ Both species alter their use of the
        environment to divide the resources between them

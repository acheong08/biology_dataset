Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA is replicated before meiosis so that all chromosomes consist
of two sister chromatids

Â  Â Â 
Meiosis is preceded by interphase, during which DNA is replicated (in
the S phase) to produce two genetically identical copies

-   The two identical DNA molecules are identified as sister chromatids,
    and are held together by a single centromere
-   The sister chromatids are separated during meiosis II, following the
    separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I

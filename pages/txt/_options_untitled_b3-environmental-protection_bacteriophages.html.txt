Understanding:

â€¢ Â Bacteriophages are used in the disinfection of water systems

Â  Â Â 
Biofilms will often form within the pipes of water systems â€“
contaminating the supply, clogging the pipe and causing corrosion

-   The biofilms are difficult to remove using disinfectants and
    antimicrobial drugs, as they are highly resistant to these agents

Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically target bacteria, and are
commonly used in the disinfection of water systems

-   Bacteriophages may quickly spread through all bacterial cells and
    disrupt the coordinated maintenance of the biofilm
-   The virus will propagate within the bacterial cell and cause it to
    lyse as part of its viral life cycle

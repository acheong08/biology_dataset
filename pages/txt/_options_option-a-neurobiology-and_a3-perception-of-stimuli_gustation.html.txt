Gustation

Gustation describes the detection of taste by chemoreceptors in the oral
cavity (predominantly on the tongue)

-   The tongue is covered by thousands of small bumps called papillae,
    which each contain hundreds of taste buds
-   Each taste bud consists of many specialised sensory cells (gustatory
    epithelial cells), which detect chemicals in the mouth
-   The gustatory cells are not neurons, but will release
    neurotransmitters upon stimulation to activate neural pathways

The perception of taste by gustatory cells is limited, but can be
expanded by olfactory information (smells)

-   This is why food may taste comparatively flavourless when an
    individual has a virus or cold

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Learned behaviour develops as a result of experience

â€¢ Â Learning is the acquisition of skills or knowledge

Â  Â Â 
Learned behaviour is not developmentally fixed and can be modified by
experience

-   Learned behaviour shows significant variation as it is influenced by
    environmental context

Learning involves acquiring information from past experiences to adapt
to new situations

-   The capacity to learn particular skills may be influenced by genes,
    but will not develop without appropriate experiences
-   Learning improves an organismâ€™s survival prospects as they can
    modify their responses to changing environmental conditions

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Imprinting is learning occurring at a particular life stage and is
independent of the consequences of behaviour

Â  Â Â 
Imprinting is any kind of phase-sensitive learning that is rapid and
independent of behavioural consequences

-   Imprinting occurs during a short critical period in which the
    organism adopts behavioural characteristics from a stimulus
-   Imprinted behaviour is not influenced by consequences â€“ it does
    not require reinforcement to develop

Examples of imprinting include filial imprinting (bonding to a parent)
and sexual imprinting (developing sexual preferences)

-   Filial imprinting was demonstrated by Konrad Lorenz, who imprinted
    baby geese to recognise him as a parental figure

The Pupil Reflex

The pupil reflex is an involuntary response originating at the brainstem
and under the control of the autonomic nervous system

-   It involves the resizing of the iris to regulate the amount of light
    that reaches the retina (excess light can damage the retina)

Pupils constrict in bright light (to prevent overstimulation of
photoreceptors) and dilate in dim light (to maximise light exposure)

-   In bright light, parasympathetic nerves trigger circular muscles to
    contract and cause the pupils to constrict
-   In dim light, sympathetic nerves trigger radial muscles to contract
    and cause the pupils to dilate

Brain Death

Brain death is defined as the permanent absence of measurable activity
in both the cerebrum and brainstem

-   The brainstem is responsible for involuntary autonomic responses and
    may function alone to maintain homeostasis
-   Hence, individuals with a non-functioning cerebrum but a functioning
    brainstem may be kept alive in a vegetative state

Brain death can be determined by medical professionals by testing the
function of specific autonomic responses

-   The pupil reflex is one autonomic test used to assess brain death
    â€“ brain dead individuals will not exhibit a pupil reflex
-   The Glasgow Coma Scale uses multiple tests to determine the
    neurological health of someone with suspected brain injury

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A karyogram shows the chromosomes of an organism in homologous
pairs of decreasing length

Â  Â Â 
Karyotypes are the number and types of chromosomes in a eukaryotic cell
â€“ they are determined via a process that involves:

-   Harvesting cells (usually from a foetus or white blood cells of
    adults)
-   Chemically inducing cell division, then arresting mitosis while the
    chromosomes are condensed
-   The stage during which mitosis is halted will determine whether
    chromosomes appear with sister chromatids or not

The chromosomes are stained and photographed to generate a visual
profile that is known as a karyogram

-   The chromosomes of an organism are arranged into homologous pairs
    according to size (with sex chromosomes shown last)

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of karyograms to deduce sex and diagnose Down syndrome in
humans

Â  Â Â 
Karyotyping will typically occur prenatally and is used to:

-   Determine the gender of the unborn child (via identification of the
    sex chromosomes)
-   Test for chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. aneuploidies or
    translocations)

Down syndrome is a condition whereby the individual has three copies of
chromosome 21 (i.e. trisomy 21)

-   It is caused by a non-disjunction event in one of the parental
    gametes
-   The extra genetic material causes mental and physical delays in the
    way the child develops

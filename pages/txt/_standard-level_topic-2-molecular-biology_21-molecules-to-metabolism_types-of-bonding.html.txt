Types of Bonding

Atoms always try to have a full outer shell of electrons - in order to
achieve this they will bond with other atoms

When atoms bond together they form molecules - those made of one type of
atom are elements while those made of many types are compounds

Intramolecular Bonds

Atoms may join together by gaining and losing electrons (ionic bonding)
or by sharing electrons (covalent bonding)
Ionic Bonds:

-   Ionic bonding occurs between a metal and a non-metal
-   The metal has a nearly empty outer shell and so loses electrons to
    form a positively charged cation
-   The non-metal has a nearly full outer shell and so gains electrons
    to form a negatively charged anion
-   The resulting charge of these two ions creates a strong
    electrostatic attraction between them - an ionic bond

Covalent Bonds:

-   Covalent bonding occurs between two non-metals
-   Because both atoms have a large number of electrons in their outer
    shell, it is not feasible to lose or gain so many and so they share
-   The number of covalent bonds able to be formed reflects the number
    of missing electrons from the outer shell (e.g. carbon needs four
    electrons and so can form four covalent bonds)
-   Because there is no ionic charge, covalent molecules are not as
    strongly attracted to each other as ionic molecules (covalent bonds
    are weaker)

Intermolecular Bonds

Atoms from one molecule may attract atoms from another molecule â€“
these bonds are much weaker than intramolecular bonds
Hydrogen Bonds:

-   The covalent sharing of electrons between atoms may not always be
    equal and will depend on:
    -   The number of protons in an atom (more protons equals a greater
        attraction for electrons)
    -   The number of electron shells in an atom (electrons at a further
        distance from the nucleus are less attracted to nucleus)
-   Atoms that have a stronger affinity for electrons are said to have a
    higher electronegativity
-   Covalently shared electrons will orbit closer to atoms with a higher
    electronegativity, resulting in a slight charge differenceÂ 
-   These molecules are polar and can form weak electrostatic
    associations with other polar molecules
-   Polar associations between an H atom of one molecule and an F, O or
    N atom of another molecule are called hydrogen bonds

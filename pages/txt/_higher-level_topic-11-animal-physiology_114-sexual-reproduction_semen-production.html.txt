Semen Production

Semen is a fluid secreted by the male gonads and functions as a
transport medium for spermatozoa

-   There are three main components of the male reproductive system that
    are responsible for the production of semenÂ 

Epididymis

-   The epididymis functions to concentrate sperm that is produced in
    the seminiferous tubules by removing testicular fluids
-   The epididymis also serves as the location where sperm mature and
    develop a capacity toÂ â€˜swimâ€™

Seminal Vesicle

-   The seminal vesicle adds nutrients (including fructose), which
    provide the energy needed for the sperm toÂ â€˜swim'
-   It also secretes prostaglandins, which trigger uterine contractions
    that help move the sperm towards the egg

Prostate Gland

-   The prostate gland secretes alkaline fluids which help to neutralise
    vaginal acids
-   A localised pH change from (roughly) 4 to 6 functions to assist
    sperm motility

Structures Contributing to Semen Production

Male Sex Hormones

The production of sperm (and as a consequence, semen) is controlled by
three key hormones â€“ FSH, LH and testosterone

-   FSH and LH are produced by the brain (anterior pituitary), whereas
    testosterone is produced by interstitial (Leydig) cells

FSH

-   Initiates spermatogenesis by triggering the first meiotic division
    of spermatocytes
-   Also activates Sertoli cells, which provide nourishment for cells
    undergoing spermatogenesis

LH

-   Triggers the production of testosterone by Leydig cells in the
    interstitial tissue

Testosterone

-   Completes spermatogenesis by triggering the second meiotic division
    of spermatocytes
-   Stimulates the differentiation of spermatids to form mature
    spermatozoa

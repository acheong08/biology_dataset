Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some regions of DNA do not code for proteins but have other
important functions

Â  Â Â 
The vast majority of the human genome is comprised of non-coding DNA
(genes only account for ~ 1.5% of the total sequence)

-   Historically referred to asÂ â€˜junk DNAâ€™,Â these non-coding
    regions are now recognised to serve other important functions
-   Examples include satellite DNA, telomeres, introns, ncRNA genes and
    gene regulatory sequencesÂ

Application:

â€¢ Â Tandem repeats are used in DNA profiling

Â  Â Â 
DNA profiling is a technique by which individuals can be identified and
compared via their respective DNA profiles

-   Within the non-coding regions of an individualâ€™s genome there
    exists satellite DNA â€“ long stretches of DNA made up of repeating
    elements calledÂ short tandem repeatsÂ (STRs)Â 
-   Tandem repeats can be excised using restriction enzymes and then
    separated withÂ gel electrophoresis for comparison
-   As individuals will likely have different numbers of repeats at a
    given satellite DNA locus, they will generate unique DNA profiles
    -   Longer repeats will generate larger fragments, while shorter
        repeats will generate smaller fragments

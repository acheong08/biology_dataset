Understanding:

â€¢ Â Reproductive isolation of populations can be temporal, behavioural
or geographic

Â  Â Â 
Reproductive isolation occurs when barriers prevent two populations from
interbreeding â€“ keeping their gene pools separate

There are two main categories of reproductive isolation barriers:

-   Prezygotic isolation â€“ occurs before fertilisation can occur (no
    offspring are produced)
-   Postzygotic isolation â€“ occurs after fertilisation (offspring are
    either not viable or infertile)

Prezygotic isolation barriers can be temporal, behavioural, geographic /
ecological or mechanical; whereas postzygotic isolation barriers include
the inviability, infertility or breakdown of hybrid organisms

Reproductive Isolation Mechanisms

[reproductive isolation]

Temporal Isolation

-   Temporal isolation occurs when two populations differ in their
    periods of activity or reproductive cycles
-   Example: Â Leopard frogs and wood frogs reach sexual maturity at
    different times in the spring and hence cannot interbreed

Behavioural Isolation

-   Behavioural isolation occurs when two populations exhibit different
    specific courtship patterns
-   Example: Â Certain populations of crickets may be morphologically
    identical but only respond toÂ specific mating songs

Geographic Isolation

-   Geographic isolation occurs when two populations occupy different
    habitats or separate niches within a common region
-   Example: Â Lions and tigers occupy different habitats and do not
    interbreed (usually)

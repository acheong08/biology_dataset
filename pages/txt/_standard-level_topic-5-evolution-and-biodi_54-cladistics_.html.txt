5.4 Â Cladistics

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The ancestry of groups of species can be deduced
by comparing their base or amino acid sequences

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   A clade is a group of organisms that have evolved from a common
    ancestor
-   Cladograms are tree diagrams that show the most probable sequence of
    divergence in clades
-   Evidence for which species are part of a clade can be obtained from
    the base sequence of a gene or the corresponding amino acid sequence
    of a protein
-   Sequence differences accumulate gradually so there is a positive
    correlation between the number of differences between two species
    and the time since they diverged from a common ancestor
-   Traits can be analogous or homologous
-   Evidence from cladistics has shown that classification of some
    groups based on structure did not correspond with the evolutionary
    origins of a group or species

Applications:

-   Cladograms including humans and other primates
-   Reclassification of the figwort family using evidence from
    cladistics

Skills:

-   Analysis of cladograms to deduce evolutionary relationships

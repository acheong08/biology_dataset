Application:

â€¢ Â tRNA-activating enzymes illustrate enzyme-substrate specificity
and the role of phosphorylation

Â  Â Â 
Each tRNA molecule binds with a specific amino acid in the cytoplasm in
a reaction catalysed by a tRNA-activating enzyme

-   Each amino acid is recognised by a specific enzyme (the enzyme may
    recognise multiple tRNA molecules due to degeneracy)

The binding of an amino acid to the tRNA acceptor stem occurs as a
result of a two-step process:

-   The enzyme binds ATP to the amino acid to form an amino acidâ€“AMP
    complex linked by a high energy bond (PP released)
-   The amino acid is then coupled to tRNA and the AMP is released â€“
    the tRNA molecule is nowÂ â€œchargedâ€?Â and ready for use

The function of the ATP (phosphorylation) is to create a high energy
bond that is transferred to the tRNA molecule

-   This stored energy will provide the majority of the energy required
    for peptide bond formation during translation

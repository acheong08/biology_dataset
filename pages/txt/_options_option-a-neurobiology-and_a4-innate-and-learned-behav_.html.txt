A4 Â Innate and Learned Behaviour

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Behavioural patterns can
be inherited or learned

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Innate behaviour is inherited from parents and so develops
    independently of the environment
-   Autonomic and involuntary responses are referred to as reflexes
-   Reflex arcs comprise the neurons that mediate reflexes
-   Reflex conditioning involves forming new associations
-   Learned behaviour develops as a result of experience
-   Imprinting is learning occurring at a particular life stage and is
    independent of the consequences of behaviour
-   Operant conditioning is a form of learning that consists of trial
    and error experiences
-   Learning is the acquisition of skill or knowledge
-   Memory is the process of encoding, storing and accessing information

Applications:

-   Withdrawal reflex of the hand from a painful stimulus
-   Pavlovâ€™s experiments into reflex conditioning in dogs
-   The role of inheritance and learning in the development of birdsong

Skills:

-   Analysis of data from invertebrate behaviour experiments in terms of
    the effect on chances of survival and reproduction
-   Drawing and labelling a diagram of a reflex arc for a pain
    withdrawal reflex

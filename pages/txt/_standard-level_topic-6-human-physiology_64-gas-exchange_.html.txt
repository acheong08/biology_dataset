6.4 Â Gas Exchange

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The lungs are actively ventilatedÂ to ensure
that gas exchange can occur passively

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Ventilation maintains concentration gradients of oxygen and carbon
    dioxide between air in alveoli and blood flowing in adjacent
    capillaries
-   Air is carried to the lungs in the trachea and bronchi and then to
    the alveoli in bronchioles
-   Type I pneumocytes are extremely thin alveolar cells that are
    adapted to carry out gas exchange
-   Type II pneumocytes secrete a solution containing surfactant that
    creates a moist surface inside the alveoli to prevent the sides of
    the alveolus adhering to each other by reducing surface tension
-   Muscle contractions cause the pressure changes inside the thorax
    that force air in and out of the lungs to ventilate them
-   Different muscles are required for inspiration and expiration
    because muscles only do work when they contract

Applications:

-   Causes and consequences of lung cancer
-   Causes and consequences of emphysema
-   External and internal intercostal muscles, and diaphragm and
    abdominal muscles as examples of antagonistic muscle action

Skill:

-   Monitoring of ventilation in humans at rest and after mild and
    vigorous exercise

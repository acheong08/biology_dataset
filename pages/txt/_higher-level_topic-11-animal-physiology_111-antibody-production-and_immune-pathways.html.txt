Immune Pathways

The adaptive immune system is comprised of two interrelated immune
pathways â€“Â humoral and cell-mediated immunity

-   Both pathways involve elements of the innate immune system to
    coordinate their respective immune reactions

Humoral Immunity

Humoral immunity describes the pathway by which antibodies are produced
by B lymphocytes to target exogenous antigens

-   When macrophages engulf exogenous pathogens, they digest them within
    lysosomes to release antigenic fragments
-   These fragments are presented on special surface receptors (MHC
    class II) that denote the material as being foreign
-   The antigens are presented to helper T cells, which in turn secrete
    cytokines to activate the appropriate B lymphocytes
-   The specific B lymphocytes divide and differentiate (clonal
    selection) to form antibody producing plasma cells

Cell-mediated Immunity

Cell-mediated immunity describes a pathway that does not result in
antigen production but instead targets endogenous antigens

-   Cancerous and virus-infected cells involve the bodyâ€™s own cells
    and thus are not recognised as foreign, evading normal detection
-   These cells may instead present antigenic fragments as a complex
    with their own self markers (MHC class I)
-   When helper T cells identify these cells, they stimulate a second
    type of T lymphocyte â€“ cytotoxic T cells (T_(C) cells)
-   Cytotoxic T cells show specificity to particular antigens and will
    bind to the presented antigen and release perforating enzymes
-   These enzymes cause the infected / cancerous cell to by lysed,
    preventing the further spread of infection
-   Virus infected cells can also be destroyed non-specifically by NK
    cells, which respond to interferon released by the infected cell

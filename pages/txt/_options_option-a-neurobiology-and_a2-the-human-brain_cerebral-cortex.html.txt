Understanding:

â€¢ Â The cerebral cortex forms a larger proportion of the brain and is
more highly developed in humans than

Â  Â Â other animals

Â  Â Â 
The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of neural tissue found in the
cerebrum of humans and other mammals

-   It is composed ofÂ grey matter and is involved in complex actions,
    such as memory, perception, consciousness and thought

The cerebral cortex is much more highly developed in humans than other
animals and forms aÂ larger proportion of the brain

-   The cerebral cortex can be externally classified according to four
    topographical lobes â€“ frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The human cerebral cortex has become enlarged principally by an
increase in total area with extensive

Â  Â Â folding to accommodate it within the cranium

Â  Â Â 
Through evolution, the human cerebral cortex has been greatly enlarged
in comparison to other brain structures

-   The disproportional enlargement of the cerebral cortex in humans is
    responsible for our capacity for cognitive thought

The increase in total area is mediated by extensive folding
(gyrification) to form wrinkled peaks (gyrus) and troughs (sulcus)

-   This greatly increases surface area without increasing volume â€“
    allowing the brain to fit within the cranium

The extent of gyrification of the cerebral cortex is a reliable
indicator of potential cognitive capacity

-   Primates and humans have a greater degree of folding compared to
    lower mammals (e.g. rats have a smooth cortex)

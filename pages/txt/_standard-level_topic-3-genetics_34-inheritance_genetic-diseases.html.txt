Understanding:

â€¢ Â Many genetic diseases in humans are due to recessive alleles of
autosomal genes, although some geneticÂ 

Â  Â diseases are due to dominant or co-dominant alleles

Â  Â Â 
Genetic diseases are caused when mutations to a gene (or genes) abrogate
normal cellular function, leading to the development of a disease
phenotype

-   Genetic diseases can be caused by recessive, dominant or co-dominant
    alleles

An autosomal recessive genetic disease will only occur if both alleles
are faulty

-   Heterozygous individuals will possess one copy of the faulty allele
    but not develop disease symptoms (they are carriers)
-   An example of an autosomal recessive genetic disease is cystic
    fibrosis

An autosomal dominant genetic disease only requires one copy of a faulty
allele to cause the disorder

-   Homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals will both develop
    the full range of disease symptoms
-   An example of an autosomal dominant genetic disease is
    Huntingtonâ€™s disease

If a genetic disease is caused by co-dominant alleles it will also only
require one copy of the faulty allele to occur

-   However, heterozygous individuals will have milder symptoms due to
    the moderating influence of a normal allele
-   An example of a genetic disease that displays co-dominance is sickle
    cell anaemia

Inheritance Patterns for Dominant and Recessive Genetic Disorders

Application:

â€¢ Â Inheritance of cystic fibrosis and Huntingtonâ€™s disease

Â  Â Â 
Cystic Fibrosis

-   Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a
    mutation to the CFTR gene on chromosome 7
-   Individuals with cystic fibrosis produce mucus which is unusually
    thick and sticky
-   This mucus clogs the airways and secretory ducts of the digestive
    system, leading to respiratory failure and pancreatic cysts
-   Heterozygous carriers who possess one normal allele will not develop
    disease symptoms

Huntingtonâ€™s Disease

-   Huntingtonâ€™s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a
    mutation to the Huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4
-   The HTT gene possesses a repeating trinucleotide sequence (CAG) that
    is usually present in low amounts (10 â€“ 25 repeats)
-   More than 28 CAG repeats is unstable and causes the sequence to
    amplify (produce even more repeats)
-   When the number of repeats exceeds ~40, the huntingtin protein will
    misfold and cause neurodegeneration
-   This usually occurs in late adulthood and so symptoms usually
    develop noticeably in a personâ€™s middle age (~40 years)Â 
-   Symptoms of Huntingtonâ€™s disease include uncontrollable, spasmodic
    movements (chorea) and dementia

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Many genetic diseases have been identified in humans but most are
very rare

Â  Â Â 
There are over 4,000 identified single gene defects that lead to genetic
disease, but most are very rare

-   Any allele that adversely affects survival and hence the capacity to
    reproduce is unlikely to be passed on to offspring

Recessive conditions tend to be more common, as the faulty allele can be
present in carriers without causing disease

Dominant conditions may often have a late onset, as this does not
prevent reproduction and the transfer of the faulty allele

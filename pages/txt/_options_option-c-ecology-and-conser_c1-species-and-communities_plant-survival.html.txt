Plant Survival

There are a number of limiting factors that affect the distribution of
plant species within a community

-   These include temperature, water and light availability, salinity
    and edaphic factors (soil pH and nutrient levels)

Temperature

-   Plants can only survive within a narrow range of temperatures to
    which they are adapted
-   High temperatures will increase the rate of water loss by
    evaporation and may also denature metabolic enzymes
-   Low temperatures may cause plant sap to freeze (the expansion of
    frozen water in the xylem can cause trunks to split)
-   Certain species of woody plants (e.g. maple trees) synthesise
    antifreeze protein to prevent crystal formation in frozen cells

Water Availability

-   Water is needed for photosynthetic processes and is also necessary
    for maintaining cell turgor
-   Xerophytes (e.g. cacti) are plant species that are adapted to
    survive in dry and arid environments â€“ such as deserts
-   HydrophytesÂ (e.g. rice) are plant species that are adapted to
    survive in frequently waterlogged soilsÂ 

Light Availability

-   Light is essential to the process of photosynthesis â€“ whereby
    plants produce organic molecules
-   Low-growing plants will typically possess darker green leaves (more
    chlorophyll) in order to optimise their light conversion
-   Certain seaweeds (e.g. kelp) have pigments adapted to absorbing blue
    wavelengths (red does not easily penetrate water)

Salinity

-   Most plants have a low soil salinity tolerance and can only exist
    within a narrow range of salinity
-   High salinity may be toxic to plants and makes the uptake of water
    via osmosis more difficult
-   Halophytes (e.g. mangroves) are plant species that are adapted to
    tolerate high levels of salinity

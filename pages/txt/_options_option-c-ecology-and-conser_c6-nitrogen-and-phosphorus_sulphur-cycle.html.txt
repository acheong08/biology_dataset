Sulphur Cycle

The sulphur cycle outlines how different forms of sulphur are cycled
Â within the environment

-   Sulphur is an essential component of living organisms, being a
    constituent part of many proteins and enzyme cofactors
-   Sulphur in the air and soil may be oxidised to form sulphates
    (SO₄^(2â€“))
-   Sulphates are reduced by plants and bacteria and hence sulphur
    becomes incorporated into organic molecules
-   Sulphur within the soil can also be mineralised into inorganic forms
    and incorporated with metals (e.g. ironÂ sulphide)
-   Burning of fossil fuels releases sulphur as sulphur dioxide (SO₂),
    which is an enabling component of acid rain

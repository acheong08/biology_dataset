Understanding:

â€¢ Â Databases allow scientists easy access to information

â€¢ Â The body of data stored in databases is increasing exponentially

Â  Â Â 
Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that uses computer science
to sort, store and understand biological data

-   This information is stored in databases, which use algorithms to
    collate relevant data for interpretation and analysis

The body of available data stored in databases is increasing
exponentially as a result of:

-   Advancements in sequencing protocols (promotes faster data
    collection)Â 
-   Development of new software tools (results in easier access to data
    â€“ which promotes collaboration)
-   A rapid increase in the number of labs undertaking associated
    researchÂ 

Examples of databases used to collect and collect relevant biological
information include:

-   Genbank â€“ Genetic sequence database
-   RCSB â€“ Protein database
-   EBI â€“ Molecular biology database (genes, proteins and chemicals)

Application:

â€¢ Â Explore chromosome 21 in databases (for example inÂ Ensembl)

Â  Â Â 
Chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome, with roughly 48 million
base pairs

-   It was the second chromosome to be completely sequenced as part of
    the Human Genome Project
-   Chromosome 21 is predicted to contain roughly 400 â€“ 600 genes
    (number varies according to predictive measure used)

Information regarding the structure and approximate sequence of
chromosome 21 is stored in bioinformatic databases

-   This information is commonly conveyed as an ideogram (a graphical
    representation of chromosomal content)

Chromosome 21 can be explored in a number of different databases,
including NCBI and Ensembl

Extracellular Matrix

The extracellular matrix is a mesh of protein fibres and glycoproteins
that exist externally of the cell in multicellular organisms

The extracellular matrix (ECM) typically provides structural and
biochemical support to surrounding cells, including:

-   Providing sites for anchorage by cells within a tissue and
    segregating separate tissues from one another
-   Sequestering and storing growth factors until receipt of a chemical
    signal (thereby regulating intercellular communication)

In plant cells the extracellular matrix includes cell wall components
(likeÂ cellulose) and hence plays an important role in:Â 

-   Regulating water uptake (maintainence of cell turgor)Â 
-   Providing mechanical strength and rigidity to the cell (maintains
    cell shape)

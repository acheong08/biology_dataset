2.5 Â Enzymes

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Enzymes control the
metabolism of the cell

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Enzymes have an active site to which specific substrates bind
-   Enzyme catalysis involves molecular motion and the collision of
    substrates with the active site
-   Temperature, pH and substrate concentration affect the rate of
    activity of enzymes
-   Enzymes can be denatured
-   Immobilized enzymes are widely used in industry

Applications:

-   Methods of production of lactose-free milk and its advantages

Skills:

-   Design of experiments to test the effect of temperature, pH and
    substrate concentration on the activity of enzymes
-   Experimental investigation of a factor affecting enzyme activity

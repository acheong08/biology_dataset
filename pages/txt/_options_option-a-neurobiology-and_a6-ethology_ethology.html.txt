Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ethology is the study of animal behaviour in natural conditions

Â  Â Â 
Ethology is the scientific study of animal behaviour under natural
conditions (i.e. observational not experimental)

-   As it is a biological perspective, behaviour is considered to be an
    evolutionary adaptive trait developed via natural selection

The modern field of ethology includes a number of well-known
investigations into animal behaviour:

-   Migratory patterns in birds (such as blackcaps)
-   Reciprical altruism in animal species (such as vampire bats)
-   Breeding and courtship strategies in a number of different animals

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural selection can change the frequency of observed animal
behaviour

â€¢ Â Behaviour that increases the chances of survival and reproduction
become more prevalent in a population

Â  Â Â 
Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution by which the frequency of
inherited traits change as a result of external agents

-   Characteristics which promote survival and reproduction (i.e.
    beneficial alleles) become more prevalent in a population

Any behaviour that has a genetic basis (i.e. innate) and confers
reproductive success will become more common

-   Learned behaviours may also evolve via natural selection if the
    capacity for learning has a genetic basis (e.g. language)

Natural selection will promoteÂ â€œoptimalâ€?Â behaviours for the given
set of environmental conditions in which the organism lives

-   As these external conditions change, the frequency of certain
    behavioural responses will vary accordingly

An example of the evolution of behaviour via natural selection can be
demonstrated by the feeding habits of fledgling birds

-   Within a nest, baby birds (chicks) will gape andÂ chirp as
    fledglings in order to be fed by their parents
-   The chicks that chirp louder and gape more obviously are more likely
    to receive parental attention and be fed more
-   These chicks are more likely to survive and pass their alleles for
    chirping and gaping on to their offspring
-   Over many generations, the frequency of excessively overt chirping
    and gaping behaviours has increased

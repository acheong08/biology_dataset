Application:

â€¢ Â Endorphins can act as painkillers

Â  Â Â 
Endorphins are endogenous neuropeptides produced by the pituitary gland
that functions as the bodyâ€™s natural painkiller

-   Endorphins are typically released by the body during periods of
    stress, injury or physical exercise

Pain is perceived in body tissues when impulses are sent from pain
receptors (nocireceptors) to sensory areas of the brain

-   Endorphins bind to opiate receptors on pre-synaptic neurons to block
    the transmission of pain signals

Endorphins differ from anesthetics in that they reduce pain perception
but do not necessarily block all sensory perception

-   Endorphins can also promote feelings of euphoria (as they target
    opioid receptors)

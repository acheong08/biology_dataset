Understanding:

â€¢ Â Neurons transmit electrical impulses

Â 
Neurons are specialised cells that function to transmit electrical
impulses within the nervous system

-   The nervous system converts sensory information into electrical
    impulses in order to rapidly detect and respond to stimuli

While neurons may differ according to role (sensory, relay or motor),
most share three basic components:

-   Dendrites â€“ Short-branched fibres that convert chemical
    information from other neurons or receptor cells into electrical
    signals
-   Axon â€“ An elongated fibre that transmits electrical signals to
    terminal regions for communication with other neurons or effectors
-   Soma â€“ A cell body containing the nucleus and organelles, where
    essential metabolic processes occur to maintain cell survival

In someÂ neurons, the axon may be surrounded by an insulating layer
known as a myelin sheath

-   The myelin sheath improves the conduction speed of electrical
    impulses along the axon, but require additional space and energy

Cell Scale

Cells and their components are measured according to the metric system:

.[metric system]

Relative Sizes of Biological Materials

-   Eukaryotic cell (plant) = ~100Â Î¼m
-   Eukaryotic cell (animal) = ~10 â€“ 50Â Î¼m
-   Organelle (e.g. mitochondrion) = ~1 â€“ 10Â Î¼m
-   Prokaryotic cell (bacteria) = ~1 â€“ 5Â Î¼m
-   Virus = ~100 nm
-   Plasma membrane = ~7.5 nm
-   Molecules (e.g. glucose) = ~1 nm
-   Atoms = ~100 pm

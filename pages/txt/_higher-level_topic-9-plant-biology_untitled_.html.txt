9.2 Â Transport in the Phloem of Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Structure and function are Â 
correlated in the phloem of plants

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Plants transport organic compounds from sources to sinks
-   Active transport is used to load organic compounds into phloem sieve
    tubes at the source
-   High concentrations of solutes in the phloem at the source lead to
    water uptake by osmosis
-   Incompressibility of water allows transport along hydrostatic
    pressure gradients
-   Raised hydrostatic pressure causes the contents of the phloem to
    flow towards sinks

Applications:

-   Structure-function relationships of phloem sieve tubes

Skills:

-   Identification of xylem and phloem in microscope images of stem and
    root
-   Analysis of data from experiments measuring phloem transport rates
    using aphid stylets and radioactively-labelled carbon dioxide

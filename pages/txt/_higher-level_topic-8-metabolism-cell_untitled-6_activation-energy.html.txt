Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes lower the activation energy of the chemical reactions that
they catalyse

Â  Â Â 
Every chemical reaction requires a certain amount of energy in order to
proceed â€“ this is the activation energy (E_(A))

-   Enzymes speed up the rate of a biochemical reaction by lowering the
    activation energy
-   When an enzyme binds to a substrate it stresses and destabilises the
    bonds in the substrate
-   This reduces the overall energy level of the substrateâ€™s
    transitionary state, meaning less energy is needed to convert it
    into a product and the reaction proceeds at a faster rate

Types of Enzymatic Reactions

If the reactants contain more energy than the products, the free energy
is released into the system (exergonic)

-   These reactions are usually catabolic (breaking down), as energy is
    released from broken bonds within a molecule

If the reactants contain less energy than the products, free energy is
lost to the system (endergonic)

-   These reactions are usually anabolic (building up), as energy is
    required to synthesise bonds between molecules

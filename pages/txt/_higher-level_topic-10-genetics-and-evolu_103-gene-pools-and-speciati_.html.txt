10.3 Â Gene Pools and Speciation

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Gene pools change over time

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   A gene pool consists of all the genes and their different alleles,
    present in an interbreeding population
-   Evolution requires that allele frequencies change with time in
    populations
-   Reproductive isolation of populations can be temporal, behavioural
    or geographic
-   Speciation due to divergence of isolated populations can be gradual
-   Speciation can occur abruptly

Applications:

-   Identifying examples of directional, stabilising and disruptive
    selection
-   Speciation in the genus Allium by polyploidy

Skills:

-   Comparison of allele frequencies of geographically isolated
    populations

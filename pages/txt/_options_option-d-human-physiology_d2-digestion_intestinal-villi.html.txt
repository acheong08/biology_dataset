Understanding:

â€¢ Â The structure of cells of the epithelium of the villi is adapted
to the absorption of food

Â  Â Â 
Once digested food has passed through the stomach, it enters the small
intestine for absorption into the blood

-   The small intestine also releases digestive enzymes to ensure the
    complete hydrolysis of food molecules

The inner epithelial lining of the small intestine is highly folded into
finger-like projections called villi (singular: villus)

-   Many villi will protrude into the intestinal lumen, greatly
    increasing the available surface area for material absorption

Features of Villi

Intestinal villi contain several structural features which facilitate
the absorption of digestive products:
[Mr Slim]

-   MicrovilliÂ â€“ Ruffling of epithelial membrane further increases
    surface area
-   Rich blood supplyÂ â€“ Dense capillary network rapidly transports
    absorbed products
-   Single layer epitheliumÂ â€“ Minimises diffusion distance between
    lumen and blood
-   LactealsÂ â€“ Absorbs lipids from the intestine into the lymphatic
    system
-   Intestinal glandsÂ â€“ Exocrine pits (crypts of Lieberkuhn) release
    digestive juices
-   Membrane proteinsÂ â€“ Facilitates transport of digested materials
    into epithelial cells

â€¢ Â Identification of villus epithelium cells that absorb digested
food from electron micrographs

Â  Â Â 

The epithelial lining of villi contains several structural features
which optimise its capacity to absorb digested materials:
Tight Junctions

-   Occluding associations between the plasma membrane of two adjacent
    cells, creating an impermeable barrier
-   They keep digestive fluids separated from tissues and maintain a
    concentration gradient by ensuring one-way movementÂ 

Microvilli

-   Microvilli borders significantly increase surface area of the plasma
    membrane (>100Ã—), allowing for more absorption to occur
-   The membrane will be embedded with immobilised digestive enzymes and
    channel proteins to assist in material uptakeÂ 

Mitochondria

-   Epithelial cells of intestinal villi will possess large numbers of
    mitochondria to provide ATP for active transport mechanisms
-   ATP may be required for primary active transport (against gradient),
    secondary active transport (co-transport) or pinocytosis

Pinocytotic Vesicles

-   Pinocytosis (â€˜cell-drinkingâ€™) is the non-specific uptake of
    fluids and dissolved solutes (a quick way to translocate in bulk)
-   These materials will be ingested via the breaking and reforming of
    the membrane and hence contained within a vesicle

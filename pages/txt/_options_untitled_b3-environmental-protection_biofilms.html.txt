â€¢ Â Cooperative aggregates of microorganisms can form biofilms

â€¢ Â Microorganisms in biofilms cooperate through quorum sensing

Biofilm Formation

A biofilm is a cooperativeÂ aggregate of microorganisms associated with
a surface and enclosed in a polymeric matrix (â€˜slimeâ€™)

-   Biofilms can form on solid and liquid surfaces and may be composed
    of a single species or many species of microorganism

Biofilm formation begins with the attachment of microorganisms to a
surface through weak, reversibleÂ associations

-   If not removed, the microorganisms form more permanent, irreversible
    attachments using adhesion structures (such as pili)
-   The cells forming a monolayer will grow and divide, before producing
    an exopolymer matrix to enclose the developing colony

Biofilm Development

Quorum Sensing

As the biofilm develops, microorganisms will alter their gene expression
in response to changes in population density

-   This pattern of behaviour is called quorum sensing and is mediated
    by the release of chemicals from colony cells
-   Individual cells release inducer chemicals that will trigger
    specific transcriptional changes when a threshold is surpassed
-   As cells begin to aggregate, the concentration of inducer chemicals
    increases to exceed the required threshold
-   This triggers a synchronised change in gene expression, allowing the
    biofilm to operate as a coordinated system

Quorum sensing allows the biofilm to grow and develop in a manner that
is not uniform and promotes structural stability

-   Channels will form in order to facilitate the spread and
    incorporation of nutrients throughout the biofilm
-   Metabolic activity can create changes in the microenvironment,
    prompting the differential distribution of microorganisms
    -   For example, the establishment of an oxygen gradient will
        differentially localise aerobic and anaerobic metabolisers

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Biofilms possess emergent properties

â€¢ Â Microorganisms growing in a biofilm are highly resistant to
antimicrobial agents

Â  Â Â 
Emergent Properties

Through quorum sensing, microorganisms in a biofilm possess functions
beyond those that are present in an individual cell

-   The cooperative action of cells in the biofilm combine to create new
    synergistic effects (emergent properties)

One emergent property commonly identified in biofilms is an increased
resistance to antimicrobial agents

-   Within a biofilm, some microorganisms develop into non-dividing,
    slow-growing persister cells
-   These cells exist within a physiologically dormant state, which
    makes them insensitive to the action of antimicrobial drugs
-   Consequently, these cells survive antimicrobial treatments and
    function as a reserve from which the biofilm can repopulate
-   This renders antimicrobial drugs ineffective in the treatment of
    biofilms and associated diseasesÂ

Environmental Problems

Biofilms are ubiquitous in nature and will form on virtually any
non-shedding surface in a moist environment

-   Biofilms in streams form an important component of aquatic food
    chains and also filter sediments to maintain water quality
-   Microbial biofilms are actively involved in the decomposition of
    biotic debris and the recycling of nutrients
-   Biofilms may form on plant surfaces to form symbiotic relationships
    with the plant (e.g. nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots)
-   Alternatively, biofilms may form on plant surfaces to cause crop
    diseases (e.g. citrus canker is associated with biofilms)
-   Biofilms are present on the surface of animals (e.g. dental plaque
    on teeth) and may cause diseases when present internally
-   Biofilms can form on man-made structures such as faucets and sewage
    pipes, resulting in long-term corrosion
-   Biofilm adhesion to ship hulls serves as the foundation for
    biofouling on marine vessels
-   Biofilms can also serve constructive purposes, including in food
    preparation, bioremediation and sewage treatment

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ventilation maintains concentration gradients of oxygen and carbon
dioxide between air in alveoli and blood

Â  Â Â flowing in adjacent capillaries

Â  Â Â 
Physiological respiration involves the transport of oxygen to cells
within the tissues, where energy production occurs

-   It is comprised of three distinct processes and is not to be
    confused with cellular respiration (a single component of the
    activity)

The processes involved in physiological respiration are:

-   Ventilation: Â The exchange of air between the atmosphere and the
    lungs â€“ achieved by the physical act of breathing
-   Gas Exchange: Â The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between
    the alveoli and bloodstream (via passive diffusion)
-   Cell Respiration: Â The release of energy (ATP) from organic
    molecules â€“ it is enhanced by the presence of oxygen (aerobic)

Purpose of Ventilation

Because gas exchange is a passive process, a ventilation system is
needed to maintain a concentration gradient in alveoli

-   Oxygen is consumed by cells during cellular respiration and carbon
    dioxide is produced as a waste product
-   This means O₂ is constantly being removed from the alveoli into the
    bloodstream (and CO₂Â is continually being released)

The lungs function as a ventilation system by continually cycling fresh
air into the alveoli from the atmosphere

-   This means O₂ levels stay high in alveoli (and diffuse into the
    blood) and CO₂ levels stay low (and diffuse from theÂ blood)
-   The lungs are also structured to have a very large surface area, so
    as to increase the overall rate of gas exchange

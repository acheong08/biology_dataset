B3 Â Environmental Protection

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Biotechnology can be used in the prevention and mitigation of
contamination from industrial, agricultural and municipal wastes

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Responses to pollution incidents can involve bioremediation combined
    with physical and chemical procedures
-   Microorganisms are used in bioremediation
-   Some pollutants are metabolised by microorganisms
-   Cooperative aggregates of microorganisms can form biofilms
-   Microorganisms in biofilms cooperate through quorum sensing
-   Biofilms possess emergent properties
-   Microorganisms growing in a biofilm are highly resistant to
    antimicrobial agents
-   Bacteriophages are used in the disinfection of water systems

Applications:

-   Degradation of oil by Pseudomonas
-   Degradation of benzene by halophilic bacteria such as Marinobacter
-   Conversion by Pseudomonas of methyl mercury into elemental mercury
-   Use of biofilms in trickle filter beds for sewage treatment

Skills:

-   Evaluation of data or media reports on environmental problems caused
    by biofilms

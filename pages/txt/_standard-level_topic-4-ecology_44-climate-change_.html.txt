4.4 Â Climate Change

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Concentrations of gases in the atmosphereÂ 
affect climates experienced at the Earthâ€™s surface

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Carbon dioxide and water vapour are the most significant greenhouse
    gases
-   Other gases including methane and nitrogen oxides have less impact
-   The impact of a gas depends on its ability to absorb long wave
    radiation as well as on its concentration in the atmosphere
-   The warmed Earth emits longer wavelength radiation (heat)
-   Longer wave radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases that retain
    the heat in the atmosphere
-   Global temperatures and climate patterns are influenced by
    concentrations of greenhouse gases
-   There is a correlation between rising atmospheric concentrations of
    carbon dioxide since the start of the industrial revolution 200
    years ago and average global temperatures
-   Recent increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are largely due to
    increases in the combustion of fossilised organic matter

Applications:

-   Threats to coral reefs from increasing concentrations of dissolved
    carbon dioxide
-   Correlations between global temperatures and carbon dioxide
    concentrations on Earth
-   Evaluating claims that human activities are not causing climate
    change

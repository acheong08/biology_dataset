Understanding:

â€¢ Â hCG stimulates the ovary to secrete progesterone during early
pregnancy

Â  Â Â 
When a blastocyst becomes implanted in the endometrial lining it begins
to secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)

-   hCG promotes the maintenance of the corpusÂ luteum within the ovary
    and prevents its degeneration

As a consequence of this, the corpus luteum survives and continues to
produce both oestrogen and progesterone

-   Oestrogen inhibits FSH and LH production by the pituitary gland,
    preventing the release of more eggs from the ovaries
-   Progesterone also functions to maintain the endometrium (which is
    nourishing the embryo) and thicken the cervix

The levels of hCG are maintained for roughly 8 â€“ 10 weeks while the
placenta is being developed

-   After this time, the placenta becomes responsible for progesterone
    secretion and nourishing the embryo
-   At this point the corpus luteum is no longer required and begins to
    degenerate as hCG levels drop

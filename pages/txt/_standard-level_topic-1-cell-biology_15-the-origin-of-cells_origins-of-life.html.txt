Origins of Life

The initial formation of primitive living structures (protocells) is
thought to require a specific supporting chemical environment

-   Early Earth had a chemically-reducing atmosphere, which when exposed
    to energy in various forms (heat, electrical discharge, etc.)
    produced a variety of simple organic compounds (monomers)
-   These compounds accumulated in a molecularÂ â€˜soupâ€™, allowing for
    the formation of more complex compounds (polymers)

There are a number of locations posited as providing suitable conditions
for the formation of a concentrated chemical soup, including volcanoes,
hydrothermal vents, shorelines and outer space

Â 
1. Â Volcanoes

-   The gas composition of volcanic eruptions contain high levels of
    fixed nitrogen and other raw materials which could be used for
    primitive metabolism
-   Intensive volcanic activity could also generate sufficient thermal
    energy to catalyse the formation of organic molecules

2.Â Â Hydrothermal Vents

-   Hydrothermal vents are regions of the ocean floor where superheated
    water is released from the Earthâ€™s crust
-   These vents also release hydrogen-rich fluids to create a chemical
    gradient and pH viable for organic synthesis

3.Â  Shorelines

-   Organic life may have evolved at a sea shore or other region where
    there is an alternation of wet and dry conditions
-   The drying of clay particles could have precipitated catalysing
    reactions needed for the formation of organic molecules

4.Â  Extraterrestrial Origins

-   The necessary conditions required for the formation of life may have
    initially been derived on other planets (e.g. Mars)
-   Comets contain a variety of organic material (~20% of a cometâ€™s
    tail is comprised of organic matter)
-   Heavy meteorite bombardment approximately 4 billion years ago may
    have delivered organic material to the Earth
-   The theory that life on Earth was initially seeded in space or on
    another planet is called panspermia

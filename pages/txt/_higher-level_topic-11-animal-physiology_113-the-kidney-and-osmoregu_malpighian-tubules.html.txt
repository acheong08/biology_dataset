Understanding:

â€¢ Â The Malpighian tubule system in insects and the kidney carry out
osmoregulation and the removal of

Â  Â Â nitrogenous wastes

Â  Â Â 
All animals possess a specialised excretory system for osmoregulation
and the removal of nitrogenous wastes

-   In mammals, the excretory system (kidneys) is separate from the
    digestive system of the animal
-   In insects, the excretory system (Malpighian tubules) connects to
    the digestive system of the animal

Malpighian Tubules

-   Insects have a circulating fluid system called hemolymph that is
    analogous to the blood system in mammals
-   Malpighian tubules branch off from the intestinal tract and actively
    uptake nitrogenous wastes and water from the hemolymph
-   The tubules pass these materials into the gut to combine with the
    digested food products
-   Solutes, water and salts are reabsorbed into the hemolymph at
    theÂ hindgut, whereas nitrogenous wastes (as uric acid) and
    undigested food materials are excreted via the anus

Chloroplasts

Plants have evolved a specialised organelle responsible for
photosynthesis â€“ the chloroplast
The chloroplast contains membrane sacs (called thylakoids) arranged into
stacks (calledÂ grana)

-   These membrane sacs contain chlorophyll and are the site of the
    light dependent reactions

The surrounding fluid matrix is called theÂ stroma and contains carbon
fixating enzymes

-   This is the site of the light independent reactions

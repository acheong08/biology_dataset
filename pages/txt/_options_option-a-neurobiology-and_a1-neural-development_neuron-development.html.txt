Understanding:

â€¢ Â Neurons are initially produced by differentiation in the neural
tube

Â  Â Â 
The neural tube containsÂ multipotent neuronal stem cells which can
differentiate to form the different types of nerve cells:

-   Neurons are specialised nerve cells that conduct messages â€“ they
    can be sensory, motor or relay (interneurons)
-   Glial cells provide physical and nutritional support for the neurons
    â€“ roughly 90% of nerve cells in the brain are glial cells

Neurons are produced by progenitor neuroblasts via a process known as
neurogenesis

-   Most neurons survive for the lifetime of the individual and do not
    proliferate following embryogenesis (they are 'post-mitoticâ€™)
-   Certain brain regions may be capable of adult neurogenesis, but most
    of the nervous system is incapable of regeneration

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Immature neurons migrate to a final location

Â  Â Â 
Immature neurons must migrate in order to adopt precise final positions
that allow for the formation of neural circuitries

-   This migration process is critical for the development of brain and
    spinal architecture

Neural migration may occur via one of two distinct processes â€“ glial
guidance or somal translocation

-   Glial cells may provide a scaffolding network along which an
    immature neuron can be directed to its final location
-   Alternatively, the neuron may form an extension at the cellâ€™s
    perimeter and then translocate its soma along this length

Understanding:

â€¢ Â An axon grows from each immatureÂ neuron in response to chemical
stimuli

â€¢ Â Some axons extend beyond the neural tube to reach other parts of
the body

Â  Â Â 
An immature neuron consists of a cell body (soma) containing a nucleus
and cytoplasm

-   Axons and dendrites will grow from each immature neuron in response
    to chemical signals from surrounding cells
-   Some axons may be quite short (within the CNS) but others may extend
    to other parts of the body (within the PNS)

An axon has a growth cone at its tip that contains highly motile growth
filaments calledÂ filipodia

-   Extension of theseÂ filipodia causes the expansion of the internal
    cytoskeleton within the growth cone â€“ resulting in growth
-   The direction of this expansion is controlled by chemical stimuli
    released from surrounding cells
-   These cells may release chemoattractant signals (grow towards) or
    chemorepellant signals (grow away)
-   Using these molecular guidance signals, axonÂ growth cones may
    navigate long distances to reach specific targets

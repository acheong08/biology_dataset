2.9 Â Photosynthesis

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Photosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight
to produce the chemical energy needed for life

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Photosynthesis is the production of carbon compounds in cells using
    light energy
-   Visible light has a range of wavelengths with violet the shortest
    wavelength and red the longest
-   Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light most effectively and reflects
    green light more than other colours
-   Oxygen is produced in photosynthesis from the photolysis of water
-   Energy is needed to produce carbohydrates and other carbon compounds
    from carbon dioxide
-   Temperature, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration are
    possible limiting factors on the rate of photosynthesis

Applications:

-   Changes to the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, oceans and rock deposition due
    to photosynthesis

Skills:

-   Drawing an absorption spectrum for chlorophyll and an action
    spectrum for photosynthesis
-   Design of experiments to investigate the effect of limiting factors
    on photosynthesis
-   Separation of photosynthetic pigments by chromatograph

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Peat forms when organic matter is not fully decomposed because of
acidic and / or anaerobic conditions in

Â  Â  waterlogged soils

Â  Â Â 

[carbon fuels]

Partial Decomposition

In many soils, saprotrophic bacteria and fungi will decompose dead
organisms and return nutrients to the soil for cycling

-   This decomposition process requires oxygen (cell respiration is
    required to fuel digestive reactions)

Waterlogged regions may lack oxygenated air spaces within the soil and
thus possessÂ anaerobic conditions

-   Anaerobic respiration by organisms in these regions produces organic
    acids (e.g. acetate), resulting in acidic conditionsÂ 
-   Saprotrophic bacteria and fungi cannot function effectively in
    anaerobic / acidic conditions, preventing decomposition

Coal Formation

Since the organic matter is not fully decomposed in waterlogged soils,
carbon-rich molecules remain in the soil and form peat

-   When deposits of peat are compressed under sediments, the heat and
    pressure force out impurities and remove moisture
-   The remaining material has a high carbon concentration and undergoes
    a chemical transformation to produceÂ coal

How Coal is Formed

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Partially decomposed organic matter from past geological eras was
converted into either coal or into oil and gas

Â  Â  which accumulates in porous rocks

Â  Â Â 

Oil / Natural Gas Formation

Oil (i.e. petroleum) and natural gas form as the result of the decay of
marine organisms on the ocean floor

-   Sediments (e.g. clay and mud) are deposited on top of the organic
    matter, creating anoxic conditions that prevent decomposition
-   As a result of the burial and compaction, the organic material
    becomes heated and hydrocarbons are formed
-   The hydrocarbons form oil and gas, which are forced out of the
    source rock and accumulate in porous rocks (e.g. sandstone)

The formation of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) takes place over
millions of years, making them a non-renewable energy source

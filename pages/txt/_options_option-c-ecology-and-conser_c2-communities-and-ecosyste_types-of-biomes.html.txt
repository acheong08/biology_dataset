Types of Biomes

Biomes are geographical areas that have a particular climate and sustain
a specific community of flora and fauna

-   The total area where all living things are found (i.e. the totality
    of biomes) is called the biosphere

There are a number of different biomes that are recognised according to
their specific characteristics

-   These include forests and grasslands (tropical and temperate),
    tundras, deserts and mountain ranges

Tropical Rainforest

-   Hot climate (25ÂºC â€“ 30ÂºC) with very high levels of precipitation
    (> 250 cm per year)Â 
-   Has a large diversity in species and vegetation includes epiphytes,
    tall trees and undergrowth

Temperate Forest

-   Temperate forests (deciduous forests) have moderate temperatures and
    clear seasonal changes
-   They have a growing period of ~200 days during 4 â€“ 6 frost free
    months

Boreal Forest (Taiga)

-   Taigas (coniferous forests) are cold and icy (0ÂºC â€“ 15ÂºC) with a
    small amount of precipitation
-   Coniferous trees are densely packed and there is little variation in
    species

Tropical Grassland (Savannah)

-   Savannahs are warm (20ÂºC â€“ 30ÂºC) with medium amounts of
    moisture, although seasonal droughts are common
-   Trees are intermittent and widely spaced, with occasional fires
    preventing thicker vegetation from encroaching

Temperate Grassland

-   Temperate grasslands have moderate temperatures and moderate amounts
    of rainfall
-   Trees and shrubs are largely absent and grasses are the dominant
    vegetation

Mediterranean (Chaparrel)

-   Temperatures are moderate (15ÂºC â€“ 25ÂºC) with rainy winters and
    dry summers
-   Vegetation consists of dry woody shrubs that are quick to grow

Desert

-   Deserts have extreme temperature conditions (> 30ÂºC during day ; <
    0ÂºC at night) and very low precipitation
-   Dominant plant species are xerophytes which are adapted for water
    conservation (rainfall is < 30 cm per year)

Tundra

-   Tundras have freezing temperatures (< 0ÂºC) and very little
    precipitation
-   Vegetation is low growing (e.g. mosses), although perennial plants
    may grow during the summer

Mountain Ranges

-   Mountain ranges are found all over the world at high altitudes (>
    10,000 feet)
-   Temperatures are typically fairly low due to the altitude, although
    weather conditions may change rapidly

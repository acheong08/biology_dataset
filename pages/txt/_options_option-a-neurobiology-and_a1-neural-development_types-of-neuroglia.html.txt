Types of Neuroglia

There are two groups of cells that comprise the human nervous system â€“
neurons and neuroglia

-   Neurons transmit electrical signals around the body, while neuroglia
    function to provide nourishment and support

There are a number of different neuroglia within the central and
peripheral nervous systems

-   These different types of neuroglia play distinct functional roles in
    supporting the activity ofÂ neurons

Neuroglia in the CNS

There are four types of neuroglia found within the central nervous
system:

-   Astrocytes â€“ maintain the blood brain barrier and preserve the
    chemical environment by recycling ions and neurotransmitters
-   Oligodendrocytes â€“ myelinate axons in the central nervous system
    and provide an overall structural framework
-   Ependymal cells â€“ line ventricles (brain) and central canal
    (spine) and are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid
-   Microglia â€“ remove cell debris, wastes and pathogens via
    phagocytosis

Neuroglia in the PNS

There are two types of neuroglia found within the peripheral nervous
system:

-   Schwann cells â€“ myelinate axons in the peripheral nervous system
-   Satellite cells â€“ regulate nutrient and neurotransmitter levels
    around neurons in ganglia

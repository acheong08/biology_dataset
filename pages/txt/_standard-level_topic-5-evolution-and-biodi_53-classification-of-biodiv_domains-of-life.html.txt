â€¢ Â All organisms are classified into three domains

Â  Â Â 
Currently, all living organisms are classified into three domains:

-   Eukarya â€“ eukaryotic organisms that contain a membrane-bound
    nucleus (includes protist, plants, fungi and animals)
-   Archaea â€“ prokaryotic cells lacking a nucleus and consist of the
    extremophiles (e.g. methanogens, thermophiles, etc.)
-   Eubacteria â€“ prokaryotic cells lacking a nucleus and consist of
    the common pathogenic forms (e.g. E. coli, S. aureus, etc.)

Originally, the two prokaryotic domains were considered only as a single
kingdom (Monera), however biochemical differences were discovered
between the two groups which warranted their reclassification into
separate domains

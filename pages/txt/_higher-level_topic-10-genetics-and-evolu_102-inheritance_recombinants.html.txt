â€¢ Â Identification of recombinants in crosses involving two linked
genes

Â  Â Â 
Recombinants of linked genes are those combinations of genes not found
in the parents

-   Recombinants occur as a result of crossing over of genetic material
    during prophase I of meiosis
-   If linked genes become separated by a chiasma, there will be an
    exchange of alleles between the non-sister chromatids
-   This creates new allele combinations that are different to those of
    the parent

Identifying Recombinants from Genotype

[recombinant genotype]

The frequency of recombinant phenotypes within a population will
typically be lower than that ofÂ non-recombinant phenotypes

-   This is because crossing over is a random process and chiasmata do
    not form at the same locations with every meiotic division

The relative frequency of recombinant phenotypes will be dependent on
the distance between linked genes Â 

-   Recombination frequency between two linked genes will be greater
    when the genes are further apart on the chromosomeÂ 
-   This is because there are more possible locations where a chiasma
    could form between the genes

Recombinant phenotypes can be identified by performing a test cross
(crossing with a homozygous recessive for both traits)

Hepatic Lobules

The liver is composed of smaller histological structures called lobules,
which are roughly hexagonal in shape

-   Each lobule is surrounded by branches of the hepatic artery (provide
    oxygen) and the portal vein (provide nutrients)
-   These vessels drain into capillary-like structures called sinusoids,
    which exchange materials directly with the hepatocytes
-   The sinusoids drain into a central vein, which feeds deoxygenated
    blood into the hepatic vein
-   Hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported by vessels
    called canaliculi to bile ducts, which surround the lobule

Sinusoids

Sinusoids are a type of small blood vessel found in the liver that
perform a similar function to capillaries (material exchange)

-   Sinusoids have increased permeability, allowing larger molecules
    (e.g. plasma proteins) to enter and leave the bloodstreamÂ 

The increased permeability of sinusoids is important for liver function
and is due to a number of structural features:

-   The surrounding diaphragm (basement membrane) is incomplete or
    discontinuous in sinusoids (but not in capillaries)
-   The endothelial layer contains large intercellular gaps and fewer
    tight junctions (allowing for the passage of larger molecules)

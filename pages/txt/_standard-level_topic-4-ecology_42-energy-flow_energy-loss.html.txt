Understanding:

â€¢ Â Energy released from carbon compounds by respiration is used in
living organisms and converted to heat

Â  Â Â 
Energy stored in organic molecules (e.g. sugars and lipids) can be
released by cell respiration to produce ATP

-   This ATP is then used to fuel metabolic reactions required for
    growth and homeostasis
-   A by-product of these chemical reactions is heat (thermal energy),
    which is released from the organismÂ 

Not all energy stored in organic molecules is transferred via
heterotrophic feeding â€“ some of the chemical energy is lost by:

-   Being excreted as part of the organismâ€™s faeces
-   Remaining unconsumed as the uneaten portions of the food

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Living organisms cannot convert heat to other forms of energy

â€¢ Â Heat is lost from ecosystems

Â  Â Â 
The chemical energy produced by an organism can be converted into a
number of forms, including:

-   Kinetic energy (e.g. during muscular contractions)
-   Electrical energy (e.g. during the transmission of nerve impulses)
-   Light energy (e.g. producing bioluminescence)

All of these reactions are exothermic and release thermal energy (heat)
as a by-product

-   Living organisms cannot turn this heat into other forms of usable
    energy
-   This heat energy is released from the organism and is lost from the
    ecosystem (unlike nutrients, which are recycled)
-   Hence ecosystems require a continuous influx of energy from an
    external source (such as the sun)

Somatic vs Germline Mutations

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be classed as either somatic
or germ-line:

-   Somatic mutations â€“ occur in a single body cell and cannot be
    inherited (only tissues derived from mutated cell are affected)
-   Germline mutations â€“ occur in gametes and can be passed onto
    offspring (every cell in the entire organism will be affected)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Oxygen dissociation curves show the affinity of haemoglobin for
oxygen

Â  Â Â 
Oxygen is transported throughout the body in red blood cells, which
contain an oxygen-binding protein called haemoglobin

-   Haemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide chains, each with an
    iron-containing heme group that reversibly binds oxygen
-   As such, each haemoglobin can reversibly bind up to four oxygen
    molecules (Hb + 4O₂ = HbO₈)

As each O₂ molecule binds, it alters the conformation of haemoglobin,
making subsequent binding easier (cooperative binding)

-   This means haemoglobin will have a higher affinity for O₂ in
    oxygen-rich areas (like the lung), promoting oxygen loading
-   Conversely, haemoglobin will have a lower affinity for O₂ in
    oxygen-starved areas (like muscles), promoting oxygen unloading

Cooperative Binding of Haemoglobin

[oxyhaemoglobin]

Oxygen dissociation curves show the relationship between oxygen levels
(as partial pressure) and haemoglobin saturation

-   Because binding potential changes with each additional O₂ molecule,
    the saturation of haemoglobin is not linear

Adult Haemoglobin

-   The oxygen dissociation curve for adult haemoglobin is sigmoidal
    (i.e. S-shaped) due to cooperative binding
-   There is a low saturation of haemoglobin when oxygen levels are low
    (haemoglobin releases O₂ in hypoxic tissues)
-   There is a high saturation of haemoglobin when oxygen levels are
    high (haemoglobin binds O₂ in oxygen-rich tissues)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fetal hemoglobin is different from adultÂ hemoglobin allowing the
transfer of oxygen in the placenta onto the

Â  Â Â fetal hemoglobin

Â  Â Â 
Fetal Haemoglobin

-   The haemoglobin of the foetus has a slightly different molecular
    composition to adult haemoglobin
-   Consequently, it has a higher affinity for oxygen (dissociation
    curve is shifted to the left)
-   This is important as it means fetal haemoglobin will load oxygen
    when adult haemoglobin is unloading it (i.e. in the placenta)
-   Following birth, fetal haemoglobin is almost completely replaced by
    adult haemoglobin (~ 6 monthsÂ post-natally)
-   Fetal haemoglobin production can be pharmacologically induced in
    adults to treat diseases such as sickle cell anaemia

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of oxygen dissociation curves for haemoglobin and
myoglobin

Â  Â Â 
Myoglobin

-   Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding molecule that is found in skeletal
    muscle tissue
-   It is made of a single polypeptide with only one heme group and
    hence is not capable of cooperative binding
-   Consequently, the oxygen dissociation curve for myoglobin is not
    sigmoidal (it isÂ logarithmic)
-   Myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult haemoglobin
    and becomes saturated at lower oxygen levels
-   Myoglobin will hold onto its oxygen supply until levels in the
    muscles are very low (e.g. during intense physical activity)
-   The delayed release of oxygen helps to slow the onset of anaerobic
    respiration and lactic acid formation during exercise

â€¢ Â Consequences of high altitude for gas exchange

Â  Â Â 
Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by a single type of gas when it
is found within a mixture of gases

The partial pressure of a given gas will be determined by:

-   The concentration of the gas within the mixture (e.g. oxygen forms
    roughly 21% of the atmosphere)
-   The total pressure of the mixture (e.g. atmospheric pressure)

At high altitudes, air pressure is lower and hence there is a lower
partial pressure of oxygen (less O₂ because less air overall)

-   This makes it more difficult for haemoglobin to take up and
    transport oxygen (lower Hb % saturation)
-   Consequently, respiring tissue will receive less oxygen â€“ leading
    to symptoms such as fatigue, headaches and rapid pulse

Over time, the body may begin to acclimatise to the lower oxygen levels
at high altitudes:

-   Red blood cell production will increase in order to maximise oxygen
    uptake and transport
-   Red blood cells will have a higher haemoglobin count with a higher
    affinity for oxygen
-   Vital capacity will increase to improve rate of gas exchange
-   Muscles will produce more myoglobin and have increased
    vascularisation to improve overall oxygen supplyÂ 
-   Kidneys will begin to secrete alkaline urine (removal of excess
    bicarbonates improves buffering of blood pH)
-   People living permanently at high altitudes will have a greater lung
    surface area and larger chest sizes

Professional athletes will often incorporate high altitude training in
order to adopt these benefits prior to competition

-   Athletes may commonly either train at high altitudes (live low â€“
    train high) or recover at high altitudes (live high â€“ train low)

Phosphagen System

Phosphagens are energy storing compounds that are chiefly found in
muscle and nervous tissue in animals

-   They function as an immediate access reserve of high energy
    phosphates that can be used to make ATP
-   Phosphagens are found in tissues that experience rapidly changing
    energy needs (muscles and nerves)

A common phosphagen used by animals (including humans) is
phosphocreatine (or creatine phosphate â€“ CP)

-   At rest, ATP is hydrolysed to ADP and the phosphate is transferred
    to creatine to make phosphocreatine
    -   This occurs in the mitochondria, where ATP levels are high (thus
        driving the reaction)
-   During exercise, phosphocreatine is hydrolysed and the phosphate is
    released to make ATP from ADP
    -   This occurs in the muscles, where ADP levels will be high (thus
        driving the reaction)

Energy Systems

Phosphocreatine synthesises a pool of ATP more rapidly than cell
respiration, but reserves are quickly depleted

-   The phosphagen system will be used for the first 10 â€“ 12 seconds
    of intense exercise (e.g. a sprinter)

Anaerobic respiration provides a more sustained pool of ATP, but
produces lactic acid as a by-product

-   Anaerobic respiration (i.e. glycolysis) will be used for the first 1
    â€“ 2 minutes of exercise (e.g. 400 m swimmer)

Aerobic respiration requires a constant supply of oxygen, but can
produce a large yield of ATP

-   Aerobic respiration will be used for long-distance and less intense
    exercise activities (e.g. marathons)

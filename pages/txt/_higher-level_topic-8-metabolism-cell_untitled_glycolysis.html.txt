Understanding:

â€¢ Â In glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate in the cytoplasm

Â  Â Â 
The main organic compound used in cell respiration is carbohydrates
(glucose) â€“ although lipids and proteins can be used

-   Lipids are not preferentially used as they are harder to transport
    and digest (although will yield more energy per gram)
-   Proteins are not preferentially used as they release potentially
    toxic nitrogenous compounds when broken down

The first step in the controlled breakdown of carbohydrates is
glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol of the cell

-   In glycolysis, a hexose sugar (6C) is broken down into two molecules
    of pyruvate (3C)

The process of glycolysis involves many intermediate steps, but can be
summarised by four key events:

1. Â Phosphorylation

-   A hexose sugar (typically glucose) is phosphorylated by two
    molecules of ATP (to form a hexose bisphosphate)
-   This phosphorylation makes the molecule less stable and more
    reactive, and also prevents diffusion out of the cellÂ 

2. Â Lysis

-   The hexose biphosphate (6C sugar) is split into two triose
    phosphates (3C sugars)

3. Â Oxidation

-   Hydrogen atoms are removed from each of the 3C sugars (via
    oxidation) to reduce NAD⁺ to NADH (+ H⁺)
-   Two molecules of NADH are produced in total (one from each 3C sugar)

4. Â ATP formation

-   Some of the energy released from the sugar intermediates is used to
    directly synthesise ATP
-   This direct synthesis of ATP is called substrate level
    phosphorylation
-   In total, 4 molecules of ATP are generated during glycolysis by
    substrate level phosphorylation (2 ATP per 3C sugar)

At the end of glycolysis, the following reactions have occurred:

-   Glucose (6C) has been broken down into two molecules of pyruvate
    (3C)
-   Two hydrogen carriers have been reduced via oxidation (2Â Ã—Â NADH +
    H⁺)
-   A net total of two ATP molecules have been produced (4 molecules
    were generated, but 2 were used)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Glycolysis gives a small net gain of ATP without the use of oxygen

Â  Â Â 
Glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate (Ã— 2), with
a small net gain of ATP (two molecules)

-   Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol and does not require oxygen (it is
    an anaerobic process)

Depending on the availability of oxygen, the pyruvate may be subjected
to one of two alternative processes:

-   Aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen and results in
    the further production of ATP (~ 34 molecules)
-   Anaerobic respiration (fermentation) occurs in the absence of oxygen
    and no further ATP is produced

Aerobic Respiration

-   If oxygen is present, the pyruvate is transported to the
    mitochondria for further breakdown (complete oxidation)
-   This further oxidation generates large numbers of reduced hydrogen
    carriers (NADH + H⁺ and FADH₂)
-   In the presence of oxygen, the reduced hydrogen carriers can release
    their stored energy to synthesise more ATP
-   Aerobic respiration involves three additional processes â€“ the link
    reaction, krebs cycle and the electron transport chain

Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation)

-   If oxygen is not present, pyruvate is not broken down further and no
    more ATP is produced (incomplete oxidation)
-   The pyruvate remains in the cytosol and is converted into lactic
    acid (animals) or ethanol and CO₂ (plants and yeast)
-   This conversion is reversible and is necessary to ensure that
    glycolysis can continue to produce small quantities of ATP
    -   Glycolysis involves oxidation reactions that cause hydrogen
        carriers (NAD⁺) to be reduced (becomes NADH + H⁺)
    -   Typically, the reduced hydrogen carriers are oxidised via
        aerobic respiration to restore available stocks of NAD⁺
    -   In the absence of oxygen, glycolysis will quickly deplete
        available stocks of NAD⁺, preventing further glycolysis
    -   Fermentation of pyruvate involves a reduction reaction that
        oxidises NADH (releasing NAD⁺Â to restore available stocks)
    -   Hence, anaerobic respiration allows small amounts of ATP to be
        produced (via glycolysis) in the absence of oxygen

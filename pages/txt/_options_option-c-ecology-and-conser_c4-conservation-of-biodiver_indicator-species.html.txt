Understanding:

â€¢ Â An indicator species is an organism used to assess a specific
environmental condition

Â  Â Â 
Indicators species are sensitive to specific environmental conditions
and consequently have a limited range of tolerance

-   Their population growth or reduction indicates changes in the
    environment, making them a useful means of monitoring change

Indicator species may be sensitive to a number of different
environmental conditions:

-   Lichen, along with mosses, are susceptible to air-borne pollutants
    dissolved in water (e.g. sulfur dioxide)
-   Tubifex worms are sensitive toÂ concentrations of heavy metals
-   Mayfly larva and certain aquatic invertebrates are sensitive to
    dissolved oxygen levels in water

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Relative numbers of an indicator species can be used to calculate
the value of a biotic index

Â  Â Â 
Biotic indices compare the relative frequency of indicator species and
provide an overall assessment of environmental health

-   Calculating a biotic index involves multiplying the population size
    of each indicator species by its pollution tolerance rating

[biotic index]

The following conclusions can be drawn from a biotic index:

-   A high biotic index indicates the presence of many
    pollution-sensitive organisms, denoting an unpolluted environment
-   A low biotic index indicates a polluted environment, due to a
    relative abundance of pollution-tolerant organisms
-   A change in the biotic index over time marks a change in the
    environmental conditions within a given ecosystem

Pollution Tolerance and Environmental Pollution Levels

Practice Question

[question]
Calculate the biotic index to compare levels of pollution at two
locations along a stream
Site 1: 8 stonefly nymph, 1 freshwater shrimp and 1 tubifex worm was
collected.
Site 2: 4 stonefly nymph, 10 freshwater shrimp and 6 tubifex worms were
collected.

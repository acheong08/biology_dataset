Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mutagens, oncogenes and metastasis are involved in the development
of primary and secondary tumoursÂ 

Â  Â Â 
Tumours are abnormal cell growths resulting from uncontrolled cell
division and can occur in any tissue or organ

-   Diseases caused by the growth of tumours are collectively known as
    cancers

Mutagens

A mutagen is an agent that changes the genetic material of an organism
(either acts on the DNA or the replicative machinery)

Mutagens may be physical, chemical or biological in origin:

-   Physical â€“ Sources of radiation including X-rays
    (ionising),Â ultraviolet (UV) light and radioactive decay
-   Chemical â€“ DNA interacting substances including reactive oxygen
    species (ROS) and metals (e.g. arsenic)
-   Biological â€“ Viruses, certain bacteria and mobile genetic elements
    (transposons)

Mutagens that lead to the formation of cancer are further classified as
carcinogens

Oncogenes

An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer

Most cancers are caused by mutations to two basic classes of genes
â€“Â proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes

-   Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that stimulate the cell cycle and
    promote cell growth and proliferation
-   Tumour suppressor genes code for proteins that repress cell cycle
    progression and promote apoptosis

When aÂ proto-oncogene is mutated or subjected to increased expression
it becomes a cancer-causing oncogene

Tumour suppressor genes are sometimes referred to as anti-oncogenes, as
their normal function prevents cancer

Metastasis

Tumour cells may either remain in their original location (benign) or
spread and invade neighbouring tissue (malignant)

Metastasis is the spread of cancer from one location (primary tumour) to
another, forming a secondary tumour

Secondary tumours are made up of the same type of cell as the primary
tumour â€“ this affects the type of treatment required

-   E.g. If breast cancer spread to the liver, the patient has secondary
    breast cancer of the liver (treat with breast cancer drugs)

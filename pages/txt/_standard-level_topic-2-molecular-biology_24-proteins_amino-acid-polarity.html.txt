Amino Acid Polarity

Amino acids may be either polar or non-polar depending on the
composition of their side chain

-   Polar amino acids have hydrophilic R groups, while non-polar amino
    acids have hydrophobic R groups

The localisation of polar and non-polar amino acids will be determined
by the type of protein and its function:
Water soluble proteins:

-   Non-polar amino acids tend to be found in the centre of the molecule
    (stabilise the structure)
-   Polar amino acids tend to be located on the protein surface (capable
    of interacting with water molecules)

Membrane-bound proteins:

-   Non-polar amino acids tend to be located on the regions of the
    surface in contact with the membrane
-   Polar amino acids will generally line interior pores (to create
    hydrophilic channels)

Enzymes:

-   The active site specifically depends on the location and
    distribution of polar and non-polar amino acids as hydrophobic and
    hydrophilic interactions can play a role in substrate binding to the
    active site

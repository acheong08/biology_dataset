Types of Signalling

Cells communicate via various types of signalling by which chemicals
travel to target sites in order to elicit a response

-   Different types of cell signalling include autocrine, paracrine and
    endocrine signalling

Autocrine

-   Autocrine signalling occurs when the chemicals released by a cell
    stimulate the cell itself (i.e.Â â€˜selfâ€™ signalling)
-   An example is the proliferation of T lymphocytes following cytokine
    release from an activated T lymphocyte

Paracrine

-   Paracrine signalling occurs when the chemicals released by a cell
    stimulate a neighbouring cell
-   An example is the stimulation of post-synaptic neurons by
    neurotransmitters released from a pre-synapticÂ neuron

Endocrine

-   Endocrine signalling occurs when a chemical released by a cell
    travels in the bloodstream to activate distant cells
-   An example is the release of hormones from endocrine glands to
    activate distant target tissue

Types of Secretion

Hormones are released indiscriminately into the bloodstream and only
activate cells and tissues with specific receptors

-   While hormonal responses are slower than nervous responses, the
    duration of effect can be longer
-   Hormones work at low concentrations, but sustained release is viable
    if hormones are stored within the secretory cells

Hormonal secretion can either be constitutive or regulated according to
need:

-   In constitutive secretion, hormones are released as they are
    produced (vesicles fuse directly with the cell membrane)
-   In regulated secretion, hormones are stored in vesicles and only
    released following an external signal

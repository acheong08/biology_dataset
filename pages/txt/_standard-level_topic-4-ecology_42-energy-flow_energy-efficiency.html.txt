Understanding:

â€¢ Â Energy losses between trophic levels restrict the length of food
chains and the biomass of higher trophic levels

Â  Â Â 
When energy transformations take place in living organisms the process
is never 100% efficient

-   Most of the energy is lost to the organism â€“ either used in
    respiration, released as heat, excreted in faeces or unconsumed
-   Typically energy transformations are ~10% efficient, with about 90%
    of available energy lost between trophic levels
-   The amount of energy transferred depends on how efficiently
    organisms can capture and use energy (usually between 5 â€“ 20%)

As energy is lost between trophic levels, higher trophic levels store
less energy as carbon compounds and so have less biomass

-   Biomass is the total mass of a group of organisms â€“ consisting of
    the carbon compounds contained in the cells and tissues
-   Because carbon compounds store energy, scientists can measure the
    amount of energy added to organisms as biomass
-   Biomass diminishes along food chains with the loss of carbon
    dioxide, water and waste products (e.g. urea) to the environmentÂ 

Because energy and biomass is lost between each level of a food chain,
the number of potential trophic levels are limited

-   Higher trophic levels receive less energy / biomass from feeding and
    so need to eat larger quantities to obtain sufficient amounts
-   Because higher trophic levels need to eat more, they expend more
    energy (and biomass) hunting for food
-   If the energy required to hunt food exceeds the energy available
    from the food eaten, the trophic level becomes unviable

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Metabolism is the web of all the enzyme-catalysed reactions in a
cell or organism

Â  Â Â 
Metabolism describes the totality of chemical processes that occur
within a living organism in order to maintain life

-   It is the web of all enzyme-catalysed reactions that occur within a
    cell or organism

Metabolic reactions serve two key functions:Â 

-   They provide a source of energy for cellular processes (growth,
    reproduction, etc.)Â 
-   They enable the synthesis and assimilation of new materials for use
    within the cell

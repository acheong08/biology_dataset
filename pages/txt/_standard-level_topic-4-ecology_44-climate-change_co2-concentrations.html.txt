Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recent increases in atmospheric CO₂ are largely due to increases
in the combustion of fossilised organic matter

Â  Â Â 
While greenhouse gases occur naturally, man is increasing greenhouse gas
emission via a number of activities, including:

-   Deforestation â€“ the removal of trees means that less carbon
    dioxide is removed from the atmosphere via photosynthesis
-   Increased farming / agriculture â€“ this involves land clearing for
    cattle grazing, also ruminant cattle produce methaneÂ 

The greenhouse gas that is increasing most rapidly in the atmosphere is
carbon dioxide and the main cause is combustion

-   When fossil fuels (e.g. coal, oil, gas) are combusted to release
    energy, carbon dioxide gas is released as a by-product
-   The increased reliance on fossil fuels following the industrial
    revolution has resulted in ~38% increase in CO₂ levels
-   There are now efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by
    exploiting alternative energy sources (e.g. solar power)

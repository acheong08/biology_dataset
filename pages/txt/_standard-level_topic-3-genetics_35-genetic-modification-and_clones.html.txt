Understanding:

â€¢ Â Clones are groups of genetically identical organisms, derived from
a single original parent cell

Â  Â Â 
Clones are groups of genetically identical organisms or a group of cells
derived from a single original parent cell

-   Organisms that reproduce asexually will produce genetically
    identical clones
-   Additionally, mechanisms exist whereby sexually reproducing
    organisms can produce clones (e.g. identical twins)

Cloning multicellular organisms requires the production of stem cells
(differentiated cells cannot form other cell types)

-   Stem cells can be artificially generated from adult tissue using a
    process called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)

Application:

â€¢ Â Production of cloned embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear
transfer

Â  Â Â 
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a method by which cloned embryos can be
produced using differentiated adult cells

-   Somatic cells are removed from the adult donor and cultured (these
    cells are diploid and contain the entire genome)
-   An unfertilised egg is removed from a female adult and its haploid
    nucleus is removed to produce an enucleated egg cell
-   The enucleated egg cell is fused with the nucleus from the adult
    donor to make a diploid egg cell (with the donorâ€™s DNA)
-   An electric current is then delivered to stimulate the egg to divide
    and develop into an embryo
-   The embryo is then implanted into the uterus of a surrogate and will
    develop into a genetic clone of the adult donorÂ

Centimorgan

A centimorgan is a unit of measure used to approximate the distance
between genes

-   Thomas Morgan demonstrated that genes that were further apart on a
    chromosome were more likely to recombine
-   This is because there are more potential sites for crossing over to
    occur between distant genes

One centimorgan (or genetic map unit / m. u.) is the equivalent to a
recombination frequency of 1%

-   A centimorgan is not a true measure of distance and will differ in
    equivalence between species
-   In humans, 1 cM corresponds to approximately 1 million bp on average

While centimorgans may still be used to quantitate recombination
frequencies, they are no longer used to measure distance

-   Genome mapping has allowed scientists to determine specific
    distances between genes inÂ kilo bases (kb)

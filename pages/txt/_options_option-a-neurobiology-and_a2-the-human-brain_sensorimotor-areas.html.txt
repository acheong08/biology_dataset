Sensorimotor Areas

Tactile perception (touch) and gross physical movements are coordinated
by the sensorimotor areas of the brain

-   The primary motor cortex is located in theÂ precentral gyrus
    (frontal lobe) and handles motor signals
-   The somatosensory cortex is located in theÂ postcentral gyrus
    (parietal lobe) and handles tactile sensory signals

These two regions each form a cortical homunculus â€“ a neurological map
of the anatomical divisions of the body

-   Parts of this representation of the human body are
    disproportionately large as these regions are highly innervated
-   The hands, tongue and lips are very large as these appendages
    require more nervous control (e.g. for speech)
-   Areas with less innervation (e.g. torso) have less of the cortex
    dedicated to their functioning and appear small

â€¢ Â Blood sharing in vampire bats as an example of the development of
altruistic behaviour by natural selection

Â  Â Â 
Altruism is behaviour which benefits another individual at the cost of
the performer

-   Ostensibly, it is in opposition to natural selection as it reduces
    the potential for the altruistic individual passing on their genes
-   However, it improves the chances of the other individual passing on
    genes into the same gene pool (i.e. inclusive fitness)

If the individuals are closely related, altruistic genes will persist in
the gene pool and be naturally selected

-   Enhancing the reproductive success of relatives who share common
    genes is called kin selection
-   Organisms that live in social clusters will also promote the
    conservation of altruistic genes viaÂ reciprocal altruism

The occurrence of altruistic behaviours will be determined by three
factors (known as Hamiltonâ€™s rule: rB > C)

-   The cost to the performer (C) should be small, while the benefit to
    a receiver (B) and degree of relatedness (r) should be large

Blood Sharing Among Vampire Bats

Vampire bats commonly regurgitate blood to share with unlucky roost
mates who were unable to gain independentÂ sustenance

-   Vampire bats cannot survive multiple successive days without food,
    however food can often be difficult to find
-   The small cost of sharing blood (lost time until starvation) is less
    than the benefit received (time gained)
-   Hence sharing blood improves the fitness of the entire brood (via
    reciprocal altruism), increasing the occurrence of altruism

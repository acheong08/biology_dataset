â€¢ Â Testing for association between two species using the chi-squared
test with data obtained by quadrat sampling

Â  Â Â 
The presence of two species within a given environment will be dependent
upon potential interactions between them
If two species are typically found within the same habitat, they show a
positive association

-   Species that show a positive association include those that exhibit
    predator-prey or symbiotic relationships

If two species tend not to occur within the same habitat, they show a
negative association

-   Species will typically show a negative association if there is
    competition for the same resources
    -   One species may utilise the resources more efficiently,
        precluding survival of the other species (competitive exclusion)
    -   Both species may alter their use of the environment to avoid
        direct competition (resource partitioning)

If two species do not interact, there will be no association between
them and their distribution will be independent of one another

Quadrat Sampling

The presence of two species within a given environment can be determined
using quadrat sampling

-   A quadrat is a rectangular frame of known dimensions that can be
    used to establish population densities
    -   Quadrats are placed inside a defined area in either a random
        arrangement or according to a design (e.g. belted transect)
    -   The number of individuals of a given species is either counted
        or estimated via percentage coverage
    -   The sampling process is repeated many times in order to gain a
        representative data set

Quadrat sampling is not an effective method for counting motile
organisms â€“ it is used for counting plants and sessile animals

-   In eachÂ quadrat, the presence or absence of each species is
    identified
-   This allows for the number of quadrats where both species were
    present to be compared against the total number ofÂ quadrats

Chi-Squared Tests

A chi-squared test can be applied to data generated fromÂ quadrat
sampling to determine if there is a statistically significant
association between the distribution of two species

A chi-squared test can be completed by following five simple steps:

-   Identify hypotheses (null versus alternative)
-   Construct a table of frequencies (observed versus expected)
-   Apply the chi-squared formula
-   Determine the degree of freedom (df)
-   Identify the p value (should be <0.05)

â€¢ Â Recognising and interpreting statistical significance

Â  Â Â 
Example of Chi-Squared Test Application

The presence or absence of two species of scallop was recorded in fifty
quadrats (1m²) on a rocky sea shoreÂ 

The following distribution pattern was observed:

-   6Â quadrats = both species Â ; Â 15 quadrats = king scallop only Â ;
    Â 20 quadrats = queen scallop only Â ; Â 9Â quadrats = neither
    speciesÂ 

[chi1]

Step 1:Â Â Identify hypotheses

A chi-squared test seeks to distinguish between two distinct
possibilities and hence requires two contrasting hypotheses:

-   Null hypothesis (H₀):Â There isÂ noÂ significant difference between
    the distribution of two species (i.e. distribution is random)
-   Alternative hypothesis (H₁):Â ThereÂ isÂ a significant difference
    between the distribution of species (i.e. species are associated)

Step 2:Â Â Construct a table of frequencies

A table must be constructed that identifies expected distribution
frequencies for each species (for comparison against observed)

Expected frequencies are calculated according to the following
formula:Â 

-   Expected frequency = (Row totalÂ Ã— Column total)Â Ã· Grand total

[chi2]

Step 3:Â Â Apply the chi-squared formula

The formula used to calculate a statistical value for the chi-squared
test is as follows:

[]

Where: Â âˆ‘Â = Sum Â ; Â O = Observed frequency Â ; Â E = Expected
frequency
These calculations can be broken down for each part of the distribution
pattern to make the final summation easier

[chi3]

Based on these results the statistical value calculated by the
chi-squared test is as follows:

-   ð??Œ²Â  = Â (2.20 + 2.38 + 1.59 + 1.73) Â = Â 7.90

Step 4:Â Â Determine the degree of freedom (df)

In order to determine if the chi-squared value is statistically
significant a degree of freedom must first be identified

-   The degree of freedom is a mathematical restriction that designates
    what range of values fall within each significance levelÂ 

The degree of freedom is calculated from the table of frequencies
according to the following formula:

df = (m â€“ 1) (n â€“ 1)Â 

Where: Â mÂ = number of rows Â ; Â nÂ = number of columns

-   When the distribution patterns for two species are being compared,
    the degree of freedom should always be 1

Step 5:Â Â Identify the p value

The final step is to apply the value generated to a chi-squared
distribution table to determine if results are statistically significant

-   A value is considered significant if there is less than a 5%
    probability (p < 0.05) the results are attributable to chance

[chi4]

When df = 1, a value of greater than 3.841 is required for results to be
considered statistically significant (p < 0.05)

-   A value of 7.90 lies above a p value of 0.01, meaning there is less
    than a 1% probability results are caused by chance
-   Hence, the difference between observed and expected frequencies
    areÂ statistically significant

As the results are statistically significant, the null hypothesis is
rejected and the alternate hypothesis accepted:

-   Alternate hypothesis (H₁):Â There isÂ a significant difference
    between observed and expected frequencies
-   Because the two species do not tend to be present in the same area,
    we can infer there is a negative association between them

Practice Question

[question] Two species of fir tree are found along the coast of Southern
California.
These two tree species are the Grand Fir (Abies grandis) and the Noble
Fir (Abies procera).
Their distribution patterns were establsihed via 150 quadrat samples,
yielding the following results:
25 = both present ; 30 = Noble Fir only ; 45 = Grand Fir only ; 50
neither present
Activity: Use the chi-squared test to determine if these two plant
species show association.

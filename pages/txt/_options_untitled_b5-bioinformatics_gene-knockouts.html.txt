Application:

â€¢ Â Use of knockout technology in mice to determine gene function

Â  Â Â 
A gene knockout is a genetic technique whereby a specific gene is
rendered inoperative within an organism

-   Using the Cre-LoxP system, this gene knockout can be targeted to
    specific tissues within the organism (conditional knockout)

The Cre-LoxP system uses the enzyme Cre recombinase to remove genetic
sequences located between two Lox sites

-   Using recombinant DNA technology, LoxP sequences are inserted on
    either side of a gene of interest in a test animal
-   The Cre gene is inserted next to aÂ tissue-specificÂ promoter in
    another test animal
-   When the two animals are bred, the resulting offspring will possess
    LoxP sequences and a tissue-specific Cre recombinase
-   The Cre recombinase will remove the gene located between the Lox
    sites to create a conditional knockout for further study

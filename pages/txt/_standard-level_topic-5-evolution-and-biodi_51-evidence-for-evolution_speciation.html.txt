Understanding:

â€¢ Â Continuous variation across a geographical range of related
populations matches the concept of gradual divergence

Â  Â Â 
Within a population of any given species there will be genetic variation
(i.e. variation which is inheritable)

-   Typically this variation will be continuous and follow a normal
    distribution curve as the rate of change is gradual and cumulative

If two populations of a species become geographically separated then
they will likely experience different ecological conditions

-   Over time, the two populations will adapt to the different
    environmental conditions and gradually diverge from one another

The degree of divergence will depend on the extent of geographical
separation and the amount of time since separationÂ occurred

-   Populations located in close proximity that separated recently will
    show less variation (less divergence)
-   Distant populations that separated a longer period of time ago will
    show more variation (more divergence)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Populations of a species can gradually diverge into separate
species via evolution

Â  Â Â 
The degree of divergence between geographically separated
populationsÂ will gradually increaseÂ the longer they are separated

-   As the genetic divergence between the related populations increase,
    their geneticÂ compatibility consequently decreases
-   Eventually, the two populations will diverge to an extent where they
    can no longer interbreed if returned to a shared environment

When two populations can no longer interbreed and produce fertile,
viable offspring they are considered to be separate species

-   The evolutionary process by which two related populations diverge
    intoÂ separate species is called speciation

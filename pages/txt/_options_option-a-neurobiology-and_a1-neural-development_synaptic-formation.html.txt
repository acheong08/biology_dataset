Understanding:

â€¢ Â A developing neuron forms multiple synapses

Â  Â Â 
A synapse is a junction at which a neuron transmits a signal to another
cell (relay neuron or effector)

-   Most synapses transmit chemical signals, although electrical
    synapses also exist

A developing neuron will form multiple synapses, creating a vast array
of permutable communication pathways

-   Within the CNS, a neuron may form a synapse with another axon,
    dendrite or cell body (soma)
-   Within the PNS, a neuron may form a synapse with a muscle fibre
    (neuromuscular) or gland (neuroglandular)
-   SomeÂ neurons may form a synapse with capillaries and secrete
    chemicals directly into the bloodstream (neurosecretory)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synapses that are not used do not persist

â€¢ Â Neural pruning involves the loss of unusedÂ neurons

Â  Â Â 
During embryonic and early post-natal development, neurons will form
multiple synapses to maximise available connections

-   As an organism matures, some synapses are used more frequently and
    these connections are consequently strengthened
-   Other synapses are not used as often and these connections are
    weakened and do not persist
-   This strengthening and weakening of certain neural pathways is
    central to the concept of how organisms learn

Neural pruning involves the loss of unused neurons (by removing excess
axons and eliminating their synaptic connections)

-   Infant and adult brains typically have the same total number of
    neurons (roughly 100 billion neurons in total)
-   However infant brains form vastly more synaptic connections
    (approximately twice the number found in adult brains)

The purpose of neural pruning seems to be to reinforce complex wiring
patterns associated with learned behaviour

-   Pruning is influenced by environmental factors and is mediated by
    the release of chemical signals from glial cells

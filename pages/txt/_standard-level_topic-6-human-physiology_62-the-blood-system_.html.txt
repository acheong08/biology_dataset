6.2 Â The Blood System

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The blood system continuously transports substances
to cells andÂ simultaneously collects waste products

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Arteries convey blood at high pressure from the ventricles to the
    tissues of the body
-   Arteries have muscle cells and elastic fibres in their walls
-   The muscle and elastic fibres assist in maintaining blood pressure
    between pump cycles
-   Blood flows through tissues in capillaries
-   Capillaries have permeable walls that allow exchange of material
    between cells in the tissue and the blood in the capillary
-   Veins collect blood at low pressure from the tissues of the body and
    return it to the atria of the heart
-   Valves in veins and the heart ensure circulation of blood by
    preventingÂ backflow
-   There is a separate circulation for the lungs
-   The heart beat is initiated by a group of specialised muscle cells
    in the right atrium called the sinoatrial node
-   The sinoatrial node acts as a pacemaker
-   The sinoatrial node sends out an electrical signal that stimulates
    contraction as it is propagated through the walls of the atria and
    then the walls of the ventricles
-   The heart rate can be increased or decreased by impulses brought to
    the heart through two nerves from the medulla of the brain
-   Epinephrine increases the heart rate to prepare for vigorous
    physical activity

Applications:

-   William Harveyâ€™s discovery of the circulation of blood with the
    heart acting as a pump
-   Pressure changes in the left atrium, left ventricle and aorta during
    the cardiac cycle
-   Causes and consequences of occlusion of the coronary arteries

Skills:

-   Identification of blood vessels as arteries, capillaries or veins
    from the structure of their walls
-   Recognition of the chambers and valves of the heart and the blood
    vessels connected to it in dissected hearts or in diagrams of heart
    structure

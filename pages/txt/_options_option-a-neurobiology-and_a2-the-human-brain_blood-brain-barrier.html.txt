Blood-Brain Barrier

The blood-brain barrier is a selective barrier that separates
circulating blood from cerebrospinal fluid of the brain

-   It is formed by brain endothelial cells which are connected by tight
    junctions
-   It functions to prevent the movement of large molecules (e.g.
    bacteria) from the blood into the brain
-   Smaller molecules (such as O₂, CO₂ and hormones) can still freely
    cross the blood-brain barrier

The purpose of the blood-brain barrier is to protect the brain from most
pathogenic infections

-   As a result, brain diseases are rare but are also difficult to treat
    (antibodies cannot cross the blood-brain barrier)
-   Diseases that may be associated with the deterioration of the
    blood-brain barrier include meningitis and MS

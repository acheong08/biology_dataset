Application:

â€¢ Â Urea as an example of a compound that is produced by living
organisms but can also beÂ artificiallyÂ synthesised

Â  Â Â 
Vitalism was a doctrine that dictated that organic molecules could only
be synthesised by living systems

-   It was believed that living things possessed a certainÂ â€œvital
    forceâ€?Â needed to make organic molecules
-   Hence organic compounds were thought to possess a non-physical
    element lacking from inorganic molecules

Vitalism as a theory has since been disproven with the discovery that
organic molecules can be artificially synthesised

-   In 1828, Frederick Woehler heated an inorganic salt (ammonium
    cyanate) and produced urea
-   Urea is a waste product of nitrogen metabolism and is eliminated by
    the kidneys in mammals
-   The artificial synthesis of urea demonstrates that organic molecules
    are not fundamentally different to inorganic molecules

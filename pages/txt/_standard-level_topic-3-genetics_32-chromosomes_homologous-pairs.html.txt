Understanding:

â€¢ Â Homologous chromosomes carry the same sequence of genes but not
necessarilyÂ theÂ 

Â  Â same alleles of those genes

Â  Â Â 
Sexually reproducing organisms inherit their genetic sequences from both
parentsÂ 

-   This means that these organisms will possess two copies of each
    chromosome (one of maternal origin ; one of paternal origin)
-   These maternal and paternal chromosome pairs are called homologous
    chromosomes

Homologous chromosomes are chromosomes that share:

-   The same structural features (e.g. same size, same banding patterns,
    same centromere positions)
-   The same genes at the same loci positions (while the genes are the
    same, alleles may be different)

Homologous chromosomes must be separated in gametes (via meiosis) prior
to reproduction, in order to prevent chromosome numbers continually
doubling with each generation

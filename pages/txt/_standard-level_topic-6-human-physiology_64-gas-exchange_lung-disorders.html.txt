Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of lung cancer

Â  Â Â 
Lung cancer describes the uncontrolled proliferation of lung cells,
leading to the abnormal growth of lung tissue (tumour)

-   The abnormal growth can impact on normal tissue function, leading to
    a variety of symptoms according to size and location
-   The tumours can remain in place (benign) or spread to other regions
    of the body (malignant)

Lung cancers are the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide
for two main reasons:

-   The lungs are vital to normal body function and thus the abrogation
    of their normal function is particularly detrimental to health
-   The lungs possess a very rich blood supply, increasing the
    likelihood of the cancer spreading (metastasis) to other body
    regions

The common symptoms of lung cancers include coughing up blood, wheezing,
respiratory distress and weight loss

-   If the cancer mass compresses adjacent organs it can cause chest
    pain, difficulty swallowing and heart complications

There are many causes for lung cancer, including smoking, asbestos, air
pollution, certain infections and genetic predispositions

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of emphysema

Â  Â Â 
Emphysema is a lung condition whereby the walls of the alveoli lose
their elasticity due to damage to the alveolar walls

-   The loss of elasticity results in the abnormal enlargement of the
    alveoli, leading to a lower total surface area for gas exchange
-   The degradation of the alveolar walls can cause holes to develop and
    alveoli to merge into huge air spaces (pulmonaryÂ bullae)

The major cause of emphysema is smoking, as the chemical irritants in
cigarette smoke damage the alveolar walls

-   The damage to lung tissue leads to the recruitment of phagocytes to
    the region, which produce an enzyme called elastase
-   This elastase, released as part of an inflammatory response, breaks
    down the elastic fibres in the alveolar wall
-   Elastase activity can be blocked by an enzyme inhibitor
    (Î±-1-antitrypsin), but not when elastase concentrations are
    increasedÂ 
-   A small proportion of emphysema cases are due to a hereditary
    deficiency in this enzyme inhibitor due to a gene mutation

Common symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath, phlegm
production, expansion of the ribcage, cyanosis and an increased
susceptibility to chest infections

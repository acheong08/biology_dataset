Understanding:

â€¢ Â The early stages of meiosis involve pairing of homologous
chromosomes and crossing overÂ 

Â  Â  followed byÂ condensation

Â  Â Â 
In prophase I, homologous chromosomes undergo a process called synapsis,
whereby they pair up to form a bivalent (or tetrad)

-   The homologous chromosomes are held together at points called
    chiasmata (singular: chiasma)

Crossing over of genetic material between non-sister chromatids can
occur at these chiasmata

-   As a result of this exchange of genetic material, new gene
    combinations are formed on chromatids (recombination)

Once chiasmata are formed, the homologous chromosomes condense as
bivalents and then are separated in meiosis

-   If crossing over occurs then all four haploid daughter cells will be
    geneticallyÂ distinct (sister chromatids are no longer identical)

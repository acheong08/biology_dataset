Sickle Cell versus Malaria

Sickle cell anaemia is controlled by a single gene mutation (via a base
substitution to the haemoglobin beta chain gene)

-   The sixth codon is mutated (GAGÂ â†’Â GUG) which changes the amino
    acid sequence (GluÂ â†’Â Val)

Individuals who only possess the sickle cell allele will have abnormally
shaped red blood cells that are destroyed by the spleen

-   This leads to a reduction in red blood cells and a variety of health
    complications associated with reduced blood cell circulation

Those who only possess the normal blood cell allele do not suffer from
sickle cell anaemia but are more susceptible to malaria

-   Malaria is caused by an endoparasite (Plasmodium falciparum) which
    reproduces inside red blood cells (but not sickle cells)

Incidence of Malaria

In areas where malaria is common, there is a higher incidence of people
who carry both alleles (i.e. are heterozygous)
These individuals produce enough normal blood cells to avoid the more
severe effects associated with sickle cell anaemia, but also produce
enough sickle cells to confer an increased resistance to the malarial
parasite

-   This condition whereby the presence of both alleles is beneficial is
    known as heterozygous advantage

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Innate behaviour is inherited from parents and so develops
independently of the environment

Â  Â Â 
A behaviour is typically defined as any observable action by a living
organisms

-   Behaviours can be categorised as either innate or learned

An innate behaviour is an instinctive response that is developmentally
fixed â€“ it is independent of environmental context

-   Innate behaviours have a genetic basis and are hence inherited from
    parents

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data from invertebrate behaviour experiments in terms
of the effect on chances of survival andÂ 

Â  Â Â reproduction

Â  Â Â 
Any instinctive response that improves survival and reproductive
prospects will become more common by natural selection

-   Examples of innate behavioural responses seen in invertebrates
    include taxis and kinesis

Taxis

Taxis is a change in movement in response to an environmental stimulus
â€“ either towards (positive) or away (negative)

Euglena is a photosynthetic microorganism that requires light as an
energy source and hence displays positive phototaxis

-   Step 1: Â Place Euglena in a petri dish with appropriate
    environmental conditions for survival
-   Step 2: Â Cover the dish with aluminium foil, excluding a few small
    exposed sections
-   Observation: Â With a light source placed above the dish, the
    Euglena should migrate towards the exposed sections

Kinesis

Kinesis is a change in the rate of activity in response to an
environmental stimulus

Woodlice have gills for respiration and tend to prefer moist conditions
(their gills may dry out in dry conditions)

-   Step 1: Â Place a woodlouse in a dry petri dish and mark its
    movements every 30 seconds
-   Step 2: Â Repeat this process for a second woodlouse placed in moist
    conditions (i.e. petri dish lined with wet paper towel)
-   Observation: Â The woodlouse in dry conditions should have a higher
    rate of movement (improve chances of finding moisture)

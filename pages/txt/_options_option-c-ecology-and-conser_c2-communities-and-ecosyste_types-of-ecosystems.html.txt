Understanding:

â€¢ Â In closed ecosystems energy but not matter is exchanged with the
surroundings

Â  Â Â 
Ecosystems can be described as closed or open according to whether
matter moves into and out of the system

-   A closed ecosystem exchanges energy but not matter with its
    surroundings â€“ it is self-contained (e.g. mesocosm)
-   An open ecosystem exchanges both energy and matter with surrounding
    environments (e.g. a natural ecosystem)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The type of stable ecosystem that will emerge in an area is
predictable based on climate

Â  Â Â 
An ecosystem is the interaction of living and non-living things within
an area (i.e. a community and its abiotic environment)

-   Particular types of stable ecosystems will emerge in a given
    geographical area according to climate conditions

A biome is a geographical area that has a particular climate and
sustains a specific community of plants and animals

-   The main factors affecting the distribution of biomes is temperature
    and rainfall
-   These factors will vary according to lattitude and longitude, as
    well as altitude and proximity to the ocean

There are a number of different biomes found across the continents,
including:

-   Tropical rainforests â€“ hot and humid environments near the equator
    with dense vegetation and high biodiversity
-   Taiga â€“ coniferous forests near the poles that have cold
    temperatures and little precipitation (moisture trapped as snow /
    ice)
-   Deserts â€“ dry and arid environments that display extreme
    temperature conditions (hot and cold)

Endangered Species

An endangered species is one that has been categorised by the IUCN as
likely to become extinct

-   The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) currently
    lists over 3,000 species as endangered

The determination of a species conservation status (likelihood of
becoming extinct) is based on numerous factors:

-   These include the rate of decline, population size, area of
    geographic distribution and degree of population fragmentation

The IUCN has produced a red list, which classifies species into nine
groups:

-   Extinct (EX) â€“ no surviving individuals (e.g. tasmanian tiger)
-   Extinct in Wild (EW) â€“ captive individuals survive, but there is
    no wild population (e.g. Barbary lion)
-   Critically Endangered (CR) â€“ faces an extremely high risk of
    extinction in the near future (e.g. red wolf)
-   Endangered (EN) â€“ faces a high risk of extinction in the near
    future (e.g. snow leopard)
-   Vulnerable (VU) â€“ faces a high risk of endangerment in the medium
    term (e.g. Indian rhinoceros)
-   Near Threatened (NT) â€“ may be considered threatened in the near
    future (e.g. tiger shark)
-   Least Concern (LC) â€“ no immediate threat to species survival (e.g.
    giraffe)
-   All other organisms may be listed as Data Deficient (DD) or Not
    Evaluated (NE)

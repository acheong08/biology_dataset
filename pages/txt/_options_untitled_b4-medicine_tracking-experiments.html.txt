Understanding:

â€¢ Â Tracking experiments are used to gain information about the
localization and interaction of a desired protein

Â  Â  Â Â 
If a protein is labelled to enable detection, its subsequent movements
can be tracked to gain information about its function

-   Tracking protein locations can provide information about cellular
    and subcellular targets for protein activity
-   Tracking protein interactions can provide information about reaction
    pathways with which the protein is involved

Proteins can be tracked by tagging with a fluorescent molecule to enable
detection with appropriate imaging devices

-   Consideration must be given as to whether forming a fluorescent
    complex will impair its ability to interact with targets

Alternatively, proteins can be tracked by incorporating radioactively
labelled amino acids into its structure

-   This is called a pulse-chase experiment, as the protein is
    radiolabelled (â€˜pulseâ€™) to enable its temporary detection
    (â€˜chaseâ€™)

Application:

â€¢ Â Tracking tumour cells using transferrin linked to luminescent
probes

Â  Â  Â Â 
Transferrins are protein molecules that transport iron within the blood
plasma

-   Transferrin facilitates iron uptake into target cells by binding to
    specific transferrin receptors, which mediate endocytosis

The expression of transferrin receptors is significantly upregulated in
tumour cells (i.e. they have a lot more of them)

-   This means that transferrins will bind more frequently to tumour
    cells as they have more transferrin receptors
-   If transferrin is linked to a luminescent probe, tumour cells will
    therefore show greater luminescence

Tumour Tracking

Because tumour cells will luminesce more brightly, transferrin-linked
luminescent probes can be used to locate tumours

-   This can be useful in determining the rates of cancer progression in
    test animals â€“ which is helpful in developing treatments
-   It can also be used to determine the extent of spread of a cancer
    should it metastasise to another tissue

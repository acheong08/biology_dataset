RNA Interference

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is
roughly 20 â€“ 25 base pairs in length

siRNA interferes with the expression of genes by causing the mRNA
transcripts to be broken prior to translation

-   Â When theÂ siRNA is unwound, one strand (the passenger strand) is
    degraded and one strand (the guide strand) remains
-   The guide strand will hybridise to its complementary mRNA sequence
    and recruit a protein complex called RISC
-   RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) will then destroy the targeted
    mRNA, preventing translation of the associated gene

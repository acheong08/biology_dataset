Nervous System

The nervous system coordinates the actions of complex organisms via the
transmission of electrochemical signals

-   These signals are transmitted by a specialised network of cells
    called neurons

The nervous system can be divided into two main parts:

-   CNSÂ Â (Central nervous system)Â â€“ Made up of the brain and spinal
    cord
-   PNSÂ  (Peripheral nervous system)Â â€“ Made of peripheral nerves
    which link the CNS to the bodyâ€™s receptors and effectors

Main Components of the Human Nervous System

CNS versus PNS

The central nervous system integrates information received from
peripheral nerves and coordinates bodily responses

-   The majority of this activity occurs in the brain, but certain
    responses can be mediated by the spinal cord (reflex actions)

The peripheral nervous system sends information to the CNS via
sensoryÂ neurons and activates effectors via motor neuronsÂ 

-   The peripheral nerves for a particular region of the body feed into
    the spinal cord at a particular site (anatomical dermatome)
-   Consequently, damage to a particular region of the spine will affect
    all body parts innervated by nerves ventral to that region
-   Spinal injuries to the cervical region are most severe as more of
    the body is affected (C1 â€“ C4 injuries impair normal breathing)

White Matter versus Grey Matter

The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can be characterised
by two distinct regions â€“ white matter and grey matter

-   White matter is composed of bundles of myelinated axons which
    connect the various grey matter regions together
-   Myelin acts as an insulator and hence nerve signals are transmitted
    at greater speed through white matter
-   Grey matter is composed of the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites,
    as well as unmyelinated nerve fibres
-   Grey matter functions as the regions of the brain where information
    is processed

Divisions of the Nervous System

The nervous system can be broken down into several sub-divisions:

-   Firstly, the nervous system can be separated into the central
    nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS)
-   The PNS can be divided into the sensory (afferent) pathway or the
    motor (efferent) pathway
-   The motor pathway can be divided according to whether the response
    is voluntary (somatic) or involuntary (autonomic)
-   Finally, the autonomic division can be split into sympathetic
    (â€˜fight or flightâ€™) or parasympathetic (â€˜rest and digestâ€™)
    responses

Hint: Â How do you remember the difference between the afferent and
efferent pathways when they sound the SAME?

-   SAME:Â Â Sensory neurons = Afferent pathway Â ; Â Motor neurons =
    Efferent pathway

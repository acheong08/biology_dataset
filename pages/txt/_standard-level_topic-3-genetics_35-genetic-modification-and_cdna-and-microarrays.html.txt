cDNA and Microarrays

Individuals can be screened for genetic diseases and cancers by using
cDNA and microarrays

-   This technology can also be used to investigate the protein
    expression pathways that lead to these conditions

cDNA

-   Complementary DNA (cDNA) is a molecule synthesised from an mRNA
    template via reverse transcription
-   cDNA molecules represent gene sequences that are actively
    transcribed by a cell (as they were synthesised from mRNA)Â 
-   This makes them a valuable tool for determining expression patterns
    of proteins in normal and diseased states

Microarray

-   A DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA sequences
    (oligos) attached to a solid surface
-   These sequences represent fractions of a large library of genes that
    are present in a cell
-   If a gene is active within a cell, then the cDNA (produced from the
    mRNA transcript) will bind to its complementary oligo
-   If the cDNA has been fluorescently labeled, then the complementary
    oligo can be identifiedÂ (along with the gene it represents)
-   If cDNA from healthy and diseased cells are labeled with different
    fluorophores, comparisons of gene expression can be made
-   Genes that are only active in a diseased or normal state will be of
    particular interest to scientists

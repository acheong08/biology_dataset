Fibrous vs Globular Proteins

There are two main classes of protein tertiary structure:

-   Fibrous proteinsÂ are generally composed of long and narrow strands
    and have a structural role (theyÂ areÂ something)
-   Globular proteinsÂ generally have a more compact and rounded shape
    and have functional roles (theyÂ doÂ something)

Operons

An operon is a sequence of DNA containing a cluster of genes under the
control of a single promoter

-   Hence, genes within an operon will always be expressed together or
    not at all (their expression patterns are linked)

There are three basic components to an operon

-   Promoter â€“ Upstream sequence to which RNA polymerase binds
-   Operator â€“ Segment of DNA to which a repressor protein binds
    (inhibits transcription by obstructing RNA polymerase)
-   Structural genes â€“ Genes that are collectively regulated by the
    operon

Operons are related to stimulons and regulons:

-   Stimulon â€“ Set of genes under regulation from a single cell
    stimulus
-   Regulon â€“ Set of genes under regulation from a single regulatory
    protein (each gene has a different operator though)

Originally, operons were thought to exist only in prokaryotes, however
examples have since been found in eukaryotes

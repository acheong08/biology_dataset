Understanding:

â€¢ Â Electron microscopes have a much higher resolution than light
microscopes

Â  Â Â 
Electron microscopes use electron beams focused by electromagnets to
magnify and resolve microscopic specimens

-   Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) generate high resolution
    cross-sections of objects
-   Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) display enhanced depth to map
    the surface of objects in 3D

Electron microscopes have two key advantages when compared to light
microscopes:

-   They have a much higher range of magnification (can detect smaller
    structures)
-   They have a much higher resolution (can provide clearer and more
    detailed images)

Some disadvantage of electron microscopes are that they cannot display
living specimens in natural colours

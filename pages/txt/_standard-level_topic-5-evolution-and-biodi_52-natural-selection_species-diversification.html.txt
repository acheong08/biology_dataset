Species Diversification

Evolution describes the cumulative changes that occur in the heritable
characteristics of a population

-   It can result in diversification within a species (microevolution)
    or diversification between species (macroevolution)

Microevolution

Microevolution describes evolutionary changes that occur within a short
period of geological time (e.g. between generations)

There are three main processes that promote variation within a
population (biodiversity):

-   Gene mutations: Â A change the genetic composition of an organism
    due to alterations in the DNA base sequence
-   Sexual reproduction: Â Introduces new gene combinations in offspring
    via random mating and meiotic divisions
-   Gene flow: Â The movement of alleles into (or out of) a population
    as a result of immigration or emigration

Variation within a gene pool can be reduced if conditions promote the
survival of certain traits and the removal of others

There are two main mechanisms for change which will reduce biodiversity
within a population:

-   Genetic drift: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as a
    result of a random or chance event
-   Natural selection: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as
    a result of differentially selective environmental pressures

Additionally, humans may change the composition of gene pools by
directly intervening in breeding processes (artificial selection)

Macroevolution

Macroevolution describes evolutionary changes that occur over relatively
long geological periods, resulting in speciation

-   Macroevolution involves changes in large populations and often is
    associated with significant environmental change
-   Not all populations undergo constant evolutionary modifications,
    some remain relatively unchanged (stasis)
-   When evolutionary changes prevent two related populations from
    interbreeding, then speciation has occurred

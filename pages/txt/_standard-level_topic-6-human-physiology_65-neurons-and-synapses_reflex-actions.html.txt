Reflex Actions

A reflex is a rapid and involuntary response to a stimulus, resulting
from a simple signalling pathway called a reflex arc

-   Reflex actions do not involve the brain â€“ instead sensory
    information is directly relayed to motor neurons within the spineÂ 
-   This results in a faster response, but one that does not involve
    conscious thought or deliberation

Reflex actions are particularly beneficial in survival situations, when
quick reactions are necessary to avoid permanent damage

-   A common example of a reflex action is the patellar reflex (â€˜knee
    jerkâ€™ response) that occurs when the patellar tendon is tapped
-   The patellar reflex is a common test employed by doctors to
    determine the presence of spinal lesionsÂ

1.3 Â Membrane Structure

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The structure of biological membranesÂ 
makes them fluid and dynamic

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Phospholipids form bilayers in water due to the amphipathic
    properties of phospholipid molecules
-   Membrane proteins are diverse in terms of structure, position in the
    membrane and function
-   Cholesterol is a component of animal cell membranes

Applications:

-   Cholesterol in mammalian membranes reduces membrane fluidity and
    permeability to some solutes

Skills:

-   Drawing of the fluid mosaic model
-   Analysis of evidence from electron microscopy that lead to the
    proposal of the Davson-Danielli model
-   Analysis of the falsification of the Davson-Danielli model that lead
    to the Singer-Nicolson model

C3, C4 and CAM Plants

The Calvin cycle uses the enzyme Rubisco (RuBP carboxylase) to fix CO₂
to RuBP and make a 3C compound (GP)

-   Plants that fix carbon dioxide directly from the air are called C₃
    plants (as the initial product is a 3C compound)

Rubisco can also use oxygen (O₂) as an alternative substrate to undergo
a series of reactions known as photorespiration

-   Photorespiration creates a product that cannot be used to make
    sugars and hence reduces the efficiency of the Calvin cycle
-   Photorespiration reduces levels of photosynthesis by up to ~25% in
    C₃ plants, reducing energy yield in these plants

C₄ and CAM Plants

Because oxygen acts as a competitive inhibitor for Rubisco,
photosynthesis in C₃ plants is reduced in the presence of oxygen

-   C₃ plants are less efficient in hot and dry regions, as stomata must
    remain closed to prevent excessive water loss
-   When stomata are closed, O₂ cannot diffuse out of the leaf,
    increasing O₂ concentration relative to CO₂

In these hot and arid conditions, other types of plants have evolved to
limit the exposure of Rubisco to oxygen

-   C₄ and CAM plantsÂ uses the enzyme PEP carboxylase to combine CO₂ to
    a 3C compound (PEP) and make a 4C compound
-   PEP carboxylase has a higher affinity for CO₂ than Rubisco and
    doesnâ€™t bind to oxygen at all
-   These plants can then transfer the CO₂Â (stored in the 4C compound)
    to regions with low oxygen concentrations

In the C₄ pathway, carbon dioxide is physically separated from oxygen in
order to improve CO₂ binding to RubiscoÂ 

-   The CO₂ is converted to a 4C compound and then sequestered to a
    deeper tissue layer where less oxygen is present
-   In this deeper tissue layer, the CO₂ is released and can enter the
    Calvin cycle without competition from oxygen

In the CAM pathway, carbon dioxide reserves are created (temporal
isolation) in order to improve CO₂ binding to Rubisco

-   CAM plants are adapted to arid environments where water loss is high
    and stomata must remain closed during the day
-   The CO₂ is converted into a 4C compound during the night, when
    stomata are open and CO₂ is able to diffuse into the leaf
-   This allows reserves of CO₂ to be created for use during the day,
    when stomata are closed and O₂ cannot be released

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mitosis is division of the nucleus into two genetically identical
daughter nuclei

Â  Â Â 
The cell cycle is an ordered set of events which culminates in the
division of a cell into two daughter cells

-   It can be roughly divided into two main phases:

Interphase

The stage in the development of a cell between two successive divisions

This phase of the cell cycle is a continuum of three distinct stages:

-   G¹ â€“ First intermediate gap stage in which the cell grows and
    prepares for DNA replication
-   S â€“ Synthesis stage in which DNA is replicated
-   G² â€“ Second intermediate gap stage in which the cell finishes
    growing and prepares for cell division

M phase

The period of the cell cycle in which the cell and contents divide to
create two genetically identical daughter cells

This phase is comprised of two distinct stages:

-   Mitosis â€“ Nuclear division, whereby DNA (as condensed chromosomes)
    is separated into two identical nuclei
-   Cytokinesis â€“ Cytoplasmic division, whereby cellular contents are
    segregated and the cell splits into two

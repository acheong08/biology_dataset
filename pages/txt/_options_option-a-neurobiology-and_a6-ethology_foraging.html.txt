â€¢ Â Foraging behaviour in shore crabs as an example of increasing
chances of survival by optimal prey choice

Â  Â Â 
Foraging is the act of searching for (and potentially finding) food
resources in nature

-   As availability and abundance of food resources vary, animals must
    adapt their foraging practices to account for any changes
-   Animals with optimal foraging strategies will have more available
    energy with which to survive and reproduceÂ 

According to the optimal foraging theory, animals will adopt strategies
that:

-   Minimise the cost of foraging (i.e. the amount of energy used to
    capture and consume prey)
-   Maximise the benefits to the consumer (i.e. the amount of energy
    yielded by a particular food source)

Shore crabs demonstrate selectivity in the type of mussel foraged when
the mussel population is abundant:

-   Crabs will ignore smaller mussels (as the energy yield is less than
    that obtained from larger mussels)
-   Crabs will also ignore larger mussels (difficult to crush, also
    risks potential damage to the crabâ€™s claws)
-   Crabs will selectively identify and feed on mid-sized mussels
    (provided the mussel supply is in abundance)Â

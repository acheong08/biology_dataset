Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of biochemicals such as sugars, lipids or amino
acids from molecular diagrams

Â  Â Â 
Carbohydrates

The structure of complex carbohydrates may vary depending on the
composition of monomeric subunits

Polysaccharides may differ according to the type of monosaccharide they
possess and the way the subunits bond together

-   Glucose monomers can be combined to form aÂ variety of different
    polymers â€“ including glycogen, cellulose and starch

Lipids

Lipids can be roughly organised into one of three main classes:

-   Simple (neutral) lipids â€“ Esters of fatty acids and alcohol (e.g.
    triglycerides and waxes)
-   Compound lipids â€“ Esters of fatty acids, alcohol and additional
    groups (e.g. phospholipids and glycolipids)Â 
-   Derived lipids â€“ Substances derived from simple or compound lipids
    (e.g. steroids and carotenoids)

Three Main Types of Lipids

Proteins

Amino acids join together by peptide bonds which form between the amine
and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids

The fusion of two amino acids creates a dipeptide, with further
additions resulting in the formation of a polypeptide chain

-   The subsequent folding of the chain depends on the order of amino
    acids in a sequence (based on chemical properties)

Formation of a Dipeptide

Nucleic Acids

Nucleotides form bonds between the pentose sugar and phosphate group to
form long polynucleotide chains

-   In DNA, two complementary chains will pair up via hydrogen bonding
    between nitrogenous bases to form double strands
-   This double stranded molecule may then twist to form a double
    helical arrangement

Leaf Tissue

Below is a microscopic cross-section of a typical leaf (taken from a
dicotyledonous plant)

-   Distribution of tissues may differ between different types of plants
    according to functional requirements

Key Features:

-   Palisade mesophyll is the site of photosynthesis and hence is
    located on the upper surface of the leaf (facing sunlight)
-   Spongy mesophyll is the main site of gas exchange and is hence
    located on the lower surface of the leaf (near stomata)
-   Stomata are on the underside of the leaf (prevents obstruction so as
    to maintain an open channel for gas exchange)
-   The top surface of the leaf is covered by a thick, waxy cuticle
    (prevents water absorption which would affect transpiration)
-   Vascular bundles (including xylem and phloem) are located centrally
    to allow for optimal access by all leaf cells

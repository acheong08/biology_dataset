â€¢ Â Initiation of translation involves assembly of the components that
carry out the process

Â  Â Â 
Initiation

The first stage of translation involves the assembly of the three
components that carry out the process (mRNA, tRNA, ribosome)

-   The small ribosomal subunit binds to the 5â€™-end of the mRNA and
    moves along it until it reaches the start codon (AUG)
-   Next, the appropriate tRNA molecule bind to the codon via its
    anticodon (according to complementary base pairing)
-   Finally, the large ribosomal subunit aligns itself to the tRNA
    molecule at the P site and forms a complex with the small subunit

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synthesis of the polypeptide involves a repeated cycle of events

Â  Â Â 
Elongation

-   A second tRNA molecule pairs with the next codon in the ribosomal A
    site
-   The amino acid in the P site is covalently attached via a peptide
    bond (condensation reaction) to the amino acid in the A site
-   The tRNA in the P site is now deacylated (no amino acid), while the
    tRNA in the A site carries the peptide chain

Translocation

-   The ribosome moves along the mRNA strand by one codon position (in a
    5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction)
-   The deacylated tRNA moves into the E site and is released, while the
    tRNA carrying the peptide chain moves to the P site
-   Another tRNA molecules attaches to the next codon in the now
    unoccupied A site and the process is repeated

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Disassembly of the components follows termination of translation

Â  Â Â 
Termination

The final stage of translation involves the disassembly of the
components and the release of a polypeptide chain

-   Elongation and translocation continue in a repeating cycle until the
    ribosome reaches a stop codonÂ 
-   These codons do not recruit a tRNA molecule, but instead recruit a
    release factor that signals for translation to stop
-   The polypeptide is released and the ribosome disassembles back into
    its two independent subunits

Please Note:
In this animation the release factor is represented as being similar to
a tRNA molecule
In reality, the release factor is a protein and would appear quite
dissimilar to a tRNA moleculeÂ

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of anaerobic cell respiration in yeasts to produce ethanol and
carbon dioxide in baking

Â  Â Â 
Anaerobic respiration (fermentation) involves the breakdown of
carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen
In yeasts, fermentation results in the production of ethanol and carbon
dioxide â€“ which can be used in food processing:

-   Bread â€“ Carbon dioxide causes dough to rise (leavening), the
    ethanol evaporates during baking
-   Alcohol â€“ Ethanol is the intoxicating agent in alcoholic beverages
    (concentrations above ~14% damage the yeast)

Bacterial cultures can also undergo fermentation to produce a variety of
food products

-   Yogurt / Cheese â€“ Bacteria produce lactic acid anaerobically,
    which modifies milk proteins to generate yogurts and cheeses

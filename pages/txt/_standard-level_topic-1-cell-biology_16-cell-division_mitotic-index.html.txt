â€¢ Â Determination of a mitotic index from a micrograph

Â  Â Â 
The mitotic index is a measure of the proliferation status of a cell
population (i.e. the proportion of dividing cells)Â 

The mitotic index may be elevated during processes that promote
division, such as normal growth or cellular repair

-   It also functions as an important prognostic tool for predicting the
    response of cancer cells to chemotherapy

Identifying Mitotic Cells

Cells undergoing mitosis will lack a clearly defined nucleus and possess
visibly condensed chromosomes

-   Prophase â€“ Chromosomes condensed but still confined to a nuclear
    region
-   Metaphase â€“ Chromosomes aligned along the equator of the cell
-   Anaphase â€“ Two distinct clusters of chromosomes apparent at poles
    of the cell
-   Telophase â€“ Two nuclear regions present within a single cell
    (difficult to see as cytokinesis occurs concurrently)

Calculating Mitotic Index

The mitotic index is the ratio between the number of cells in mitosis
and the total number of cells

It can be determined by analysing micrographs and counting the relative
number of mitotic cells versus non-dividing cells

Models of Action

There are two models used to describe the way enzymes interact with
substrates:

-   The 'lock and keyâ€™Â model
-   TheÂ â€˜induced fitâ€™Â model

The Lock and Key Model

According to the lock and key model, the enzymeâ€™s active site
complements the substrate precisely

The substrate fits a particular active site like a key fits into a
particular lock

This theory of enzyme-substrate interaction explains how enzymes
exhibitÂ specificityÂ for a particular substrate

The Induced Fit Model

According to the induced fit model, the enzymeâ€™s active site is not a
completely rigid fit for the substrate

Instead, the active site will undergo aÂ conformational changeÂ when
exposed to a substrate to improve binding

This theory of enzyme-substrate interactions has two advantages compared
to the lock and key model:

-   It explains how enzymes may exhibitÂ broad specificityÂ (e.g. lipase
    can bind to a variety of lipids)
-   It explains how catalysis may occur (the conformational change
    stresses bonds in the substrate, increasing reactivity)

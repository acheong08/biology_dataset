Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nerve impulses are action potentials propagated along the axons
ofÂ neurons

Â  Â Â 
Nerve impulses are action potentials that move along the length of an
axon as a wave of depolarisation

-   Depolarisation occurs when ion channels open and cause a change in
    membrane potential
-   The ion channels that occupy the length of the axon are
    voltage-gated (open in response to changes in membrane potential)
-   Hence, depolarisation at one point of the axon triggers the opening
    of ion channels in the next segment of the axon
-   This causes depolarisation to spread along the length of the axon as
    a unidirectional â€˜waveâ€™

Propagation of a Nerve Impulse

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Propagation of nerve impulses is the result of local currents that
cause each successive part of the axon to

Â  Â Â reach the threshold potential

Â  Â Â 
Action potentials are generated within the axon according to the
all-or-none principle

-   An action potential of the same magnitude will always occur provided
    a minimum electrical stimulus is generated
-   This minimum stimulus â€“ known as the threshold potentialÂ (â€“55
    mV) â€“ is the level required to open voltage-gated ion channelsÂ 
-   If the threshold potential is not reached, an action potential
    cannot be generated and hence the neuron will not fire

Threshold potentials are triggered when the combined stimulation from
the dendrites exceeds a minimum level of depolarisation

-   If the overall depolarisation from the dendrites is sufficient to
    activate voltage-gated ion channels in one section of the axon, the
    resulting displacement of ions should be sufficient to trigger the
    activation of voltage-gated ion channels in the next axon section

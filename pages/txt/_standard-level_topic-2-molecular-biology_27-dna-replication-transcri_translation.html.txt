Understanding:

â€¢ Â Translation is the synthesis of polypeptides on ribosomes

â€¢ Â Translation depends on complementary base pairing between codons
on mRNA and anticodons on tRNA

Â  Â Â 
Translation is the process of protein synthesis in which the genetic
information encoded in mRNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids
on a polypeptide chain

-   Ribosomes bind to mRNA in the cytoplasm and move along the molecule
    in a 5â€™Â â€“ 3â€™Â direction until it reaches a start codon (AUG)
-   Anticodons on tRNA molecules align opposite appropriate codons
    according to complementary base pairing (e.g. AUG = UAC)
-   Each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid (according to the
    genetic code)
-   Ribosomes catalyse the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent
    amino acids (via condensation reactions)
-   The ribosome moves along the mRNA molecule synthesising a
    polypeptide chain until it reaches a stop codon
-   At this point translation ceases and the polypeptide chain is
    released

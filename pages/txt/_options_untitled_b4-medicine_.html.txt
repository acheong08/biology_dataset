[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Biotechnology can be used in theÂ 
diagnosis and treatment of disease

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Infections by a pathogen can be detected by the presence of its
    genetic material or by its antigens
-   Predisposition to a genetic disease can be detected through the
    presence of markers
-   DNA microarrays can be used to test for genetic predisposition or to
    diagnose the disease
-   Metabolites that indicate disease can be detected in blood and urine
-   Tracking experiments are used to gain information about the
    localization and interaction of a desired protein
-   Biopharming uses genetically modified animals and plants to produce
    proteins for therapeutic use
-   Viral vectors can be used in gene therapy

Applications:

-   Use of PCR to detect different strains of influenza virus
-   Tracking tumour cells using transferrin linked to luminescent probes
-   Biopharming of antithrombin
-   Use of viral vectors in the treatment of Severe Combined
    Immunodeficiency (SCID)

Skills:

-   Analysis of a simple microarray
-   Interpretation of the results of an ELISA diagnostic test

1.2 Â Ultrastructure of Cells

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Eukaryotes have a much more complexÂ 
cell structure than prokaryotes

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Prokaryotes have a simple cell structure without
    compartmentalisation
-   Eukaryotes have a compartmentalised cell structure
-   Electron microscopes have a much higher resolution than light
    microscopes

Applications:

-   Structure and function of organelles within exocrine gland cells of
    the pancreas and within palisade mesophyll cells of the leaf
-   Prokaryotes divide by binary fission

Skills:

-   Drawing of the ultrastructure of prokaryotic cells based on electron
    micrographs
-   Drawing of the ultrastructure of eukaryotic cells based on electron
    micrographs
-   Interpretation of electron micrographs to identify organelles and
    deduce the function of specialised cells

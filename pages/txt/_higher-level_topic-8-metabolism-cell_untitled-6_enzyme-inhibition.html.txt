Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzyme inhibitors can be competitive or non-competitive

Â  Â Â 
An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that disrupts the normal reaction
pathway between an enzyme and a substrate

-   Enzyme inhibitors can be either competitive or non-competitive
    depending on their mechanism of action

Types of Enzyme Inhibition

Enzyme inhibitors prevent the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex
and hence prevent the formation of product

-   Inhibition of enzymes may be either reversible or irreversible
    depending on the specific effect of the inhibitor being used

Normal Enzyme Reaction

-   In a normal reaction, a substrate binds to an enzyme (via the active
    site) to form an enzyme-substrate complex
-   The shape and properties of the substrate and active site are
    complementary, resulting in enzyme-substrate specificity
-   When binding occurs, the active site undergoes a conformational
    change to optimally interact with the substrate (induced fit)
-   This conformational change destabilises chemical bonds within the
    substrate, lowering the activation energy
-   As a consequence of enzyme interaction, the substrate is converted
    into product at an accelerated rate

Competitive Inhibition

-   Competitive inhibition involves a molecule, other than the
    substrate, binding to the enzymeâ€™s active site
-   The molecule (inhibitor) is structurally and chemically similar to
    the substrate (hence able to bind to the active site)
-   The competitive inhibitor blocks the active site and thus prevents
    substrate binding
-   As the inhibitor is in competition with the substrate, its effects
    can be reduced by increasing substrate concentration

[competitive inhibition]

Noncompetitive Inhibition

-   Non-competitive inhibition involves a molecule binding to a site
    other than the active site (an allosteric site)
-   The binding of the inhibitor to the allosteric site causes a
    conformational change to the enzymeâ€™s active site
-   As a result of this change, the active site and substrate no longer
    share specificity, meaning the substrate cannot bind
-   As the inhibitor is not in direct competition with the substrate,
    increasing substrate levels cannot mitigate the inhibitorâ€™s effect

Examples of Enzyme Inhibition

Enzyme inhibitors can serve a variety of purposes, including in medicine
(to treat disease) and agriculture (as pesticides)

-   An example of a use for a competitive inhibitor is in the treatment
    of influenza via the neuraminidase inhibitor, Relenza^(TM)Â 
-   An example of a use for a non-competitive inhibitor is in the use of
    cyanide as a poison (prevents aerobic respiration)

Relenza (Competitive Inhibitor)

-   Relenza is a synthetic drug designed by Australian scientists to
    treat individuals infected with the influenza virus
-   Virions are released from infected cells when the viral enzyme
    neuraminidase cleaves a docking protein (haemagglutinin)
-   Relenza competitively binds to the neuraminidase active site and
    prevents the cleavage of the docking protein
-   Consequently, virions are not released from infected cells,
    preventing the spread of the influenza virus

Cyanide (Noncompetitive Inhibitor)

-   Cyanide is a poison which prevents ATP production via aerobic
    respiration, leading to eventual death
-   It binds to an allosteric site on cytochrome oxidase â€“ a carrier
    molecule that forms part of the electron transport chain
-   By changing the shape of the active site, cytochrome oxidase can no
    longer pass electrons to the final acceptor (oxygen)
-   Consequently, the electron transport chain cannot continue to
    function and ATP is not produced via aerobic respiration

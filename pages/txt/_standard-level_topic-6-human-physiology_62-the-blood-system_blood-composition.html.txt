Blood Composition

Blood is the fluid medium in which materials are transported around the
body via bloodÂ vessels

-   An average adult human contains roughly 5 â€“ 6 litres of blood
    (approximately 77 mls per kilogram)

When blood is fractionated by centrifugation, three key elements become
apparent

-   Fractionated blood contains roughly 55% plasma, 45% red blood cells
    and less than 1% forms a buffy coat

Plasma

-   Consists mainly of water, which dissolves materials and functions as
    a transport medium
-   Contains electrolytes (minerals that carry a charge), which are
    important for maintaining fluid balance and blood pH
-   Proteins in the blood plasma maintain osmotic potential (albumin),
    transport lipids (globulin) and help clot (fibrinogen)
-   Blood plasma also functions to transport various materials needed by
    the body and wastes produced by body cells

Red Blood Cells

-   Red blood cells (erythrocytes) are responsible for transporting
    oxygen around the body
-   Oxygen is bound to haemoglobin at the lungs and released from the
    red blood cell at respiring body tissues

Buffy Coat

-   The buffy coat is the fraction of a blood sample that contains white
    blood cells and platelets
-   White blood cells (leukocytes) are involved in the bodyâ€™s immune
    defence (eliminating infections)
-   Platelets (thrombocytes) are involved in blood clotting (repairing
    damaged vessels to prevent blood loss)

Composition of Blood Plasma

Various materials Â are transported in the plasma for use by the body,
including:

[nacho uh]

Nutrients â€“ needed by cells to make chemical energy (e.g. glucose)

Antibodies â€“ involved in pathogen identification and elimination

Carbon dioxide â€“ waste produced as a by-product of cell respiration

Hormones â€“ chemical messengers that move through the bloodstream

Oxygen â€“ required by body tissues in order to respire aerobically

Urea â€“ compound that is excreted to remove nitrogen from the body

Heat â€“ not a molecule, but still an important component of blood
plasma

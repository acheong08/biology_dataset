Understanding:

â€¢ Â Learned behaviour can spread through a population or be lost from
it more rapidly than innate behaviour

Â  Â Â 
Learned behaviour describes the process of acquiring new knowledge or
skills (which can be improved with practice)

-   Learned behaviour is dependent on environmental context and can
    disappear over time if the context is absent

Innate behaviour describes instinctive responses that are ingrained in
an animal (it is encoded in the DNA)

-   It can only be modified by genetic change (mutation) which would
    take place over many generations

Application:

â€¢ Â Feeding on cream from milk bottles in blue tits as an example of
the development and loss of learned

Â  Â Â behaviour

Â  Â Â 
At the start of the 20th century, two bird species in the UK â€“ blue
tits and robins â€“ would feed on cream from milk bottles

-   These bottles had no lids, allowing the birds easy access to the top
    layer of cream

Eventually, aluminium seals were placed over the tops of the milk
bottles to close access to this food source

-   The blue tit population as a whole learnt how to penetrate the foil
    lids, whereas the robins as a population did not

This difference in learning development is attributed to the different
social organisation of the two bird populations

-   Blue tits are flock birds and hence were more likely to observe and
    pass on newly acquired skills
-   Robins are territorial (solitary) birds and could not effectively
    propagate the information within the population

The ability to pierce the seals and siphon the cream has since been lost
from the blue tit population

-   Milk is now capped with a plastic lid and is no longer delivered so
    the situational context is no longer present
-   Blue tits have a relatively short life span, so a learned behaviour
    can be removed from the population rapidly

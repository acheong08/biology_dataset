Understanding:

â€¢ Â Membrane proteins are diverse in terms of structure, position in
the membrane and function

Â  Â Â 
PhospholipidÂ bilayers are embedded with proteins, which may be either
permanently or temporarily attached to the membrane

-   Integral proteins are permanently attached to the membrane and are
    typically transmembrane (they span across the bilayer)
-   Peripheral proteins are temporarily attached by non-covalent
    interactions and associate with one surface of the membrane Â

Structure of Membrane Proteins

The amino acids of a membrane protein are localised according to
polarity:

-   Non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids associate directly with the
    lipid bilayerÂ 
-   Polar (hydrophilic) amino acids are located internally and face
    aqueous solutions

Transmembrane proteins typically adopt one of two tertiary structures:Â 

-   Single helices / helical bundlesÂ 
-   Beta barrels (common in channel proteins)

Functions of Membrane Proteins

Membrane proteins can serve a variety of key functions:

-   Junctions â€“ Serve to connect and join two cells togetherÂ 
-   Enzymes â€“ Fixing to membranes localises metabolic pathwaysÂ 
-   Transport â€“ Responsible for facilitated diffusion and active
    transportÂ 
-   Recognition â€“ May function as markers for cellular
    identificationÂ 
-   Anchorage â€“ Attachment points for cytoskeleton and extracellular
    matrixÂ 
-   Transduction â€“ Function as receptors for peptide hormonesÂ

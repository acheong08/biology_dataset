Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mitosis and cell division in the shoot apex provide cells needed
for extension of the stem and development

Â  Â Â of leaves

Â  Â Â 
The apical meristems give rise to primary growth (lengthening) and
occurs at the tips of the roots and shoots

-   Growth at these regions is due to a combination of cell enlargement
    and repeated cell division (mitosis and cytokinesis)
-   Differentiation of the dividing meristem gives rise to a variety of
    stem tissues and structures â€“ including leaves and flowers

In the stem, growth occurs in sections called nodes â€“ with the
remaining meristem tissue forming an inactive axillary bud

-   These axillary (lateral) buds have the potential to form new
    branching shoots, complete with leaves and flowers

Apical Growth in Shoots and Roots

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plant hormones control growth in the shoot apex

Â  Â Â 
The growth of the stem and the formation of new nodes is controlled by
plant hormones released from the shoot apex

-   One of the main groups of plant hormones involved in shoot and root
    growth areÂ auxins (e.g. indole-3-acetic acid / IAA)

When auxins are produced by the shoot apical meristem, it promotes
growth in the shoot apex via cell elongation and division

-   The production of auxins additionally prevents growth in lateral
    (axillary) buds, a condition known as apical dominance
-   Apical dominance ensures that a plant will use its energy to grow up
    towards the light in order to outcompete other plants
-   As the distance between the terminal bud and axillary bud increases,
    the inhibition of the axillary bud by auxin diminishes
-   Different species of plants will show different levels of apical
    dominance

Application:

â€¢ Â Models of water transport in xylem using apparatus including
filter paper, porous pots or capillary tubing

Â  Â Â 
The movement of water up the length of the xylem can be modelled using a
number of simple apparatus

-   These include capillary tubing, filter or blotting paper and porous
    pots

Capillary Tubing:

-   Water has the capacity to flow along narrow spaces in opposition to
    external forces like gravity (capillary action)
-   This is due to a combination of surface tension (cohesive forces)
    and adhesion with the walls of the tube surface
-   The thinner the tube or the less dense the fluid, the higher the
    liquid will rise (xylem vessels are thin: 20 â€“ 200 Âµm)Â 

Filter Paper:

-   Filter paper (or blotting paper) will absorb water due to both
    adhesive and cohesive properties
-   When placed perpendicular to a water source, the water will hence
    rise up along the length of the paper
-   This is comparable to the movement of water up a xylem (the paper
    and the xylem wall are both composed of cellulose)

Porous Pots:

-   Porous pots are semi-permeable containers that allow for the free
    passage of certain small materials through pores
-   The loss of water from the pot is similar to the evaporative water
    loss that occurs in the leaves of plants
-   If the porous pot is attached by an airtight seal to a tube, the
    water loss creates a negative pressure that draws more liquid

Skill:

â€¢ Â Measurement of transpiration rates usingÂ potometers

Â  Â Â 
A potometer is a device that is used to estimate transpiration rates by
measuring the rate of water loss / uptake Â 

-   When a plant is affixed to theÂ potometer, transpiration can be
    indirectly identified by the movement of water towards the plant
-   This water movement can be assessed as a change in meniscus level or
    by the movement of an air bubble towards the plant
-   The initial starting position of the meniscus or air bubble can be
    adjusted by introducing additional water from a reservoirÂ 

When measuring transpiration rates with aÂ potometer, it is important to
remember that not all water is lost to transpiration

-   A small amount of water (~2%) is used in photosynthesis and to
    maintain the viable turgidity of plant cells

Skill:

â€¢ Â Design of an experiment to test hypotheses about the effect of
temperature or humidity on transpiration rates

Â  Â Â 
Potometers can be used to test a number of variables that may affect the
rate of transpiration in plants

-   These variables include temperature, humidity, light intensity and
    wind exposure

Temperature:

-   Increasing the ambient temperature is predicted to cause an increase
    in the rate of transpiration
-   Higher temperatures lead to an increase in the rate of water
    vaporisation within the mesophyll, leading to more evaporation
-   The effect of temperature variation can be tested experimentally by
    using heaters or submerging in heated water baths

Humidity:

-   Increasing the humidity is predicted to cause a decrease in the rate
    of transpiration
-   Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the air â€“ less vapour
    will diffuse from the leaf if there is more vapour in the air
-   The effect of humidity can be tested experimentally by encasing the
    plant in a plastic bag with variable levels of vapour

Light Intensity:

-   Increasing the light intensity to which a plant is exposed is
    predicted to cause an increase in the rate of transpiration
-   Increasing light exposure will cause more stomata to open in order
    to facilitate photosynthetic gas exchange
-   The effect of light intensity can be tested experimentally by
    placing the plant at variable distances from a lamp

Wind Exposure:

-   Increasing the level of wind exposure is predicted to cause an
    increase in the rate of transpiration
-   Wind / air circulation will function to remove water vapour from
    near the leaf, effectively reducing proximal humidity
-   The effect of wind can be tested experimentally by using fans to
    circulate the air around a plant

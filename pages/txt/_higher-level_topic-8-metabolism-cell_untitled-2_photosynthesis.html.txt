Understanding:

â€¢ Â Light dependent reactions take place in the intermembrane space of
the thylakoids

â€¢ Â Light independent reactions take place in the stroma

Photosynthesis is the process by which cells synthesise organic
molecules (e.g. glucose) from inorganic molecules (CO₂ and H₂O) in the
presence of sunlight
This process requires a photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll) and can
only occur in certain organisms (plants, some bacteria)

-   In plants, photosynthesis occurs within a specialised organelle
    called theÂ chloroplast

Photosynthesis Equation

[photosynthesis equation]

Photosynthesis is a two step process:

-   The light dependent reactions convert light energy from the Sun into
    chemical energy (ATP)
-   The light independent reactions use the chemical energy to
    synthesise organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates)

Step 1:Â Â Light Dependent Reactions

-   Light is absorbed by chlorophyll, which releases energised electrons
    that are used to produce ATP (chemical energy)
-   The electrons are donated to carrier molecules (NADP⁺), which is
    used (along with ATP) in the light independent reactionsÂ 
-   The electrons lost from the chlorophyll are replaced by water, which
    is split (photolysis) to produce oxygen and hydrogen
-   The light dependent reactions occur in the intermembraneÂ space of
    membranous discs called thylakoids

Step 2:Â Â Light Independent Reactions

-   ATP and hydrogen / electrons (carried by NADPH) are transferred to
    the site of the light independent reactions
-   The hydrogen / electrons are combined with carbon dioxide to form
    complex organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates)
-   The ATP provides the required energy to power these anabolic
    reactions and fix the carbon molecules together
-   The light independent reactions occur within the fluid-filled
    interior of the chloroplast called the stroma

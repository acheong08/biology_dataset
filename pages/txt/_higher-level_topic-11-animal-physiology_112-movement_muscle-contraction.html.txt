Understanding:

â€¢ Â Calcium ions and the proteins tropomyosin and troponin control
muscle contractions

Â  Â Â 
The process of muscular contraction occurs over a number of key steps,
including:

-   Depolarisation and calcium ion release
-   Actin and myosin cross-bridge formationÂ 
-   Sliding mechanism of actin and myosin filaments
-   Sarcomere shortening (muscle contraction)

1. Â Depolarisation and Calcium Ion Release

-   An action potential from a motor neuron triggers the release of
    acetylcholine into the motor end plate
-   Acetylcholine initiates depolarisation within the sarcolemma, which
    is spread through the muscle fibre via T tubulesÂ 
-   Depolarisation causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release stores
    of calcium ions (Ca²⁺)
-   Calcium ions play a pivotal role in initiating muscular contractions

2.Â Â Actin and Myosin Cross-Bridge Formation

-   On actin, the binding sites for the myosin heads are covered by a
    blocking complex (troponin and tropomyosin)
-   Calcium ions bind to troponin and reconfigure the complex, exposing
    the binding sites for the myosin heads
-   The myosin heads then form a cross-bridge with the actin filaments

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The contraction of the skeletal muscle is achieved by the sliding
of actin and myosin filaments

â€¢ Â ATP hydrolysis and cross bridge formation are necessary for the
filaments to slide

Â  Â Â 
3. Â Sliding Mechanism of Actin and Myosin

-   ATP binds to the myosin head, breaking the cross-bridge between
    actin and myosin
-   ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to change position and
    swivel, moving them towards the next actin binding site
-   The myosin heads bind to the new actin sites and return to their
    original conformation
-   This reorientation drags the actin along the myosin in a sliding
    mechanism
-   The myosin heads move the actin filaments in a similar fashion to
    the way in which an oar propels a row boat

4. Â Sarcomere Shortening

-   The repeated reorientation of the myosin heads drags the actin
    filaments along the length of the myosin
-   As actin filaments are anchored to Z lines, the dragging of actin
    pulls the Z lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere
-   As the individual sarcomeres become shorter in length, the muscle
    fibres as a whole contracts

Summary of Muscle Contractions

-   Action potential in a motor neuron triggers the release of Ca²⁺ ions
    from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
-   Calcium ions bind to troponin (on actin) and cause tropomyosin to
    move, exposing binding sites for the myosin heads
-   The actin filaments and myosin heads form a cross-bridge that is
    broken by ATP
-   ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to swivel and change
    orientation
-   Swiveled myosin heads bind to the actin filament before returning to
    their original conformation (releasing ADP + Pi)
-   The repositioning of the myosin heads move the actin filaments
    towards the centre of the sarcomere
-   The sliding of actin along myosin therefore shortens the sarcomere,
    causing muscle contraction

Please Note:
In this animation the myosin head is attached to actin when ATP
hydrolysis causes it to swivel
In reality, the myosin head swivels when unattached and then returns to
its original conformation following actin binding

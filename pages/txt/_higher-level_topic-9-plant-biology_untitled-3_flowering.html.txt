Understanding:

â€¢ Â Flowering involves a change in gene expression in the shoot apex

Â  Â Â 
Flowers are the reproductive organs of angiospermophytes (flowering
plants) and develop from the shoot apex

-   Changes in gene expression trigger the enlargement of the shoot
    apical meristem
-   This tissue then differentiates to form the different flower
    structures â€“ sepals, petals, stamen and pistil

The activation of genes responsible for flowering is influenced by
abiotic factors â€“ typically linked to the seasons

-   Flowering plants will typically come into bloom when a suitable
    pollinator is most abundantÂ 
-   The most common trigger for a change in gene expression is day/night
    length (photoperiodism)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In aquatic ecosystems carbon is present as dissolved carbon
dioxide and hydrogen carbonate ions

Â  Â Â 

[carbon ocean]

Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and some of it will remain as a
dissolved gas, however the remainder will combine with water to form
carbonic acidÂ  (CO₂ + H₂O Â â‡„ Â H₂CO₃)

-   Carbonic acid will then dissociate to form hydrogen carbonate ions
    Â (H₂CO₃ Â â‡„ Â HCO₃^(â€“) + H⁺)
-   This conversion also releases hydrogen ions (H⁺), which is why pH
    changes when CO₂ is dissolved in water (> acidic)

Autotrophs absorb both dissolved carbon dioxide and hydrogen carbonate
ions and use them to produce organic compoundsÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Animals such as reef-building corals and mollusca have hard parts
that are composed of calcium carbonate

Â  Â  and can become fossilised in limestone

Â  Â Â 

When the hydrogen carbonate ions come into contact with the rocks and
sediments on the ocean floor, they acquire metal ions

-   This commonly results in the formation of calcium carbonate and the
    subsequent development of limestone

Living animals may also combine the hydrogen carbonate ions with calcium
to form calcium carbonate

-   This calcium carbonate forms the hardened exoskeleton of coral, as
    well as forming the main component of mollusca shells
-   When the organism dies and settles to the sea floor, these hard
    components may become fossilised in the limestone

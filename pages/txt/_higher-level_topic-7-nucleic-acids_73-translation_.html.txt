7.3 Â Translation

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Information transferred from DNA to mRNAÂ 
is translated into an amino acid sequence

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Initiation of translation involves assembly of the components that
    carry out the process
-   Synthesis of the polypeptide involves a repeated cycle of events
-   Disassembly of the components follows termination of translation
-   Free ribosomes synthesise proteins for use primarily within the cell
-   Bound ribosomes synthesise proteins primarily for secretion or for
    use in lysosomes
-   Translation can occur immediately after transcription in prokaryotes
    due to the absence of a nuclear membrane
-   The sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide is the
    primary structure
-   The secondary structure is the formation of alpha helices and beta
    pleated sheets stabilised by hydrogen bonding
-   The tertiary structure is the further folding of the polypeptide
    stabilised by interactions between R groups
-   The quaternary structure exists in proteins with more than one
    polypeptide chain

Applications:

-   tRNA-activating enzymes illustrate enzyme-substrate specificity and
    the role of phosphorylation

Skills:

-   Identification of polysomes in electron micrographs of prokaryotes
    and eukaryotes
-   The use of molecular visualisation software to analyse the structure
    of eukaryotic ribosomes and a tRNA molecule

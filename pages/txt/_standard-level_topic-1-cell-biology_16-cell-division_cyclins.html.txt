â€¢ Â Cyclins are involved in the control of the cell cycle

Mechanism of Cyclin Action

Cyclins are a family of regulatory proteins that control the progression
of the cell cycle

Cyclins activate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), which control cell
cycle processes through phosphorylation

-   When a cyclin and CDK form a complex, the complex will bind to a
    target protein and modify it via phosphorylation
-   The phosphorylated target protein will trigger some specific event
    within the cell cycle (e.g. centrosome duplication, etc.)
-   After the event has occurred, the cyclin is degraded and the CDK is
    rendered inactive again

Cyclin Expression Patterns

Cyclin concentrations need to be tightly regulated in order to ensure
the cell cycle progresses in a proper sequence

-   Different cyclins specifically bind to, and activate, different
    classes of cyclin dependent kinases
-   Cyclin levels will peak when their target protein is required for
    function and remain at lower levels at all other times

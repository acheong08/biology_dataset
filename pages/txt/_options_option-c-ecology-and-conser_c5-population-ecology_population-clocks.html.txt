Population Clocks

Population clocks provide current projections of estimated populations
based on previously recorded data

-   This information is typically gathered from regional and national
    census data and hence may not be highly accurate

Population clocks may also use established data to assume rates of
change (e.g. growth rate and death rate)

-   This allows the clocks to show dynamic changes to population data
    (although this information may not be very accurate)

While of questionable accuracy and validity, population clocks can be
used as a tool for identifying changing demographics

-   The human population is currently growing at a rate unprecedented in
    world history (what is the carrying capacity of man?)

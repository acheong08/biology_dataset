Mitosis versus Meiosis

Mitosis and meiosis are two processes by which eukaryotic cells may
divide and share several similarities:

-   They are both preceded by interphase (which includes DNA
    replication)
-   They both divide according to a common pathway
    (prophaseÂ â†’Â metaphaseÂ â†’Â anaphaseÂ â†’Â telophase)
-   They both split their cells via cytokinesis

However there are certain key differences which distinguish the two
processes:

-   Division â€“ Mitosis involves only one cell division, but meiosis
    requires two cell divisions
-   Independent assortment â€“ Homologous pairs are randomly separated
    into separate cells in meiosis, but not mitosis
-   Synapsis â€“ Homologous pairs form bivalents in meiosis, but not
    mitosis
-   Crossing over â€“ Non-sister chromatids of homologous pairs may
    exchange genetic material in meiosis, but not mitosis
-   Outcome â€“ Mitosis results in the formation of two daughter cells,
    while meiosis produces four daughter cells
-   Ploidy â€“ Daughter cells produced by mitosis are diploid, while
    daughter cells produced by meiosis are haploid
-   Use â€“ Mitosis is used to clone body cells, while meiosis is used
    to generate sex cells (gametes)
-   Genetics â€“ Cells produced by mitosis are genetically identical
    (clones), while cells produced by meiosis are genetically distinct

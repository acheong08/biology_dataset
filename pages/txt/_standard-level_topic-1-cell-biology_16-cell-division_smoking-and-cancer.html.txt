â€¢ Â The correlation between smoking and incidence of cancers

Â  Â Â 
A significant body of scientific literature exists which provides a
strong linkÂ between smoking and the incidence of cancers

-   Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, over 60 of
    which are known to be carcinogenic

There appears to be a strong positive correlation between the frequency
of smoking and the development of cancer

-   The risk of lung cancer is strongly correlated with smoking, with
    ~90% of lung cancers attributable to tobacco use
-   Smoking also increases the risk of over a dozen other cancers,
    including mouth, stomach, liver, panceas and bowel

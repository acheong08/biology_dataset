Understanding:

â€¢ Â Undifferentiated cells in the meristems of plants allow
indeterminate growth

Â  Â Â 
Meristems are tissues in a plant consisting of undifferentiated cells
capable of indeterminate growth

-   They are analagous to totipotent stem cells in animals, except that
    they have specific regions of growth and development
-   Meristematic tissue can allow plants to regrow structures or even
    form entirely new plants (vegetative propagation)

Meristematic tissue can be divided into apical meristems and lateral
meristems:

-   Apical meristems occur at shoot and root tips and are responsible
    for primary growth (i.e. plant lengthening)
-   Lateral meristems occur at the cambium and are responsible for
    secondary growth (i.e. plant widening / thickening)
-   Apical meristems give rise to new leaves and flowers, while lateral
    meristems are responsible for the production of bark

Chromosome Types

Chromosomes are divided into two parts (p and q arms) with a
constriction point called a centromere in the middle

The centromere can be located in different positions and this forms the
basis for the four different classes of chromosome:

-   Metacentric â€“ centromere is in middle, meaning p and q arms are of
    comparable length (e.g. chromosomes 1, 3, 16, 19, 20)
-   Submetacentric â€“ centromere off-centre, leading to shorter p arm
    relative to q arm (e.g. chromosomes 2, 4 - 12, 17, 18, X)
-   Acrocentric â€“ centromere severely off-set from centre, leading to
    much shorter p arm (e.g. chromosomes 13 - 15, 21, 22, Y)
-   Telocentric â€“ centromere found at end of chromosome, meaning no p
    arm exists (chromosome not found in humans)

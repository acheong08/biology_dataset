â€¢ Â Identification of pneumocytes, capillary endothelium cells and
blood cells in light micrographs and electronÂ 

Â  Â Â micrographs of lung tissue

Â  Â Â 
The inner surface of the alveolus is lined by a special type of alveolar
cell called a pneumocyte

-   Type I pneumocytes are very thin in order to mediate gas exchange
    with the bloodstream (via diffusion)
-   Type IIÂ pneumocytes secrete a pulmonary surfactant in order to
    reduce the surface tension within the alveoli

Alveolar air spaces are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries,
which transport respiratory gases to and from the lungs

-   The capillaries are located close to the pneumocytes and are
    composed of a very thin, single-layer endothelium
-   The capillaries transport oxygen within red blood cells, while white
    blood cells may extravasate into the lung tissue

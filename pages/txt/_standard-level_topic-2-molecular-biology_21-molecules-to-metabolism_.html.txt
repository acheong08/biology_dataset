2.1 Â Molecules to Metabolism

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Living organisms control their compositionÂ 
by a complex web of chemical reactions

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Molecular biology explains living processes in terms of the chemical
    substances involved
-   Carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds allowing a diversity of
    stable compounds to exist
-   Life is based on carbon compounds including carbohydrates, lipids,
    proteins and nucleic acids
-   Metabolism is the web of all the enzyme-catalysed reactions in a
    cell or organism
-   Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler
    molecules including the formation of macromolecules from monomers by
    condensation reactions
-   Catabolism is the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler
    molecules including the hydrolysis of macromolecules into monomers

Applications:

-   Urea as an example of a compound that is produced by living
    organisms but can also be artificially synthesized

Skills:

-   Drawing molecular diagrams of glucose, ribose, a saturated fatty
    acid and a generalised amino acid
-   Identification of biochemicals such as sugars, lipids or amino acids
    from molecular diagrams

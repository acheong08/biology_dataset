Understanding:

â€¢ Â Endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in hepatocytes produce
plasma proteins

Â  Â Â 
Plasma proteins are proteins present in the blood plasma and are
produced by the liver (except for immunoglobulins)

-   The proteins are produced by the rough ER in hepatocytes and
    exported into the blood via the Golgi complex

There are a number of different types of plasma proteins, each serving
different specific functions:

-   Albumins regulate the osmotic pressure of the blood (and hence
    moderate the osmotic pressure of body fluids)
-   Globulins participate in the immune system (i.e. immunoglobulins)
    and also act as transport proteins
-   Fibrinogens are involved in the clotting process (soluble fibrinogen
    can form an insoluble fibrin clot)
-   Low levels of other plasma proteins have various functions
    (e.g.Â Î±-1-antitrypsin neutralises digestiveÂ trypsin)

Gene Editing

Gene editing involves the insertion, removal or replacement of DNA
within the genome of a living organism

-   The most precise, efficient and flexible method of gene editing
    currently available involves the CRISPR editing system

CRISPR is a short sequence of DNA which functions as a target for
CRISPR-associated nucleases (Cas nuclease)

-   CRISPR stands forÂ â€˜clustered regularly interspaced short
    palindromic repeatsâ€™
-   CRISPR provides bacterial immunity to viruses by flanking viral DNA
    sequences that have been integrated into the genome
-   The viral DNA isÂ transcribedÂ into an RNA sequence that â€“ via
    CRISPR â€“ associates with a Cas nuclease
-   The viral RNA andÂ Cas nuclease drift throughout the cell until the
    viral RNA identifies and binds to complementary viral DNA
-   This enables the Cas nuclease to target and destroy the viral DNA
    sequence, preventing infection

The CRISPR / Cas system has been modified to selectively remove any
targeted sequence, allowing for precise gene editing

-   TheÂ Cas protein is complexed with a synthetically derived guide RNA
    molecule that is complementary to a target sequence
-   The guide RNA will bind to the target sequence, prompting its
    excision by the Cas nuclease
-   Following the removal of the target sequence, another sequence of
    DNA can be integrated in its place (gene editing)

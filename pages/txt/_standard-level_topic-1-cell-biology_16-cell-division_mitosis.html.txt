Mitosis is the process of nuclear division, whereby duplicated DNA
molecules are arranged into two separate nuclei

Mitosis is preceded by interphase and is divided into four distinct
stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase

-   The division of the cell in two (cytokinesis) occurs concurrently
    with the final stage of mitosis (telophase)

Before Mitosis

[interphase]

Interphase:

-   DNA is present as uncondensed chromatin (not visible under
    microscope)
-   DNA is contained within a clearly defined nucleus
-   Centrosomes and other organelles have beenÂ duplicated
-   Cell is enlarged in preparation for division

Stages of Mitosis

[mitosis]

Prophase:

-   DNA supercoils and chromosomes condense (becoming visible under
    microscope)
-   Chromosomes are comprised of genetically identical sister chromatids
    (joined at a centromere)
-   Paired centrosomes move to the opposite poles of the cell and form
    microtubule spindle fibres
-   The nuclear membrane breaks down and the nucleus dissolves

Metaphase:

-   Microtubule spindle fibres from both centrosomes connect to the
    centromere of each chromosome
-   Microtubule depolymerisation causes spindle fibres to shorten in
    length and contract
-   This causes chromosomes to align along the centre of the cell
    (equatorial plane or metaphase plate)

Anaphase:

-   Continued contraction of the spindle fibres causes genetically
    identical sister chromatids to separate
-   Once the chromatids separate, they are each considered an individual
    chromosome in their own right
-   The genetically identical chromosomes move to the opposite poles of
    the cell

Telophase:

-   Once the two chromosome sets arrive at the poles, spindle fibres
    dissolve
-   Chromosomes decondense (no longer visible under light microscope)
-   Nuclear membranes reform around each chromosome set
-   Cytokinesis occurs concurrently, splitting the cell into two

â€¢ Â Analysis of data from experiments measuring phloem transport rates
using aphid stylets and radioactively-

Â  Â Â labelled carbon dioxide

Â  Â Â 
Aphids are a group of insects, belonging to the order Hemiptera, which
feed primarily on sap extracted from phloem

-   Aphids possess a protruding mouthpiece (called a stylet), which
    pierces the plantâ€™s sieve tube to allow sap to be extracted
-   The penetration of the stylet into the sieve tube is aided by
    digestive enzymes that soften the intervening tissue layers
-   If the stylet is severed, sap will continue to flow from the plant
    due to the hydrostatic pressure within the sieve tube

Measuring Phloem Transport

Aphids can be used to collect sap at various sites along a plant's
length and thus provide a measure of phloem transport rates

-   A plant is grown within a lab with the leaves sealed within a glass
    chamber containing radioactively-labelled carbon dioxide
-   The leaves will convert the CO₂ into radioactively-labelled sugars
    (via photosynthesis), which are transported by the phloem
-   Aphids are positioned along the plantâ€™s length and encouraged to
    feed on the phloem sap
-   Once feeding has commenced, the aphid stylet is severed and sap
    continues to flow from the plant at the selected positions
-   The sap is then analysed for the presence of radioactively-labelled
    sugars
-   The rate of phloem transport (translocation rate) can be calculated
    based on the time taken for the radioisotope to be detected at
    different positions along the plantâ€™s length

Factors Affecting Translocation Rate

The rate of phloem transport will principally be determined by the
concentration of dissolved sugars in the phloem

The concentration of dissolved sugars in the phloem sap will be affected
by:

-   The rate of photosynthesis (which is affected by light intensity,
    CO₂ concentration, temperature, etc.)
-   The rate of cellular respiration (this may be affected by any factor
    which physically stresses the plant)
-   The rate of transpiration (this will potentially determine how much
    water enters the phloem)
-   The diameter of the sieve tubes (will affect the hydrostatic
    pressure and may differ between plant species)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gene loci are said to be linked if on the same chromosome

Â  Â Â 
A linkage group is a group of genes whose loci are on the same
chromosome and hence donâ€™t independently assort

-   Linked genes will tend to be inherited together and hence donâ€™t
    follow normal Mendelian inheritance for a dihybrid cross
-   Instead the phenotypic ratio will be more closely aligned to a
    monohybrid cross as the two genes are inherited as a single unit
-   Linked genes may become separated via recombination (due to crossing
    over during synapsis in meiosis I)

Application:

â€¢ Â Morganâ€™s discovery of non-Mendelian ratios in Drosophila

Â  Â Â 
Thomas Hunt Morgan provided a key contribution to our current
understanding of gene linkage by discovering non-Mendelian ratios in
Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies)

-   His breeding experiments involving fruit flies clearly demonstrated
    that linked genes were not independently assorted

Sex Linkage

When cross-breeding red-eyed wild types with white-eyed mutants, he
discovered a clear sex bias in phenotypic distribution

-   All female offspring of a red-eyed male were red-eyed, whereas all
    male offspring of a white-eyed female were also white-eyed
-   Morgan described this distribution as 'sex-limitedâ€™Â inheritance
    and inferred it was caused by the gene for eye colour being located
    on a sex chromosome (i.e. X-linked)

Gene Linkage

Morgan went on to identify a number of different traits in fruit flies
that did not conform to Mendelian ratios

-   Certain phenotypic combinations occurred in much lower frequencies
    than was to be expected

Based on this data, Morgan made two key proposals:

-   The alleles for these traits were located on a shared chromosome
    (gene linkage) and hence did not independently assort
-   Linked alleles could be uncoupled via recombination (crossing over)
    to create alternative phenotypic combinations, but these new
    phenotypes would occur at a much lower frequency

Morgan also observed that the amount of crossing over between linked
genes differed depending on the combination of traits

-   This led to the idea that crossover frequency may be a product of
    the distance between two genes on a chromosome â€“Â genes with a
    higher crossover frequency are further apart, whereas genes with a
    lower crossover frequency are closer together
-   Morgan used this concept to develop the first gene linkage maps that
    showed the relative positions of genes on a chromosome

Gene Linkage and Recombination Frequencies

[]
      Crossover Site:                 None                 One
                 Two                  Three                  Four

From the above diagrams it can be seen that:Â 

-   LongÂ aristae and red eyes are more likely to be separated via
    recombination (high crossover frequency)
-   Long aristae and long legs are less likely to be separated via
    recombination (low crossover frequency)Â 

This indicates that the aristae and leg genes are located closer
together, whereas the eye gene is more distant

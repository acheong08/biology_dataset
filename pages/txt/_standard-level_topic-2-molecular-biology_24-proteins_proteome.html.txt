Understanding:

â€¢ Â Every individual has a unique proteome

Â  Â Â 
The proteome is the totality of proteins expressed within a cell, tissue
or organism at a certain time

-   The proteome of any given individual will be unique, as protein
    expression patterns are determined by an individualâ€™sÂ genes

The proteome is always significantly larger than the number of genes in
an individual due to a number of factors:

-   Gene sequences may be alternatively spliced following transcription
    to generate multiple protein variants from a single gene
-   Proteins may be modified (e.g. glycosylated, phosphorylated, etc.)
    following translation to promote further variations

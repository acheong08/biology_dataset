Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide and water vapour are the most significant
greenhouse gases

â€¢ Â Other gases including methane and nitrogen oxides have less impact

Â  Â Â 
Greenhouse gases absorb and emit long-wave (infrared) radiation, thereby
trapping and holding heat within the atmosphere

-   Greenhouse gases collectively make up less than 1% of the Earthâ€™s
    atmosphere

The greenhouse gases which have the largest warming effect within the
atmosphere are water vapour (clouds) and carbon dioxide

-   Water vapour is created via evaporation of water bodies (e.g.
    oceans) and transpiration â€“ it is removed via precipitation (rain)
-   Carbon dioxide is made by cell respiration and burning fossil fuels
    â€“ it is removed via photosynthesis and absorption by oceans

Other greenhouse gases include methane and nitrogen oxides â€“ these
have less impact on the overall warming effect

-   Methane is emitted from waterlogged habitats (like marshes) and
    landfills â€“ it is also a gaseous waste produced by ruminants
-   Nitrogen oxides are released naturally by certain bacteria and also
    is emitted in the exhaust by certain vehicles

Water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, but
is not produced as a product of human activity

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The impact of a gas depends on its ability to absorb long-wave
radiation as well as its concentration within

Â  Â Â the atmosphere

Â  Â Â 
There are two factors which determine how much of an the impact a
greenhouse gas will have in warming the atmosphere:

1. Â Ability to absorb long-wave radiation

-   Gases that have a greater capacity to absorb long-wave radiation
    will have a greater warming impact (per molecule)

2. Â Concentration within the atmosphere

-   The greater the concentration of a gas, the greater its warming
    impact will be within the atmosphere
-   The concentration of a gas will be determined by both its rate of
    release and persistence within the atmosphere

The overall impact of a greenhouse gas will be determined by the
combination of both these factors

-   Methane has a larger capacity to absorb long-wave radiation than
    carbon dioxide, but is significantly less abundant
-   Water vapour enters the atmosphere rapidly but only remains for
    short periods, while carbon dioxide persists for years
-   Human activity is increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (except
    water vapour) and hence increasing their impact

1.1 Â Introduction to Cells

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The evolution of multicellular organisms allowedÂ 
cell specialisation andÂ cell replacement

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   According to the cell theory, living organisms are composed of cells
-   Organisms consisting of only one cell carry out all the functions of
    life in that cell
-   Surface area to volume ratio is important in the limitation of cell
    size
-   Multicellular organisms have properties that emerge from the
    interaction of their cellular components
-   Specialised tissues can develop by cell differentiation in
    multicellular organisms
-   Differentiation involves the expression of some genes and not others
    in a cellâ€™s genome
-   The capacity of stem cells to divide and differentiate along
    different pathways is necessary in embryonic development and also
    makes stem cells suitable for therapeutic uses

Applications:

-   Questioning the cell theory using atypical examples, including
    striated muscle, giant algae and aseptate fungal hyphae
-   Investigation of functions of life in Paramecium and one named
    photosynthetic unicellular organism
-   Use of stem cells to treat Stargardtâ€™s disease and one other named
    condition
-   Ethics of theÂ therapeutic use of stem cells from specially created
    embryos, from the umbilical cord blood of a new-born baby and from
    an adultâ€™s own tissues

Skills:

-   Use of a light microscope to investigate the structure of cells and
    tissues, with drawing of cells
-   Calculation of the magnification of drawings and the actual size of
    structures and ultrastructures shown in drawings or micrographs

Germination is the process by which a seed emerges from a period of
dormancy and begins to sprout

For germination to occur, a seed requires a combination of:

-   Oxygen â€“ for aerobic respiration (the seed requires large amounts
    of ATP in order to develop)
-   Water â€“ to metabolically activate the seed (triggers the synthesis
    of gibberellin)
-   Temperature â€“ seeds require certain temperature conditions in
    order to sprout (for optimal function of enzymes)
-   pH â€“ seeds require a suitable soil pH in order to sprout (for
    optimal function of enzymes)

Additionally, certain plant species may require additional conditions
for germination:

-   Fire â€“ some seeds will only sprout after exposure to intense heat
    (e.g. after bushfires remove established flora)
-   Freezing â€“ some seeds will only sprout after periods of intense
    cold (e.g. in spring, following the winter snows)
-   Digestion â€“ some seeds require prior animal digestion to erode the
    seed coat before the seed will sprout
-   Washing â€“ some seeds may be covered with inhibitors and will only
    sprout after being washed to remove the inhibitors
-   Scarification â€“ seeds are more likely to germinate if the seed
    coat is weakened from physical damage

Experiments can be developed using any of these factors as an
independent variable

-   Germination can be measured by the rate of seed growth over a set
    period of time

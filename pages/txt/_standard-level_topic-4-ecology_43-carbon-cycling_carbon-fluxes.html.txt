â€¢ Â Estimation of carbon fluxes due to processes in the carbon cycle

Â  Â Â 
Carbon fluxes describe the rate of exchange of carbon between the
various carbon sinks / reservoirs

-   There are four main carbon sinks â€“ lithosphere (earth crust),
    hydrosphere (oceans), atmosphere (air), biosphere (organisms)

The rate at which carbon is exchanged between these reservoirs depends
on the conversion processes involved:

-   Photosynthesis â€“ removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
    fixes it in producers as organic compoundsÂ 
-   Respiration â€“ releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when
    organic compounds are digested in living organisms
-   Decomposition â€“ releases carbon products into the air or sediment
    when organic matter is recycled after death of an organism
-   Gaseous dissolution â€“ the exchange of carbon gases between the
    ocean and atmosphere
-   Lithification â€“ the compaction of carbon-containing sediments into
    fossils and rocks within the Earthâ€™s crust (e.g. limestone)
-   Combustion â€“ releases carbon gases when organic hydrocarbons
    (coal, oil and gas) are burned as a fuel source

It is not possible to directly measure the size of the carbon sinks or
the fluxes between them â€“ instead estimates are made

-   Global carbon fluxes are very large and are therefore measured
    inÂ gigatonnes (1 gigatonne of carbon = 1 billion metric tonnes)
-   Because carbon fluxes are large and based on measurements from many
    different sources, estimates have large uncertaintiesÂ 

Global Carbon Fluxes

[carbon flux]

Estimating carbon fluxes requires an understanding of the factors that
can affect the exchange of carbon between different sinks

-   Some of the main causes for flux change include climate conditions,
    natural events and human activityÂ 

Climate Conditions

-   Rates of photosynthesis will likely by higher in summer seasons, as
    there is more direct sunlight and longer days
-   Oceanic temperatures also determine how much carbon is stored as
    dissolved CO₂ or as hydrogen bicarbonate ions
-   Climate events like El Nino and La Nina will change the rate of
    carbon flux between ocean and atmosphere
-   Melting of polar ice caps will result in the decomposition of frozen
    detritus

Natural Events

-   Forest fires can release high levels of carbon dioxide when plants
    burn (loss of trees also reduces photosynthetic carbon uptake)
-   Volcanic eruptions can release carbon compounds from the Earthâ€™s
    crust into the atmosphere

Human Activity

-   Clearing of trees for agricultural purposes (deforestation) will
    reduce the removal of atmospheric CO₂ via photosynthesis
-   Increased numbers of ruminant livestock (e.g. cows) will produce
    higher levels of methane
-   The burning of fossil fuels will release carbon dioxide into the
    atmosphere

Application:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data from air monitoring stations to explain annual
fluctuations

Â  Â Â 
Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations have been measured at the Mauna Loa
Observatory (in Hawaii) since 1958 by Charles Keeling

From these continuous and regular measurements a clear pattern of carbon
flux can be seen:

-   CO₂ levels fluctuate annually (lower in the summer months when long
    days and more light increase photosynthetic rates)
-   Global CO₂ trends will conform to northern hemisphere patterns as it
    contains more of the planetâ€™s land mass (i.e. more trees)
-   CO₂ levels are steadily increasing year on year since the industrial
    revolution (due to increased burning of fossil fuels)
-   Atmospheric CO₂ levels are currently at the highest levels recorded
    since measurements began

Changes in Carbon Dioxide Levels (Keeling Curve)

[keeling curve]

Data is now being regularly collected at a variety of field stations
globally, using standardised measurement techniques

-   All stations show a clear upward trend in atmospheric CO₂
    concentrations year on year, with annual fluctuations
-   Different monitoring stations may have slightly different trends due
    to seasonal variations and the distribution of local vegetation

Analysing Carbon Data

Carbon data can be plotted and analysed using the online database at
CDIAC (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre)

-   This website stores data on atmospheric CO₂ levels, which can be
    imported into an Excel spreadsheet in order to graph

How to use the CDIAC database:

-   Access the CDIAC website (click on the link to redirect)
-   Click onÂ â€˜Atmospheric Trace Gases and Aerosolsâ€™
    (underÂ â€˜Data' tab at top of page)
-   SelectÂ â€˜Carbon dioxideâ€™ from the list of greenhouse gases
-   Choose a monitoring station / network (e.g. Scripps Institution of
    Oceanography Network)
-   Download data from a particular site (e.g. South Pole, Antarctica)
-   Paste data of interest into an Excel spreadsheet to produce a
    graphical display (e.g. Jan 2000 â€“ Dec 2007)

Using the conditions listed above, the following carbon data was plotted
using Excel:

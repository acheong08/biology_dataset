Understanding:

â€¢ Â Sex is determined by sex chromosomes and autosomes are chromosomes
that do not determine sex

Â  Â Â 
In humans, sex is determined by a pair of chromosomes called the sex
chromosomes (or heterosomes)

-   Females possess two copies of a large X chromosome (XX)
-   Males possess one copy of an X chromosome and one copy of a much
    shorter Y chromosome (XY)

The Y chromosome contains the genes for developing male sex
characteristics (specifically the SRY gene)

-   In its absence of a Y chromosome, female sex organs will develop
-   The sex chromosomes are homologous in females (XX) but are not
    homologous in males (XY)

Hence the father is always responsible for determining the sex of
offspring:

-   If the male sperm contains an X chromosome, the growing embryo will
    develop into a girl
-   If the male sperm contains a Y chromosome, the growing embryo will
    develop into a boy
-   In all cases the female egg will contain an X chromosome (as the
    mother is XX)Â 

The remaining chromosomes in the organism are called autosomes (they do
not determine sex)

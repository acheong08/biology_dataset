Role of Environment

The phenotype is the observable characteristics or traits of an organism

-   It is predominantly determined by the organismâ€™s genotype (allele
    combination) for each particular feature

However environmental factors may also influence the expression of
characteristics

-   Hydrangeas change colour depending on the pH of the soil (acidic
    soil = blue flower ; alkaline soil = pink flower)
-   Human skin colour is determined by the expression of melanin
    pigment, but levels can change depending on sun exposureÂ

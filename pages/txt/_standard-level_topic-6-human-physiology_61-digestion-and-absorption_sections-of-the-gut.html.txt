The intestines are a long continuous tube â€“ running from stomach to
anus â€“ where the absorption of nutrients and water occurs

-   The intestines can be divided into the small intestines (nutrient
    absorption) and large intestines (water absorption)

Small Intestines

The small intestine is comprised of three distinct regions: duodenum,
jejunum and ileum
Duodenum

-   First segment of the small intestine which is fed by digestive
    fluids from the pancreas and gall bladder
-   Bile emulsifies fat globules into smaller droplets and pancreatic
    juice contains digestive enzymes
-   Sodium bicarbonate is released from the pancreas to neutralise
    stomach acids such that intestinal pH is ~ 7

Jejunum

-   Second segment of the small intestine where the digestive process is
    largely completed
-   Pancreatic enzymes and enzymes released from intestinal glands
    complete the break down of sugars, proteins and lipids

Ileum

-   Final segment of the small intestine with the principal function of
    nutrient absorption
-   The intestinal tract is highly folded (villi and microvilli) to
    increase surface area and optimise material absorption
-   Bile is also absorbed here and returned to the liver via blood
    vessels

Large Intestine

The principal function of the large intestine is to absorb any remaining
water and mineral ions

-   The large intestine is divided into the ascending colon, transverse
    colon, descending colon, sigmoidal colon and rectum
-   The appendix is also considered a part of the large intestine
    although it is a vestigial remnant without an important function

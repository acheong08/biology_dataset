Understanding:

â€¢ Â Triglycerides are formed by condensation from three fatty acids
and one glycerol

Â  Â Â 
Triglycerides are the largest class of lipids and function primarily as
long-term energy storage molecules

-   Animals tend to store triglycerides as fats (solid), while plants
    tend to store triglycerides as oils (liquid)

Triglycerides are formed when condensation reactions occur between one
glycerol and three fatty acids

-   The hydroxyl groups of glycerol combine with the carboxyl groups of
    the fatty acids to form an ester linkage
-   This condensation reaction results in the formation of three
    molecules of water

Triglycerides can be either saturated or unsaturated, depending on the
composition of the fatty acid chains

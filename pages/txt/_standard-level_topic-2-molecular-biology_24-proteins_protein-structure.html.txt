Understanding:

â€¢ Â The amino acid sequence determines the three-dimensional
conformation of a protein

Â  Â Â 
Amino acids are covalently joined via peptide bonds to form long chains
called polypeptides

The order of the amino acid sequence is called the primary structure and
determines the way the chain will fold

-   Different amino acid sequences will fold into different
    configurations due to the chemical properties of the variable side
    chains

Amino acid sequences will commonly fold into two stable configurations,
called secondary structures

-   Alpha helices occur when the amino acid sequence folds into a coil /
    spiral arrangement
-   Beta-pleated sheets occur when the amino acid sequence adopts a
    directionally-oriented staggered strand conformation

BothÂ Î±-helices andÂ Î²-pleated sheets result from hydrogen bonds
forming between non-adjacent amine and carboxyl groups

-   Where no secondary structure exists, the polypeptide chain will form
    a random coil

Secondary Structure â€“ Alpha Helices versus Beta Pleated Sheets

[secondary structure]

The overall three-dimensional configuration of the protein isÂ referred
to as theÂ tertiary structureÂ of the protein

The tertiary structure of a polypeptide chain will be determined by the
interactions between the variable side chains

-   These interactions may include hydrogen bonds, disulphide bridges,
    ionic interactions, polar associations, etc.

The affinity or repulsion of side chains will affect the overall shape
of the polypeptide chain and are determined by the position of specific
amino acids within a sequence

-   Hence, the order of the amino acid sequence (primary structure)
    determines all subsequent levels of protein folding

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A protein may consist of a single polypeptide or more than one
polypeptide linked together

Â  Â Â 
Certain proteins possess a fourth level of structural organisation
called a quaternary structure

Quaternary structures are found in proteins that consist of more than
one polypeptide chain linked togetherÂ 

Alternatively, proteins may have a quaternary structure if they include
inorganic prosthetic groups as part of their structure

Not all proteins will have a quaternary structure â€“ many proteins
consist of a single polypeptide chain

Quaternary Structure of a Protein

[quaternary structure]

An example of a protein with a quaternary structure is haemoglobin (O₂
carrying molecule in red blood cells)

-   Haemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide chains (two alpha chains
    and two beta chains)
-   It is also composed of iron-containing haeme groups (prosthetic
    groups responsible for binding oxygen)

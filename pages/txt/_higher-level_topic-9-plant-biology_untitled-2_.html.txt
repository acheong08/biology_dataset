9.3 Â Growth in Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Plants adapt their growthÂ 
to environmental conditions

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Undifferentiated cells in the meristems of plants allow
    indeterminate growth
-   Mitosis and cell division in the shoot apex provide cells needed for
    extension of the stem and development of leaves
-   Plant hormones control growth in the shoot apex
-   Plant shoots respond to the environment by tropisms
-   Auxin efflux pumps can set up concentration gradients of auxin in
    plant tissue
-   Auxin influences cell growth rates by changing the pattern of gene
    expression

Applications:

-   Micropropagation of plants using tissues from the shoot apex,
    nutrient agar gels and growth hormones
-   Use of micropropagation for rapid bulking up of new varieties,
    production of virus-free strains of existing varieties and
    propagation of orchids and other rare species

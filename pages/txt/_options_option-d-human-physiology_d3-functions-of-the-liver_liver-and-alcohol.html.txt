Liver and Alcohol

Alcohol is metabolised by the liver to form products that may be toxic
to the hepatocytes

-   Alcohol consumption also reduces cellular antioxidant activity,
    reducing the liverâ€™s capacity for detoxification

Over time, healthy liver cells are replaced by damaged cells, which
reduces the livers ability to:

-   Metabolise the bodyâ€™s supply of carbohydrates, fats and proteins
-   Produce bile and recycle red blood cells
-   Transport materials around the body (blood flow becomes blocked to
    and from the liver)

Long term alcohol abuse will result in three primary effects upon the
liver:

-   Inflammation â€“ swelling of damaged liver tissue causes the liver
    to become enlarged
-   Fat accumulation â€“ there is a build up of fatty deposits in place
    of normal tissue, blocking blood flow
-   Cirrhosis â€“ Scar tissue is created by the deposition of collagen
    where tissue is damagedÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Antibiotics block processes that occur in prokaryotic cells but
not in eukaryotic cells

â€¢ Â Viruses lack a metabolism and cannot therefore be treated with
antibiotics

Â  Â Â 
Antibiotics are compounds that kill or inhibit the growth of microbes
(specifically bacteria) by targeting prokaryotic metabolism

-   Metabolic features that may be targeted by antibiotics include key
    enzymes, 70S ribosomes and components of the cell wall
-   Because eukaryotic cells do not possess these features, antibiotics
    will target the pathogenic bacteria and not the infected host
-   Antibiotics may either kill the invading bacteria (bactericidal) or
    suppress its potential to reproduce (bacteriostatic)

Viruses do not possess a metabolism (they are not alive) and instead
take over the cellular machinery of infected host cells

-   As such, they cannot be treated with antibiotics and must instead be
    treated with specific antiviral agents
-   Antiviral treatments target features specific to viruses (e.g. viral
    enzymes like reverse transcriptase or components of the capsid)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some strains of bacteria have evolved with genes that confer
resistance to antibiotics and some strains of Â 

Â  Â Â bacteria have multiple resistance

Â  Â Â 
Since the discovery of the first antibiotic in 1928, antibiotic
compounds have been used to treat a variety of bacterial infections

-   Antibiotics can be narrow spectrum (effective against specific
    bacteria) or broad spectrum (effective against many bacteria)

Some strains of bacteria have evolved with genes that confer resistance
to antibiotics and some strains have multiple resistance

-   Genes may confer resistance by encoding traits that degrade the
    antibiotic, block its entry, increase its removal or alter the
    target
-   Because bacteria reproduce at a rapid rate, resistant strains of
    bacteria can proliferate very quickly following the initial mutation
-   Additionally, resistant strains can pass resistance genes to
    susceptible strains via bacterial conjugation (horizontal gene
    transfer)

The prevalance of resistant bacterial strains is increasing rapidly with
human populations due to a number of factors:

-   Antibiotics are often over-prescribed (particularly broad-spectrum
    drugs) or misused (e.g. given to treat a viral infection)
-   Many antibiotics are freely available without a prescription and
    certain antibiotics are commonly included in livestock feed
-   Multi-drug resistant bacteria are especially common in hospitals
    (i.e. nosocomial infections) where antibiotic use is high

An example of an antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria is Golden Staph
(MRSA â€“ Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus)

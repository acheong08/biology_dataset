6.3 Â Defence Against Infectious Disease

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The human body has structures and processes that
resist the continuous threat of invasion by pathogens

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The skin and mucous membranes form a primary defence against
    pathogens that cause infectious disease
-   Cuts in the skin are sealed by blood clotting
-   Clotting factors are released from platelets
-   The cascade results in the rapid conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin
    by thrombin
-   Ingestion of pathogens by phagocytic white blood cells gives
    non-specific immunity to disease
-   Production of antibodies by lymphocytes in response to particular
    pathogens gives specific immunity
-   Antibiotics block processes that occur in prokaryotic cells but not
    in eukaryotic cells
-   Viruses lack a metabolism and cannot therefore be treated with
    antibiotics
-   Some strains of bacteria have evolved with genes that confer
    resistance to antibiotics and some strains of bacteria have multiple
    resistance

Applications:

-   Causes and consequences of blood clot formation in coronary arteries
-   Florey and Chainâ€™s experiments to test penicillin on bacterial
    infections in mice
-   Effects of HIV on the immune system and methods of transmission

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Acid conditions in the stomach favor some hydrolysis reactions and
help to control pathogens in ingested food

Â  Â Â 
The gastric glands that line the stomach wall secrete an acidic solution
that creates a low pH environment within the stomach

-   The normal pH of the stomach is roughly 1.5 â€“ 2.0, which is the
    optimum pH for hydrolysis reactions by stomach enzymes

The acid conditions in the stomach serve a number of functions:

-   Assists in the digestion of food (by dissolving chemical bonds
    within food molecules)
-   Activates stomach proteases (e.g. pepsin is activated when
    pepsinogen is proteolytically cleaved in acid conditions)
-   Prevents pathogenic infection (stomach acids destroy microorganisms
    in ingested food)

The stomach wall is lined by a layer of mucus, which protects the
stomach lining from being damaged by the acid conditions

-   The pancreas releases bicarbonate ions into the duodenum which
    neutralises the stomach pH (intestinal pH ~7.0 â€“ 8.0)
-   Certain foods (e.g. antacids) may also neutralise stomach acids,
    impairing digestion and increasing chances of infection

Application:

â€¢ Â The reduction of stomach acid secretion by proton pump inhibitor
drugs

Â  Â Â 
The low pH environment of the stomach is maintained by proton pumps in
the parietal cells of the gastric pits

-   These proton pumps secrete H⁺ ions (via active transport), which
    combine with Cl^(â€“) ions to form hydrochloric acid
-   Certain medications and disease conditions can increase the
    secretion of H⁺ ions, lowering the pH in the stomach

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs which irreversibly bind to the
proton pumps and prevent H⁺ ion secretion

-   This effectively raises the pH in the stomach to prevent gastric
    discomfort caused by high acidity (e.g. acid reflux)
-   Individuals taking PPIs may have increased susceptibility to gastric
    infections due to the reduction of acid secretion

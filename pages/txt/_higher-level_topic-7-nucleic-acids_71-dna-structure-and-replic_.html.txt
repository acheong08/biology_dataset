7.1 Â DNA Structure and Replication

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The structure of DNA is Â 
ideally suited to its function

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   DNA structure suggested a mechanism for DNA replication
-   DNA replication is carried out by a complex system of enzymes
-   DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3â€™Â end of a primer
-   DNA replication is continuous on the leading strand and
    discontinuous on the lagging strand
-   Some regions of DNA do not code for proteins but have other
    important functions
-   Nucleosomes help to supercoil the DNA

Applications:

-   Rosalind Franklinâ€™s and Maurice Wilkinsâ€™Â investigation of DNA
    structure by X-ray diffraction
-   Use of nucleotides containing dideoxyribonucleic acid to stop DNA
    replication in preparation of samples for base sequencing
-   Tandem repeats are used in DNA profiling

Skills:

-   Analysis of results of the Hershey and Chase experiment providing
    evidence that DNA is the genetic material
-   Utilisation of molecular visualisation software to analyse the
    association between protein and DNA within the nucleosome

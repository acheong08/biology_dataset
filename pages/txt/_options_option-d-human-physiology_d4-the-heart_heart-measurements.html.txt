Heart Measurements

Diagnostic measurements can be taken using a range of devices to test
the efficiency of the cardiovascular system

-   Two common tests performed are auscultation and blood pressure
    measurements

Auscultation

-   Auscultation involves listening to the internal sounds of body
    organs, by using a stethoscope
-   Auscultation is commonly used to listen to the different heart
    sounds in order to assess the health of the heart
-   By placing the stethoscope at different points on the chest, the
    closure of each of the four heart valves can be heard
-   This allows physicians to determine if the heart is functioning
    normallyÂ

Blood Pressure

Blood pressure measurements include two readings â€“ a systolic pressure
and a diastolic pressure

-   The systolic pressure is a higher value that represents the pressure
    in the vessel when the heart is contracting (i.e. pulse flow)
-   The diastolic pressure is a lower value that represents the pressure
    in the vessel when the heart is relaxing

Blood pressure is measured in arteries using a sphygmomanometer (veins
do not have sufficient pressure to be easily detected)

-   The sphygmomanometer is a blood pressure cuff that cuts off
    circulation to a region (typically the brachial artery in the arm)
-   The pressure of the cuff is slowly released until a pulse can be
    audibly detected with a stethoscope (systolic pressure)Â 
-   The pressure continues to be released from the cuff until a pulse
    can no longer be audibly detected (diastolic pressure)
-   A normal blood pressure for a healthy adult is approximately 120 /
    80 mmHg

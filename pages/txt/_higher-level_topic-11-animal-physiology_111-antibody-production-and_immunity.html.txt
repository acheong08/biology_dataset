Understanding:

â€¢ Â Immunity depends on the persistance of memory cells

Â  Â Â 
The adaptive immune system relies on the clonal expansion of plasma
cells to produce sufficiently large numbers of antibodies

-   This means there is a delay between the initial exposure to a
    pathogen and the production of large quantities of antibodies
-   If pathogens can reproduce rapidly during this delay period, they
    can impede normal body functioning and cause disease

Memory cells are produced to prevent this delay in subsequent exposures
and hence prevent disease symptoms developing

-   When a B lymphocyte is activated and divides to form plasma cells, a
    small proportion will differentiate into memory cells
-   Memory cells are long living and will survive in the body for many
    years, producing low levels of circulating antibodies
-   If a second infection with the same pathogen occurs, memory cells
    will react more vigorously to produce antibodies faster
-   As antibodies are produced faster, the pathogen cannot reproduce in
    sufficient amounts to cause disease symptoms
-   Hence, because pathogen exposure no longer causes the disease to
    occur, the individual is said to be immune

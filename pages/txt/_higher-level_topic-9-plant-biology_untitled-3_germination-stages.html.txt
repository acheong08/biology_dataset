Germination Stages

The first step in the germination process is the metabolic activation of
a dormant seed

-   Germination begins with the absorption of water, which causes
    gibberellin to be produced
-   Gibberellin triggers the synthesis of amylase, which breaks down
    starch into maltose
-   Maltose is either hydrolysed (to glucose) for energy, or polymerised
    (to cellulose) for cell wall formation
-   This energy and cellular building blocks is used to promote cell
    division and the growth of a nascent shoot

Once the seed is metabolically activated, germination proceeds according
to the following stages:

-   The seed coat (testa) ruptures and the embryonic root (radicle)
    grows into the ground to extract key nutrients and minerals
-   The cotyledon emerges and produces the growing shootâ€™s first
    leaves
-   The growing plant can be divided into the epicotyl (embryonic
    shoot), hypocotyl (embryonic stem) and developing roots

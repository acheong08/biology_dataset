Understanding:

â€¢ Â In the Krebs cycle, the oxidation of acetyl groups is coupled to
the reduction of hydrogen carriers, liberating

Â  Â Â carbon dioxide

Â  Â Â 
The second stage of aerobic respiration is the Krebs cycle, which occurs
within the matrix of the mitochondria

-   The Krebs cycle is also commonly referred to as the citric acid
    cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle

In the Krebs cycle, acetyl CoA transfers its acetyl group to a 4C
compound (oxaloacetate) to make a 6C compound (citrate)

-   Coenzyme A is released and can return to the link reaction to form
    another molecule of acetyl CoA

Over a series of reactions, the 6C compound is broken down to reform the
original 4C compound (hence, a cycle)

-   Two carbon atoms are released via decarboxylation to form two
    molecules of carbon dioxide (CO₂)
-   Multiple oxidation reactions result in the reduction of hydrogen
    carriers (3Â Ã— NADH + H⁺ ; 1Â Ã— FADH₂)
-   One molecule of ATP is produced directly via substrate level
    phosphorylation

As the link reaction produces two molecules of acetyl CoA (one per each
pyruvate), the Krebs cycle occurs twice

-   Per glucose molecule, the Krebs cycle produces: Â 4Â Ã— CO₂ Â ;
    Â 2Â Ã— ATP Â ; Â 6Â Ã— NADH + H⁺ Â ; Â 2Â Ã— FADH₂

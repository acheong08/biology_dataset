8.2 Â Cell Respiration

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Energy is converted to a
usable form in cell respiration

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Cell respiration involves the oxidation and reduction of electron
    carriers
-   Phosphorylation of molecules makes them less stable
-   In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate in the cytoplasm
-   Glycolysis gives a small net gain of ATP without the use of oxygen
-   In aerobic cell respiration pyruvate is decarboxylated
    andÂ oxidised, and converted intoÂ acetyl compound and attached to
    coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A in the link reaction
-   In the Krebs cycle, the oxidation of acetyl groups is coupled to the
    reduction of hydrogen carriers, liberating carbon dioxide
-   Energy released by oxidation reactions is carried to the cristae of
    the mitochondria by reduced NAD and FAD
-   Transfer of electrons between carriers in the electron transport
    chain in the membrane of the cristae is coupled to proton pumping
-   In chemiosmosis protons diffuse through ATP synthase to generate ATP
-   Oxygen is needed to bind with the free protons to maintain the
    hydrogen gradient, resulting in the formation of water
-   The structure of the mitochondrion is adapted to the function it
    performs

Applications:

-   Electron tomography used to produce images of active mitochondria

Skills:

-   Analysis of diagrams of the pathways of aerobic respiration to
    deduce where decarboxylation and oxidation reactions occur
-   Annotation of a diagram of a mitochondrion to indicate the
    adaptations to its function

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing and labelling a diagram of the human kidney

Â  Â Â 
The kidney functions as the bloodâ€™s filtration and water balancing
system â€“ it removes metabolic wastes for excretion

-   Blood enters the kidneys via the renal artery and exits the kidneys
    via the renal vein
-   Blood is filtered by specialised structures called nephrons which
    produce urine
-   The urine is transported from the kidneys via the ureter, where it
    is stored by the bladder prior to excretion

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The composition of blood in the renal artery is different from
that in the renal vein

Â  Â Â 
The kidney contains specialised structures called nephrons which
function to filter the blood and eliminate wastes

-   Consequently, the composition of blood entering the kidney (via
    renalÂ artery) differs to that exiting the kidney (via renal vein)

Blood in the renal vein (i.e. after the kidney) will have:

-   Less urea (large amounts of urea is removed via the nephrons to form
    urine)
-   Less water and solutes / ions (amount removed will depend on the
    hydration status of the individual)
-   Less glucose and oxygen (not eliminated, but used by the kidney to
    generate energy and fuel metabolic reactions)
-   More carbon dioxide (produced by the kidneys as a by-product of
    metabolic reactions)

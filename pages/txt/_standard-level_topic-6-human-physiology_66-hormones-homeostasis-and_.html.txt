6.6 Â Hormones, Homeostasis and Reproduction

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Hormones are used when
signals need to be widely distributed

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Insulin and glucagon are secreted byÂ Î² and Î±Â cells of the
    pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentration
-   Thyroxin is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the metabolic
    rate and help control body temperature
-   Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and act on the
    hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite
-   Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland to control circadian
    rhythms
-   A gene on the Y chromosome causes embryonic gonads to develop as
    testes and secrete testosterone
-   Testosterone causes pre-natal development of male genitalia and both
    sperm production and development of male secondary sexual
    characteristics during puberty
-   Estrogen and progesterone cause pre-natal development of female
    reproductive organs and female secondary sexual characteristics
    during puberty
-   The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback
    mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones

Applications:

-   Causes and treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes
-   Testing of leptin on patients with clinical obesity and reasons for
    the failure to control the disease
-   Causes of jet lag and use of melatonin to alleviate it
-   The use in IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones,
    followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce
    superovulation and establish a pregnancy
-   William Harveyâ€™s investigation of sexual reproduction in deer

Skills:

-   Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show
    names of structures and their functions

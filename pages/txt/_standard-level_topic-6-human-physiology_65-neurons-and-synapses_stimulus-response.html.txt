Stimulus-Response

The basic pathway for a nerve impulse is described by the stimulus
response model

-   A stimulus is a change in the environment (either external or
    internal) that is detected by a receptor
-   Receptors transform environmental stimuli into electrical nerve
    impulses
-   These impulses are then transmitted via neurons to the central
    nervous systemÂ where decision-making occurs
-   When a response is selected (consciously or unconsciously), the
    signal is transmitted viaÂ neurons to effectors
-   Effectors are organs (either muscles or glands) that produce a
    response to a stimulus
-   A response is a change in the organism resulting from the detection
    of a stimulus

Overview of the Stimulus-Response Pathway

[stimulus-response]

Three types of neurons are required to transmit information via the
stimulus-response pathway:

-   Sensory neurons transmit information from sensory receptors to the
    central nervous system (CNS)
-   Relay neurons (interneurons) transmit information within the CNS as
    part of the decision-making process
-   Motor neurons transmit information from the CNS to effectors
    (muscles or glands), in order to initiate a response

While these three types of neurons share common features, their basic
structure may differ slightly according to their function

-   This includes their length, cell body (soma) position and the
    comparative distribution of dendrites and axon terminals

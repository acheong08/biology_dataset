B1 Â Microbiology: Organisms in Industry

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Microorganisms can be used and modified
to perform industrial processes

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Microorganisms are metabolically diverse
-   Microorganisms are used in industry because they are small and have
    a fast growth rate
-   Pathway engineering optimises genetic and regulatory processes
    within microorganisms
-   Pathway engineering is used industrially to produce metabolites of
    interest
-   Fermenters allow large-scale production of metabolites by
    microorganisms
-   Fermentation is carried out by batch or continuous culture
-   Microorganisms in fermenters become limited by their own waste
    products
-   Probes are used to monitor conditions within fermenters
-   Conditions are maintained at optimal levels for the growth of the
    microorganism being cultured

Applications:

-   Deep-tank batch fermentation in the mass production of penicillin
-   Production of citric acid in a continuous fermenter by Aspergillus
    niger and its use as a preservative and flavouring
-   Biogas is produced by bacteria and archaeans from organic matter in
    fermenters

Skills:

-   Gram staining of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
-   Experiments showing zone of inhibition of bacterial growth by
    bactericides in sterile bacterial cultures
-   Production of biogas in a small-scale fermenter

Block Mutations

Block mutations are changes to segments of a chromosome, leading to
large scale changes to the DNA of an organism

-   Block mutations are commonly caused by transposons, which, by
    changing positions within the genome, alter gene sequence

Several types of block mutations exist, including:Â 

-   Duplications â€“ part of chromosome is copied, resulting in
    duplicate sections (potentially increases gene expression)
-   Deletions â€“ a portion of the chromosome is removed (along with any
    genes contained within this segment)
-   Inversions â€“ a segment of a chromosome is removed and then
    replaced within the chromosome in reverse order
-   Translocations â€“ segments of two chromosomes are exchanged (may
    interrupt gene sequences)

Homeostasis

Homeostasis is the tendency for an organism or cell to maintain a
constant internal environment within tolerance limits

Internal equilibrium is maintained by adjusting physiological processes,
including:

-   Body temperature (normally between 36 â€“ 38ÂºC)
-   Carbon dioxide concentration (normally 35 â€“ 45 mmHg)
-   Blood pH (normally between 7.35 â€“ 7.45)
-   Blood glucose levels (normally 75 â€“ 95 mg/dL)
-   Water balance (varies depending on individual body size)

Homeostatic mechanisms operate via a feedback loop that may involve
either the nervous or endocrine systems (or both)

-   When specialised receptors detect an internal change to conditions,
    a response is generated to correct the change
-   Most homeostatic responses involve an effect that is antagonistic to
    the detected stimulus (negative feedback)
-   When levels return to equilibrium, the effector ceases to generate a
    response and an internal balance is therefore maintained
-   If a physiological condition moves outside of tolerance limits,
    disease will occur as a consequence

Geological Time Scale

The Earth formed ~4.6 billion years ago and the earliest forms of life
are thought to have appeared ~3.5 billion years ago

-   To describe the geology and history of life on Earth, scientists
    have developed the geological time scale

The geological time scale measures time on a scale involving four units:

-   An epoch is the smallest unit of time on the scale, but still
    encompasses a period of millions of years
-   Chronologically, epochs are grouped together into larger units
    called periods
-   Periods are combined to make a subdivision called an era
-   An eon is the largest division of geological time

The division of time units in the scale is typically based on the
occurrence of a significant geological event (e.g. mass extinction)

-   Consequently, geological time categories are variable in length and
    do not usually consist of a uniform length of time

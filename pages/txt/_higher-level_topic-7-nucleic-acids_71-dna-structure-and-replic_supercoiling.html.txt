Supercoiling

Supercoiling refers to the additional twisting of a DNA strand and is an
expression of the strain on that strand

-   DNA can be overwound (positive supercoiling) orÂ underwound
    (negative supercoiling) â€“ most DNA is negatively supercoiled

Supercoiling functions to reduce the space required for DNA packaging,
allowing for more efficient storage of DNA

-   DNA will form positive supercoils when unwound byÂ helicase and
    requires an enzyme (DNA gyrase) to reduce the strain
-   In eukaryotic cells, nucleosomes help to supercoil DNAÂ

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural selection can only occur if there is variation among
members of the same species

â€¢ Â Mutation, meiosis and sexual reproduction causes variation between
individuals in a species

Â  Â Â 
Natural selection requires variation among members of a species in order
to differentiate survival (variation needed for selection)

-   This variation can manifest as either discontinous (distinct
    classes) or continuous (range across a characteristic spectrum)

There are three main mechanisms by which genetic variation between
individuals in a species may occur:

-   Mutations â€“ Changing the genetic composition of gametes (germline
    mutation) leads to changed characteristics in offspring
-   Meiosis â€“ Via either crossing over (prophase I) or independent
    assortment (metaphase I)
-   Sexual reproduction â€“ The combination of genetic material from two
    distinct sources creates new gene combinations in offspring

Mutations

AÂ gene mutationÂ is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a section of
DNA coding for a specific trait

-   New alleles are formed by mutation

Gene mutations can be beneficial, detrimental or neutral

-   Beneficial mutations change the gene sequence (missense mutations)
    to create new variations of a trait
-   Detrimental mutations truncate the gene sequence (nonsense
    mutations) to abrogate the normal function of a trait
-   Neutral mutations have no effect on the functioning of the specific
    feature (silent mutations)

Variation via Mutation

Meiosis

Meiosis promotes variation by creating new gene combinations via either
crossing over or independent assortment
1. Â Crossing Over

Crossing over involves the exchange of segments of DNA between
homologous chromosomes during prophase I

-   The exchange of genetic material occurs betweenÂ non-sister
    chromatidsÂ at points calledÂ chiasmata

As a consequence of this recombination, all four chromatids that
comprise the bivalent will be genetically different

-   Chromatids that consist of a combination of DNA derived from both
    homologous chromosomes are calledÂ recombinants
-   Offspring with recombinant chromosomes will have unique gene
    combinations that are not present in either parentÂ

2. Â Independent Assortment

When homologous chromosomes line up in metaphase I, their orientation
towards the opposing poles isÂ random

The orientation of each bivalent occursÂ independently, meaning
different combinations of maternal / paternal chromosomes can be
inherited when bivalents separate in anaphase I

-   The total number of combinations that can occur in gametes is
    2^(n)Â â€“ whereÂ nÂ = haploid number of chromosomes
-   Humans have 46 chromosomes (n = 23) and thus can produce 8,388,608
    different gametes (2²³) by random orientationÂ 
-   If crossing over also occurs, the number of different gamete
    combinations becomesÂ immeasurable

Sexual Reproduction

The fusion of two haploid gametes results in the formation of a diploid
zygote

-   This zygote can then divide by mitosis and differentiate to form a
    developing embryo

As meiosis results in genetically distinct gametes, random fertilisation
by egg and sperm will always generate different zygotes

-   This means that individual offspring will typically show variation
    despite shared parentage
-   Identical twins are formedÂ afterÂ fertilisation, by the complete
    fission of the zygote into two separate cell masses

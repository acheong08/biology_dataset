C3 Â Impacts of Humans on Ecosystems

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Human activities impact
on ecosystem function

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Introduced alien species can escape into local ecosystems and become
    invasive
-   Competitive exclusion and the absence of predators can lead to
    reduction in the numbers of endemic species when alien species
    become invasive
-   Pollutants become concentrated in the tissues of organisms at higher
    trophic levels by biomagnification
-   Macroplastic and microplastic debris has accumulated in marine
    environments

Applications:

-   Study of the introduction of cane toads in Australia and one other
    local example of the introduction of an alien species
-   Discussion of the trade-off between control of the malarial parasite
    and DDT pollution
-   Case study of the impact of marine plastic debris on Laysan
    albatrosses and one other named example

Skills:

-   Analysis of data illustrating the causes and consequences of
    biomagnification
-   Evaluation of eradication programmes and biological control as
    measures to reduce the impact of alien species

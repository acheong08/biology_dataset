Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plants transport organic compounds from sources to sinks

Â  Â Â 
Translocation is the movement of organic compounds (e.g. sugars, amino
acids) from sources to sinks

-   The source is where the organic compounds are synthesised â€“ this
    is the photosynthetic tissues (leaves)
-   The sink is where the compounds are delivered to for use or storage
    â€“ this includes roots, fruits and seeds

Organic compounds are transported from sources to sinks via a vascular
tube system called the phloem

-   Sugars are principally transported as sucrose (disaccharide),
    because it is soluble but metabolically inert
-   The nutrient-rich, viscous fluid of the phloem is called plant sap

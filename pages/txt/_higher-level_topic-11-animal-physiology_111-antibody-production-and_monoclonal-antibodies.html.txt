Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fusion of a tumor cell with an antibody-producing cell creates a
hybridoma cell

â€¢ Â Monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybridoma cells

Â  Â Â 
Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies artificially derived from a single
B cell clone (i.e. identical specific antibodies)

-   An animal (typically a mouse) is injected with an antigen and
    produces antigen-specific plasma cells
-   The plasma cells are removed and fused (hybridised) with tumor cells
    capable of endless divisions (immortal cell line)
-   The resulting hybridoma cell is capable of synthesising large
    quantities of monoclonal antibody

Application:

â€¢ Â Monoclonal antibodies to hCG are used in pregnancy test kits

Â  Â Â 
Monoclonal antibodies can be used for both the therapeutic treatment and
clinical detection of disease

-   An example of therapeutic use involves the use of antibodies in the
    treatment of rabies
-   An example of diagnostic use involves the use of antibodies in the
    detection of pregnancy

Treatment Use

Monoclonal antibodies are commonly used to provide immune protection for
individuals who contract harmful diseases

-   Because the rabies virus can potentially be fatal, injecting
    purified antibodies functions as an effective emergency treatment
-   Monoclonal antibodies can be used to target cancer cells that the
    bodyâ€™s own immune cells fail to recognise as harmful

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are named according to the source
organism from which the antibodies were derived

-   Mice antibodies ('-omabâ€™) are easier to synthesise than human
    antibodies but are less likely to be tolerated by the patient

Examples of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies

Diagnostic Use

Monoclonal antibodies can be used to test for pregnancy via the presence
of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in urine

-   hCG is a hormone produced by women during foetal development and
    thus its presence in urine is indicative of pregnancy

Pregnancy tests use a process called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) to identify a substance via a colour change

-   Free monoclonal antibodies specific to hCG are conjugated to an
    enzyme that changes the colour of a dye
-   A second set of monoclonal antibodies specific to hCG are
    immobilised to the dye substrate
-   If hCG is present in urine, it will interact with both sets of
    monoclonal antibody (forming an antibodyÂ â€˜sandwichâ€™)
-   When both sets of antibody are bound to hCG, the enzyme is brought
    into physicial proximity with the dye, changing its colour
-   A third set of monoclonal antibodies will bind any unattached
    enzyme-linked antibodies, functioning as a control

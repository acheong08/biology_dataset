Understanding:

â€¢ Â Transcription is the synthesis of mRNA copied from the DNA base
sequence by RNA polymerase

Â  Â Â 
Transcription is the process by which an RNA sequence is produced from a
DNA template

-   RNA polymerase separates the DNA strands and synthesises a
    complementary RNA copy from one of the DNA strands
-   When the DNA strands are separated, ribonucleosideÂ triphosphates
    align opposite their exposed complementary base partner
-   RNA polymerase removes the additional phosphate groups and uses the
    energy from this cleavage to covalently join the nucleotide to the
    growing sequence
-   Once the RNA sequence has been synthesised, RNA polymerase detaches
    from the DNA molecule and the double helix reforms

The Role of RNA Polymerase in Transcription

Gene

The sequence of DNA that is transcribed into RNA is called a gene

-   The strand that is transcribed is called the antisense strand and is
    complementary to the RNA sequenceÂ 
-   The strand that is not transcribed is called the sense strand and is
    identical to the RNA sequenceÂ (with T instead of U)

Transcription of genes occur in the nucleus (where DNA is), before the
RNA moves to the cytoplasm (for translation)

Types of RNA

RNA functions to transfer genetic instructions from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, where the information is decoded

There are three types of RNA which cooperate to complete this goal:

-   Messenger RNA (mRNA) â€“ a transcript copy of a gene which encodes a
    specific polypeptide
-   Transfer RNA (tRNA) â€“ carries the polypeptide subunits (amino
    acids) to the organelle responsible for synthesis (ribosome)
-   Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) â€“ a primary component of the ribosome and is
    responsible for its catalytic activity

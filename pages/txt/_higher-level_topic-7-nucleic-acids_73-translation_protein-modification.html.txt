Protein Modification

Post-translational modifications refer to any change in the chemical
composition of proteins following translation

-   These modifications may be vital to the formation of a mature,
    functional protein (e.g. common in cell signalling components)

Addition of new functional groups

-   Enzymes may modify protein structure via the introduction of a new
    chemical group to specific amino acids in the molecule
-   This can include phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation,
    glycosylation, ubiquitination, lipidation, biotination, etc.
-   The addition of chemical groups may alter the properties of the
    chain and induce conformational changes â€“ affecting activity

Proteolytic cleavage of existing elements

-   Proteins may also be modified via the removal of specific amino acid
    segments from a propeptide
-   This occurs in zymogens, where the active site is occluded and
    inactive until proteolytic cleavage occurs
-   The hormone insulin also requires the separation of a middle segment
    to form two polypeptides chains linked by disulfide bridges
-   Another common form of proteolytic cleavage is the removal of the
    initiator methionine residue

Racemization

-   Amino acids can exist as chiral enantiomers ('mirror image'
    stereoisomers)
-   Racemization involves converting proteins from one enantiomeric
    arrangement to a different enantiomeric arrangement
-   Different enantiomers may have distinct chemical properties due to
    the ability to form different intermolecular interactions

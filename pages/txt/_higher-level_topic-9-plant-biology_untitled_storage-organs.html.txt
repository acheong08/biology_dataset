Storage Organs

A storage organ is a part of a plant specifically modified to store
energy (e.g. carbohydrates) or water

-   They are usually found underground (for protection from herbivores)
    and result from changes to roots, leaves or stems

Examples of storage organs include:

-   Bulbs â€“ Modified leaf bases (found as underground vertical shoots)
    that contain layers called scales (e.g. onions)
-   Storage Roots â€“ Modified roots that store water or food in an
    enlarged central stele (e.g. carrots)
-   Tubers â€“ Horizontal underground stems that store carbohydrates
    (e.g. potatoes)

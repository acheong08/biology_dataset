â€¢ Â Events such as strokes may promote reorganisation of brain
function

Â  Â Â 
A stroke is the sudden death of brain cells in a localised area due to
inadequate blood flow

-   This results in the improper functioning of the brain, due to the
    loss of neural connections in the affected area

There are two main types of stroke â€“ ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic
strokes

-   Ischemic strokes result from a clot within the blood restricting
    oxygenation to an associated region of the brain
-   Hemorrhagic strokes result from a ruptured blood vessel causing
    bleeding within a section of the brain

Strokes symptoms may be temporary if the brain is able to reorganise its
neural architecture to restore function

-   Following a stroke, healthy areas of the brain may adopt the
    functionality of damaged regions
-   This capacity for the restoration of normal function is made
    possible due to the neuroplasticity of the brain

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Disturbance influxes the structure and rate of change within
ecosystems

Â  Â Â 
Environmental disturbances may cause fluctuations to the structure and
rate of change within ecosystems

-   Environmental disturbances may be natural or artificial (human
    induced) in origin

Natural Disturbance

A natural environmental disturbance may give rise to secondary
succession â€“ where one ecosystem is replaced by another

-   Secondary succession occurs when succession starts on existing soil
    following the upheaval of a pre-existing ecosystem
-   This upheaval results in the removal of existing biota and allows a
    new ecosystem to develop on the site of the old
-   Because the soil is already developed, dominance is usually achieved
    by the fastest growing plants

The progression of secondary succession can be summarised as follows:

-   An environmental disturbance, such as a bushfire or earthquake,
    destroys the pre-existing climax community
-   Grasses and herbaceous plants are the first to grow back as the soil
    is already present (no pioneer species required)
-   Fast growing trees will develop to their fullest, while shade
    tolerant trees will develop in the understory
-   Eventually the fast-growing trees may be overtaken by larger,
    slower-growing trees as the ecosystem reverts to its prior state

Application:

â€¢ Â Consideration of one example how humans interfere with nutrient
cycling

Â  Â Â 
Deforestation is the permanent destruction of a forest via the removal
or clearance of trees

-   This human-induced degradation of forests is driven primarily by a
    need for timber and cleared land for agricultural purposes

Deforestation disturbs the normal nutrient cycling within the region in
a number of ways:

-   Less trees means there is less evapotranspiration, meaning there is
    less moisture in the air (less precipitation)
-   Fewer trees means less litter (due to less defoliation), which
    reduces the production of humus (so less nutrients in soil)
-   There will be a rapid loss of nutrients from leaching, but less
    chemical weathering of rock (due to less water in soil)
-   The soil will become acidic and release iron and aluminium to form
    an infertile ferrilitic soil (nutrient poor)
-   The soil layer will become increasingly thin and easily eroded once
    the trees have been cleared
-   The infertile soil will prevent vegetative growth, reducing
    biodiversity and further nutrient cycling
-   Logging operations may also alter the distribution of plant species
    by removing the canopy and increasing light exposure
-   Removal of the canopy also results in an increased loss of nutrients
    from the soil via runoff

Skill:

â€¢ Â Investigation into the effect of an environmental disturbance on
an ecosystem

Â  Â Â 
Environmental disturbances are caused by natural or artificial
disruptions to a normal ecosystem, including:

-   Fire breaks inÂ bush lands or regions damaged by bushfires
-   Outer boundaries of population settlements or regions bordering
    roads
-   Dams and artificial rivers and creeks (e.g. irrigation sites)

The effect of an environmental disturbance on an ecosystem can be
measured in a number of ways:

-   Population density (using the Lincoln index via the
    capture-mark-recapture technique)
-   Species diversity and richness (using the Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal
    index)
-   The presence and distribution of indicator species (to measure
    levels of pollution)
-   Canopy coverage and relative light intensity (could measure with a
    lux meter)
-   Biomass (via the average width of tree stems at a specified height)
-   Edaphic factors such as soil erosion (via depth), water retention
    (via drainage), pH and nutrient content

Measurements taken from a disturbed area need to be compared against
measurements taken from an undisturbed control

-   This enables the investigator to statistically calculate both the
    effect and magnitude of the environmental disturbance

Application:

â€¢ Â Control of milk secretion by oxytocin and prolactin

Â  Â Â 
The production and secretion of milk by maternal mammary glands
following birth is called lactation

-   It is predominantly controlled and regulated by two key hormones â€“
    oxytocin and prolactinÂ 

Prolactin is responsible for the development of the mammary glands and
the production of milk

-   It is secreted by the anterior pituitary in response to the release
    of PRH (prolactin releasing hormone) from the hypothalamus
-   The effects of prolactin are inhibited by progesterone, which
    prevents milk production from occurring prior to birth

Oxytocin is responsible for the release of milk from the mammary glands
(milk ejection reflex)

-   It is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by neurosecretory
    cells that extend into the posterior pituitary
-   Oxytocin release is triggered by stimulation of sensory receptors in
    the breast tissue by the suckling infant
-   This creates a positive feedback loop that will result in continuous
    oxytocin secretion until the infant stops feeding

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evidence from cladistics has shown that classification of some
groups based on structure did not correspond

Â  Â  with the evolutionary origins of a group or species

Â  Â Â 
Historically, classification was based primarily on morphological
differences (i.e. structural characteristics)

-   Closely related species were expected to show similar structural
    features, indicating common ancestry

However, there are two key limitations to using morphological
differences as a basis for classification:

-   Closely related organisms can exhibit very different structural
    features due to adaptive radiation (e.g. pentadactyl limb)
-   Distantly related organisms can display very similar structural
    features due to convergent evolution

Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features in
species with distinct lineages

-   It may occur when different species occupy the same habitat and are
    thus subjected to the same selection pressures
-   The shared conditions cause common adaptations to be selected in
    different species, resulting in structural similarity
    -   An example of convergent evolution is the development of wings
        in birds, bats and insects

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Traits can be analogous or homologous

Â  Â Â 
Structural traits are not commonly used to determine clades as such
features may not necessarily indicate shared heritage

-   Traits that are similar because they are derived from common
    ancestry are termed homologous structuresÂ 
-   Traits that are superficially similar but were derived through
    separate evolutionary pathways are termed analogous structures

Using molecular evidence, scientists have discovered that many species
thought to be closely related based on shared structural characteristics
actually demonstrate distinct evolutionary origins

-   Crocodiles have been shown to be more closely related to birds than
    lizards, despite closely resembling lizards in structure
-   Many species of plants previously classified as figworts have been
    reclassified based on molecular evidence

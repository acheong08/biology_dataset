Understanding:

â€¢ Â The exponential growth pattern occurs in an ideal, unlimited
environment

â€¢ Â Population growth slows as the population reaches the carrying
capacity of the environment

Â  Â Â 
Two types of population growth patterns may occur depending on specific
environmental conditions:

-   An exponential growth pattern (J curve) occurs in an ideal,
    unlimited environment
-   A logistic growth pattern (S curve) occurs when environmental
    pressures slow the rate of growth

Exponential Growth

-   Exponential population growth will occur in an ideal environment
    where resources are unlimited
-   In such an environment there will be no competition to place limits
    on a geometric rate of growth
-   Initially population growth will be slow as there is a shortage of
    reproducing individuals that may be widely dispersed
-   As population numbers increase the rate of growth similarly
    increases, resulting in an exponential (J-shaped) curve
-   This maximal growth rate for a given population is known as its
    biotic potential
-   Exponential growth can be seen in populations that are very small or
    in regions that are newly colonised by a species

Logistic Growth

-   Logistic population growth will occur when population numbers begin
    to approach a finite carrying capacity
-   The carrying capacity is the maximum number of a species that can be
    sustainably supported by the environment
-   As a population approaches the carrying capacity, environmental
    resistance occurs, slowing the rate of growth
-   This results in a sigmoidal (S-shaped) growth curve that plateaus at
    the carrying capacity (denoted byÂ Îº)
-   Logistic growth will eventually be seen in any stable population
    occupying a fixed geographic space

Limiting Factors

Limiting factors are environmental conditions that control the rate at
which a process (e.g. population growth) can occur

-   Population growth can be determined by density-dependent or
    density-independent factors

Density dependent environmental factors are influenced by the relative
size of a population

-   These factors include predator numbers, availability of food and
    other resources and the spread of pathogenic diseases

Density independent environmental factors are not influenced by the
relative size of a population

-   These factors include weather and climate conditions, as well as the
    occurrence of natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing simple diagrams of the structure of single nucleotides of
DNA and RNA, using circles, pentagons

Â  Â and rectangles to represent phosphates, pentoses and bases

Â  Â Â 
Nucleic acids are the genetic material of the cell and are composed of
recurring monomeric units called nucleotides

Each nucleotide is comprised of three principal components:

-   5-carbon pentose sugar (pentagon)
-   Phosphate group (circle)
-   Nitrogenous base (rectangle)

Both the phosphate group and nitrogenous base are attached to the
central pentose sugar

-   The nitrogenous base is attached to the 1â€™â€“ carbon atom (right
    point)
-   The phosphate base is attached to the 5â€™â€“ carbon atom (left
    point)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides

Â  Â Â 
There are two types of nucleicÂ acids present in cells â€“ DNA and RNA

-   DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a more stable double stranded form
    that stores the genetic blueprint for cells
-   RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a more versatile single stranded form that
    transfers the genetic information for decoding

Both DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides, however key differences
exist in the composition of DNA and RNA nucleotides

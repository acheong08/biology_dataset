2.8 Â Cell Respiration

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Cell respiration supplies energy
for the functions of life

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Cell respiration is the controlled release of energy from organic
    compounds to produce ATP
-   ATP from cell respiration is immediately available as a source of
    energy in the cell
-   Anaerobic cell respiration gives a small yield of ATP from glucose
-   Aerobic cell respiration requires oxygen and gives a large yield of
    ATP from glucose

Applications:

-   Use of anaerobic cell respiration in yeasts to produce ethanol and
    carbon dioxide in baking
-   Lactate production in humans when anaerobic respiration is used to
    maximise the power of muscle contractions

Skills:

-   Analysis of results from experiments involving measurement of
    respiration rates in germinating seeds or invertebrates using a
    respirometer

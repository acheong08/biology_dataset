Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Diffusion is the net movement of molecules from a region of high
concentration to a region of low concentration

-   This directional movement along a gradient is passive and will
    continue until molecules become evenly dispersed (equilibrium)Â 
-   Small and non-polar (lipophilic) molecules will be able to freely
    diffuse across cell membranes (e.g. O₂, CO₂, glycerol)

The rate of diffusion can be influenced by a number of factors,
including:

-   Temperature Â (affects kinetic energy of particles in solution)
-   Molecular size Â (larger particles are subjected to greater
    resistance within a fluid medium)
-   Steepness of gradient Â (rate of diffusion will be greater with a
    higher concentration gradient)

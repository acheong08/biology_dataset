Summary PDFs

[thumbs up]

Want a (very) condensed summary of each topic that is pretty to look at?

-   Below are links to a series of overviews that cover the SL and HL
    content
-   They are designed as review tools and should not be employed as a
    primary learning resource

Troubleshooting Notes:

-   My computer software is gettingÂ pretty old, so pdf files may look
    slightly funky on certain devices
-   Loading with Internet Explorer or Adobe Acrobat can cause very minor
    issuesÂ 
-   Loading with Safari or Google Chrome seem your best bet for
    maintaining visual fidelity
-   If there are issues printing as a pdf file, just print it as an
    image
-   Spare a thought for the innocent trees before printing them all out!

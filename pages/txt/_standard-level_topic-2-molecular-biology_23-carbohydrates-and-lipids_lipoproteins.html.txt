Lipoproteins

Lipids are insoluble in water and need to formÂ complexes with proteins
(lipoproteins) in order to be transported in the blood

Different classes of lipoprotein carry variable amounts of the different
types of fats (phospholipid, triglycerides, cholesterol)

-   Chylomicrons are produced in the intestine and conduct fats to the
    liver, skeletal muscles and adipose tissue via the lacteals
-   Low density lipoproteins (LDLs) carry fat around the entire body
    within the bloodstream
-   High density lipoproteins (HDLs) collect fat from cells and tissues
    and return it to the liverÂ 
-   Very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and intermediate density
    lipoproteins (IDLs) exist as transitional forms between chylomicrons
    and LDLs

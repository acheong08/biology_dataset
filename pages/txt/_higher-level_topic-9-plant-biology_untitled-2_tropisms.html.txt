Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plant shoots respond to the environment by tropisms

Â  Â Â 
Tropisms describe the growth or turning movement of an plant in response
to a directional external stimulusÂ 

-   Phototropism is a growth movement in response to a unidirectional
    light source
-   Geotropism (or gravitropism) is a growth movement in response to
    gravitational forces
-   Other tropisms include hydrotropism (responding to a water gradient)
    and thigmotropism (responding to a tactile stimulus)

Both phototropism and geotropism are controlled by the distribution of
auxin within the plant cells:

-   In geotropism, auxin will accumulate on the lower side of the plant
    in response to the force of gravity
-   In phototropism, light receptors (phototropins) trigger the
    redistribution of auxin to the dark side of the plant

In shoots, high auxin concentrations promoteÂ cell elongation, meaning
that:

-   The dark side of the shoot elongates and shoots grow towards the
    light (positive phototropism)
-   The lower side of the shoot elongates and roots growÂ away from the
    ground

In roots, high auxin concentrations inhibit cell elongation, meaning
that:

-   The dark side of the root becomes shorter and the roots grow away
    from the light (negative phototropism)
-   The lower side of the root becomes shorter and the roots turn
    downwards into the earth

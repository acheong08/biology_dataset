Application:

â€¢ Â Use of Taq DNA polymerase to produce multiple copies of DNA
rapidly by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Â  Â Â 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an artificial method of
replicating DNA under laboratory conditions

-   The PCR technique is used to amplify large quantities of a specific
    sequence of DNA from an initial minute sample
-   Each reaction doubles the amount of DNA â€“ a standard PCR sequence
    of 30 cycles creates over 1 billion copies (2³⁰)

The reaction occurs in a thermal cycler and uses variations in
temperature to control the replication process via three steps:

1.  Denaturation â€“ DNA sample is heated (~90ÂºC) to separate the two
    strands
2.  Annealing â€“ Sample is cooled (~55ÂºC) to allow primers to anneal
    (primers designate sequence to be copied)
3.  Elongation â€“ Sample is heated to the optimal temperature for a
    heat-tolerant polymerase (Taq) to function (~75ÂºC)

Taq polymerase is an enzyme isolated from the thermophilic bacterium
ThermusÂ aquaticus

-   As this enzymeâ€™s optimal temperature is ~75ÂºC, it is able to
    function at the high temperatures used in PCR without denaturing
-   Taq polymerase extends the nucleotide chain from the primers â€“
    therefore primers are used to select the sequence to be copied

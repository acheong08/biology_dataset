Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA profiling involves comparison of DNA

Â  Â Â 
DNA profiling is a technique by which individuals can be identified and
compared via their respective DNA profiles

-   Within the non-coding regions of an individualâ€™s genome there
    exists satellite DNA â€“ long stretches of DNA made up of repeating
    elements called short tandem repeats (STRs)Â 
-   As individuals will likely have different numbers of repeats at a
    given satellite DNA locus, they will generate unique DNA profilesÂ

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of DNA profiling in paternity and forensic investigations

Â  Â Â 
DNA profiling is commonly used in criminal investigations (forensics)
and to settle paternity disputes

The procedure involved is common for both:

-   A DNA sample is collected (e.g. from blood, semen, saliva, etc.) and
    then amplified using PCR
-   Satellite DNA (with STR sequences) are cut with specific restriction
    enzymes to generate fragments
-   Fragment length will differ between individuals due to the variable
    length of their short tandem repeats
-   The fragments are separated using gel electrophoresis and the
    resulting profiles are compared

Forensic Investigations:

Suspects should be a complete match with the DNA sample taken from the
crime scene if a conviction is to occur

The number of loci used to generate a unique profile depends on the size
of the population being compared

-   E.g. AmericaÂ (population: ~ 320 million) usesÂ 13Â loci for
    comparison; Australia (population: ~ 25 million) uses onlyÂ 9Â loci

Paternity Testing:

Children inherit half their chromosomes from each parent and thus should
possess a combination of parental fragments

-   In other words, all fragments produced in the child should also be
    produced by either the mother or father

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of examples of DNA profiles

Â  Â Â 
Example 1: Â Forensic Investigation

-   Compare the DNA collected from the crime scene to determine which of
    the three suspects was present (click picture to solve)

Example 2: Â Paternal Testing

-   Compare the profiles of three men with that of a mother and child to
    determine the biological father (click picture to solve)

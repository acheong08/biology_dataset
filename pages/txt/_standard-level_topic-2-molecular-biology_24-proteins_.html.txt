2.4 Â Proteins

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Proteins have a very wide range
of functions in living organisms

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Amino acids are linked together by condensation to form polypeptides
-   There are 20 different amino acids in polypeptides synthesised on
    ribosomes
-   Amino acids can be linked together in any sequence giving a huge
    range of possible polypeptides
-   The amino acid sequence of polypeptides is coded for by genes
-   A protein may consist of a single polypeptide or more than one
    polypeptide linked together
-   The amino acid sequence determines the three-dimensional
    conformation of a protein
-   Living organismsÂ synthesise many different proteins with a wide
    range of functions
-   Every individual has a unique proteome

Applications:

-   Rubisco, insulin, immunoglobulins, rhodopsin, collagen and spider
    silk as examples of the range of protein functions
-   Denaturation of proteins by heat or by deviation of pH from the
    optimum

Skills:

-   Drawing molecular diagrams to show the formation of a peptide bond

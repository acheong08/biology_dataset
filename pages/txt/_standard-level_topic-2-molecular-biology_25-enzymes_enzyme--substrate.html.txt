Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes have an active site to which specific substrates bind

Â  Â Â 
An enzyme is a globular protein which acts as a biological catalyst by
speeding up the rate of a chemical reaction

Enzymes are not changed or consumed by the reactions they catalyse and
thus can be reused

Enzymes are typically named after the molecules they react with (called
the substrate) and end with the suffixÂ â€˜-aseâ€™

-   For example, lipids are broken down by the enzyme lipase

Active Site

The active site is the region on the surface of the enzyme which binds
to the substrate molecule

The active site and the substrate complement each other in terms of both
shape and chemical properties

-   Hence only a specific substrate is capable of binding to a
    particular enzymeâ€™s active site

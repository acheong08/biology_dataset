Understanding:

â€¢ Â Prokaryotes have a simple cell structure without
compartmentalisation

Â  Â Â 
Prokaryotes are organisms whose cells lack a nucleus Â ('pro' = before ;
'karyon' = nucleus)

They belong to the kingdom Monera and have been further classified into
two distinct domains:

-   Archaebacteria â€“ found in extreme environments like high
    temperatures, salt concentrations or pH (i.e. extremophiles)
-   Eubacteria â€“ traditional bacteria including most known pathogenic
    forms (e.g. E. coli, S. aureus, etc.)

Prokaryotic Features

Prokaryotic cells will typically contain the following cellular
components:

-   Cytoplasm â€“ internal fluid component of the cell
-   Nucleoid â€“ region of the cytoplasm where the DNA is located (DNA
    strand is circular and called a genophore)
-   Plasmids â€“ autonomous circular DNA molecules that may be
    transferred between bacteria (horizontal gene transfer)Â 
-   Ribosomes â€“ complexes of RNA and protein that are responsible for
    polypeptide synthesis (prokaryote ribosome = 70S)
-   Cell membrane â€“ Semi-permeable and selective barrier surrounding
    the cell
-   Cell wall â€“ rigid outer covering made of peptidoglycan; maintains
    shape and prevents bursting (lysis)
-   Slime capsule â€“ a thick polysaccharide layer used for protection
    against dessication (drying out) and phagocytosis
-   Flagella â€“ Long, slender projections containing a motor protein
    that enables movement (singular: flagellum)
-   Pili â€“ Hair-like extensions that enable adherence to surfaces
    (attachment pili) or mediate bacterial conjugation (sex pili)

Application:

â€¢ Â Prokaryotes divide by binary fission

Â  Â Â 
Binary fission is a form of asexual reproduction used by prokaryotic
cells

In the process of binary fission:

-   The circular DNA is copied in response to a replication signal
-   The two DNA loops attach to the membrane
-   The membrane elongates and pinches off (cytokinesis), forming two
    cells

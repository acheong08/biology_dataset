Understanding:

â€¢ Â Phosphorylation of molecules makes them less stable

Â  Â 
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a high energy molecule that functions as
an immediate power source for cells

-   One molecule of ATP contains three covalently bonded phosphate
    groups â€“ which store potential energy in their bonds
-   Phosphorylation makes molecules less stable and hence ATP is a
    readily reactive molecule that contains high energy bonds
-   When ATP is hydrolysed (to form ADP + Pi), the energy stored in the
    terminal phosphate bond is released for use by the cell

Relationship between ATP and ADP

[ATP-ADP]

ATP has two key functions within the cell:

-   It functions as the energy currency of the cell by releasing energy
    when hydrolysed to ADPÂ (powers cell metabolism)Â 
-   It may transfer the released phosphate group to other organic
    molecules, rendering them less stable and more reactive

ATP is synthesised from ADP using energy derived from one of two
sources:

-   Solar energy â€“ photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical
    energy that is stored as ATP
-   Oxidative processes â€“ cell respiration breaks down organic
    molecules to release chemical energy that is stored as ATP

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cell respiration involves the oxidation and reduction of electron
carriers

Â 
Cell respiration is the controlled release of energy from organic
compounds to produce ATP

-   Anaerobic respiration involves the incomplete breakdown of organic
    molecules for a small yield of ATP (no oxygen required)
-   Aerobic respiration involves the complete breakdown of organic
    molecules for a larger yield of ATP (oxygen is required)

The breakdown of organic molecules occurs via a number of linked
processes that involve a number of discrete steps

-   By staggering the breakdown, the energy requirements are reduced
    (activation energy can be divided across several steps)
-   The released energy is not lost â€“ it is transferred to activated
    carrier molecules via redox reactions (oxidation / reduction)

Redox Reactions

When organic molecules are broken down by cell respiration, the chemical
energy is transferred by means of redox reactions

-   Redox reactions involved the reduction of one chemical species and
    the oxidation of another (redox = reduction / oxidation)

Most redox reactions typically involve the transfer of electrons,
hydrogen or oxygenÂ 

-   Reduction is the gain of electrons / hydrogen or the loss of oxygen
-   Oxidation is the loss of electrons / hydrogen or the gain of oxygen

Redox reactions can be summarised according to the following table:

Redox Mnemonics

Redox reactions involving electrons can be remembered using any of the
following mnemonics:

-   OIL RIG Â â€“ Â Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons) ; Reduction Is Gain
    (of electrons)
-   LEO goes GER Â â€“ Â Loss of Electrons is Oxidation ; Gain of
    Electrons is Reduction
-   ELMO Â â€“ Â Electron Loss Means Oxidation

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Energy released by oxidation reactions is carried to the cristae
of the mitochondria by reduced NAD and FAD

Â Â 
Cell respiration breaks down organic molecules and transfers hydrogen
atoms and electrons to carrier molecules

-   As the organic molecule is losing hydrogen atoms and electrons, this
    is an oxidation reaction
-   Energy stored in the organic molecule is transferred with the
    protons and electrons to the carrier molecules

The carrier molecules are called hydrogen carriers or electron carriers,
as they gain electrons and protons (H⁺ ions)

-   The most common hydrogen carrier is NAD⁺ which is reduced to form
    NADH Â (NAD⁺ + 2H⁺ + 2e^(â€“) Â â†’Â Â NADH + H⁺)
-   A less common hydrogen carrier is FAD which is reduced to form FADH₂
    Â (FADÂ + 2H⁺Â + 2e^(â€“)Â Â â†’Â  FADH₂)

The hydrogen carriers function like taxis, transporting the electrons
(and hydrogen ions) to the cristae of the mitochondria

-   The cristae is the site of the electron transport chain, which uses
    the energy transferred by the carriers to synthesize ATP
-   This process requires oxygen to function, and hence only aerobic
    respiration can generate ATP from hydrogen carriers
-   This is why aerobic respiration unlocks more of the energy stored in
    the organic molecules and produces more ATP

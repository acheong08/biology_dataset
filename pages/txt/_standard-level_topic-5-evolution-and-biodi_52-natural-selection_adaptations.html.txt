Understanding:

â€¢ Â Adaptations are characteristics that make an individual suited to
its environment and way of life

â€¢ Â Individuals that reproduce pass on characteristics to their
offspring

Â  Â Â 
Adaptations are features of organisms that aid their survival by
allowing them to be better suited to their environment

These adaptations may be classified in a number of different ways:

-   Structural: Â Physical differences in biological structure (e.g.
    neck length of a giraffe)
-   Behavioural: Â Differences in patterns of activity (e.g. opossums
    feigning death when threatened)
-   Physiological: Â Variations in detection and response by vital
    organs (e.g. homeothermy, colour perception)
-   Biochemical: Â Differences in molecular composition of cells and
    enzyme functions (e.g. blood groups, lactose tolerance)
-   Developmental: Â Variable changes that occur across the life span of
    an organism (e.g. patterns of ageing / senescence)

Biological adaptations have a genetic basis (i.e. encoded by genes) and
may be passed to offspring when the parents reproduce

-   Organisms with beneficial adaptations will be more likely to survive
    long enough to reproduce and pass on these genes
-   Organisms without these beneficial adaptations will be less likely
    to survive long enough to reproduce and pass on their genes

Hence adaptations result in differential reproduction within a species,
allowing for natural selection to occur

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Bones and exoskeletons provide anchorage for muscles and act as
levers

Â  Â Â 
Movement Systems

The ability to move is controlled by a number of interacting body
systems, including:

-   Skeletal system â€“ consists of bones that act as levers and provide
    a structure for the muscles to pull
-   Muscular system â€“ muscles deliver the force required to move one
    bone in relation to another
-   Nervous system â€“ delivers signals to the muscles which cause them
    to contract and create movement

Body Systems Involved in Locomotion

[musculoskeletal]

Skeletal System

Skeletons are a rigid framework that function to provide support and
protection for body organs

-   Skeletons can be internal (endoskeletons) or external (exoskeletons)
    depending on the organism
-   Endoskeletons typically consist of numerous bones, while
    exoskeletons are comprised of connected segments

Skeletons provide a surface for muscle attachment and thus facilitate
the movement of an organism

-   Bones and exoskeletons act as levers, moving in response to muscular
    contraction
-   Bones are connected to other bones by ligaments, and bones are
    connected to muscles by tendonsÂ

Xylem versus Phloem

Xylem and phloem are both transport vessels that combine to form a
vascular bundle in higher order plants

-   The vascular bundle functions to connect tissues in the roots, stem
    and leaves as well as providing structural support

Xylem

-   Moves materials via the process of transpiration
-   Transports water and minerals from the roots to aerial parts of the
    plant (unidirectional transport)
-   Xylem occupy the inner portion or centre of the vascular bundle and
    is composed of vessel elements and tracheids
-   Vessel wall consists of fused cells that create a continuous tube
    for the unimpeded flow of materials
-   Vessels are composed of dead tissue at maturity, such that vessels
    are hollow with no cell contents

Phloem

-   Moves materials via the process of active translocation
-   Transports food and nutrients to storage organs and growing parts of
    the plant (bidirectional transport)
-   Phloem occupy the outer portion of the vascular bundle and are
    composed of sieve tube elements and companion cells
-   Vessel wall consists of cells that are connected at their transverse
    ends to form porous sieve plates (function as cross walls)
-   Vessels are composed of living tissue, however sieve tube elements
    lack nuclei and have few organelles

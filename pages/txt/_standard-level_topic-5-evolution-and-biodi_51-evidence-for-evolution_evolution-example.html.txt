â€¢ Â Development of melanistic insects in polluted areas

Â  Â Â 
Peppered moths (Biston betularia) exist in two distinct polymorphic
forms â€“ a light colouration and a darker melanic variant

-   In an unpolluted environment, the trees are covered by a
    pale-coloured lichen, which provides camouflage for the lighter moth
-   In a polluted environment, sulphur dioxide kills the lichen while
    soot blackens the bark, providing camouflage for the dark moth

Peppered Moth Variants (Light vs Dark Colouration)

The frequency of the two different forms of peppered moth is dependent
on the environment and evolves as conditions change

-   Before the industrial revolution, the environment was largely
    unpolluted and the lighter moth had a survival advantage
-   Following the industrial revolution, the environment became heavily
    polluted, conferring a survival advantage to the darker moth
-   Recent environmental policies in Europe are reducing pollution
    levels, altering the frequency of the two populations once again

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The skin and mucous membranes form a primary defence against
pathogens that cause infectious disease

Â  Â Â 
The first line of defence against infectious disease are the surface
barriersÂ that prevent the entry of pathogens into the body

-   These surface barriers include both the intact skin and mucous
    membranes

Skin

-   Protects external structures when intact (outer body areas)
-   Consists of a dry, thick and tough region composed predominantly of
    dead surface cells
-   Contains biochemical defence agents (sebaceous glands secrete
    chemicals and enzymes which inhibit microbial growth on skin)
-   The skin also secretes lactic acid and fatty acids to lower the pH
    (skin pH is roughly ~ 5.6 â€“ 6.4 depending on body region)

Mucous Membranes

-   Protects internal structures (i.e. externally accessible cavities
    and tubes â€“ such as the trachea, oesophagus and urethra)
-   Consists of a thin region of living surface cells that release
    fluids to wash away pathogens (mucus, saliva, tears, etc.)
-   Contains biochemical defence agents (secretions contain lysozyme
    which can destroy cell walls and cause cell lysis)
-   Mucous membranes may be ciliated to aid in the removal of pathogens
    (along with physical actions such as coughing / sneezing)

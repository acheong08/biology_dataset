Social Hierarchies

Many organisms form social clusters as their survival prospects are
improved by cooperative group organisation

-   Such social traits are more likely to be passed on to subsequent
    generations and become frequent in the gene pool
-   Types of social organisations include eusociality and dominance
    hierarchies

Eusociality

Eusociality involvesÂ a reproductive division of labour and occurs in
honey bee colonies where a caste system exists

-   A single queen bee (reproductive female) is responsible for the
    production of eggs
-   A few drone bees (reproductive males) are responsible for the
    fertilisation of the eggs
-   The majority of bees are workers (sterile females) and may be
    subdivided into various castes - foragers, soldiers, etc.

Dominance Hierarchies

Baboons live and interact in small groups called troops (10 - 20
members) organised according toÂ physical dominance

-   Troops are structured around dominant females who rank as leaders,
    while males will move in and out of troops
-   Members of the troop do not share food, each individual is
    responsible for themselves (no division of labour)
-   Baboons have no mating season, so females are readily available and
    highly promiscuous (will take many partners)
-   Males will form relationships with females through social activities
    such as grooming, and may help to defend females and infants

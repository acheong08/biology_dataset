Understanding:

â€¢ Â BLAST searches can identify similar sequences in different
organisms

â€¢ Â BLASTn allows nucleotide sequence alignment while BLASTp allows
protein alignment

Â  Â Â 
BLAST searches use an algorithm to compile similar sequences from a
range of different organisms

-   BLAST stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
-   Results are presented in order of relevance â€“ based on the degree
    of match to a search sequence

BLAST searches can be used to compare either nucleic acid or protein
sequences:

-   BLASTn compares nucleotide sequences to allow for DNA or RNA
    alignments
-   BLASTp compares amino acid sequences to allow for protein alignment

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Sequence alignment software allows comparison of sequences from
different organisms

Â  Â Â 
Certain software programs can display multiple sequences together to
show the degree of similarity between them

-   This is called a sequence alignment and is commonly used to show the
    degree of relatedness between sequences
-   Protein sequences usually show more similarities than nucleotide
    sequences because of the degeneracy of the genetic code
    -   I.e. Some codons code for the same amino acid, so different
        nucleotide sequences can code the same protein sequence

Multiple Alignment of a Protein Sequence from Various Species

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of software to align two proteins

Â  Â Â 
Clustal Omega is a free online tool that will align nuclotide or amino
acid sequences for comparison

-   It can compare multiple (more than two) sequences at once
-   Sequence consensus can be colour coded in a Jalview applet found
    underÂ â€˜Result Summaryâ€™ (requires Java)

To construct a multiple alignment:

-   Change the input sequence type to the relevant form (DNA, RNA or
    protein)
-   Paste the relevant sequences into the provided space
-   Before each sequence designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)
-   Alternatively, sequences can be saved as a document in plain text
    format (.txt) and then uploaded
-   When all sequences have been included, clickÂ â€˜Submitâ€™Â (under
    step 3)

Below are plain text files that contain nucleotide and amino acid
sequences for multiple alignment:

-   CHRNEÂ Â â€“ Â Cholinergic receptor epsilon (nicotinic) for various
    species (nucleotide sequence)
-   HBAÂ Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin alpha chain from various speciesÂ (amino
    acid sequence)

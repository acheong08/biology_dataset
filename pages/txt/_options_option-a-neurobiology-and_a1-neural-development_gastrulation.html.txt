Gastrulation

Gastrulation is an early phase of embryogenesis whereby a single-layered
blastula differentiates into three germ layers

-   The organisation of cell layers occurs by different mechanisms in
    different types of animals
-   The end result in all cases is a trilaminar (three layered) mass of
    cells called a gastrula
-   Gastrulation precedes further cellular differentiation by processes
    such as neurulation

Germ Layers

Gastrulation results in the production of three germ layers â€“ ectoderm
(outer), mesoderm (middle) and endoderm (inner)

-   The ectoderm will form the nervous system (via neurulation) and
    outer surfaces such as skin, pigment cells and hair cells
-   The mesoderm will form the majority of body organs, including
    muscle, blood vessels, kidney, heart and skeleton
-   The endoderm will form the respiratory and digestive tracts, as well
    as associated organs such as the liver and pancreas

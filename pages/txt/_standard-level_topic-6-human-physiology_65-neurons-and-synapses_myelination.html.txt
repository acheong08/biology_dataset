Understanding:

â€¢ Â The myelination of nerve fibres allows for saltatory conduction

Â  Â Â 
In certain neurons, the axon may be covered by a fatty white substance
called myelin which functions as an insulating layer

-   Myelin is a mixture of protein and phospholipids that is produced by
    glial cells (Schwann cells in PNS; oligodendrocytes in CNS)

The main purpose of the myelin sheath is to increase the speed of
electrical transmissions via saltatory conduction

-   Along unmyelinatedÂ neurons, action potentials propagate
    sequentially along the axon in a continuous wave of depolarisation
-   In myelinated neurons, the action potentialsÂ â€˜hop' between the
    gaps inÂ the myelin sheath called the nodes of Ranvier
-   This results in an increase in the speed of electrical conduction by
    a factor of up to 100-fold

Myelination

Not all neurons within the nervous system are insulated with a myelin
sheath

-   The advantage of myelination is that it improves the speed of
    electrical transmission via saltatory conduction
-   The disadvantage of myelination is that it takes up significant
    space within an enclosed environment

Regions of the nervous system composed of myelinated axon tracts appear
as white matter, all other areas appear as grey matter

-   Grey matter consists of neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, as well
    as support cells (glial cells) and synapsesÂ

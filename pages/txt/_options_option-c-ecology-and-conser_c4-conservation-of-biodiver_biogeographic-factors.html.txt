Understanding:

â€¢ Â Biogeographic factors affect species diversity

Â  Â Â 
Biodiversity within a given ecosystem will be affected by a number of
biogeographic factors:

-   Larger habitats tend to promote biodiversity better than smaller
    habitats (more available niches = less competition)
-   Ecology at the edges of ecosystems is different from central areas
    (e.g. more sunlight, more wind, etc.)
-   This is known as the edge effect, whereby species distribution is
    influenced by the divergent environmental conditions
-   Edges tend to have greater biodiversity, as different habitats with
    different abiotic factors exist in close physical proximity
-   However edges tend to have more competition than central regions,
    which may restrict survival prospects of certain species
-   Habitat corridors between parts of a fragmented habitat can connect
    disparate regions to improve genetic diversity

These principles are routinely applied when setting aside land as a
nature reserve to improve the conservation of biodiversity

Application:

â€¢ Â Analysis of the impact of biogeographic factors on diversity
limited to island size and edge effect

Â  Â Â 
Island Size

The biodiversity of an island is typically proportionate to island size
(i.e. larger islands have greater biodiversity)

-   Larger islands support a greater range of habitats (and hence more
    available niches for species to occupy)
-   Larger islands can sustain higher population numbers for each
    species (increases species evenness)
-   Larger islands have greater productivity at each trophic level,
    leading to longer and more stable food chains

Edge Effect

The diversity of species within a given environment changes with
proximity to the ecosystemâ€™s boundaries (edge effect)

-   Biodiversity may be greater at the border between two ecosystems as
    different abiotic factors favour certain species
-   However certain species may not be able to thrive under these
    conditions and instead must occupy more central regions
-   The effect of edges on biodiversity will be greatly influenced by
    the particular conditions caused by the ecological disturbance

Kidney Dialysis

It is possible to mimic the selective absorption of materials by the
bilayer using artificially synthesised porous membranes

Kidney dialysis involves the external filtering of blood in order to
remove metabolic wastes in patients with kidney failureÂ 

Blood is removed and pumped through a dialyzer, which has two key
functions that are common to biological membranes:

-   It contains a porous membrane that is semi-permeable (restricts
    passage of certain materials)
-   It introduces fresh dialysis fluid and removes wastes to maintain an
    appropriate concentration gradient

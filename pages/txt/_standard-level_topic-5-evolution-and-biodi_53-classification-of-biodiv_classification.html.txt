Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural classifications help in identification of species and
allow the prediction of characteristics shared byÂ 

Â  Â  species within a group

Â  Â Â 
Historically, there have been two main classification schemes used to
identify living organisms â€“ artificial and natural classification

-   Both use prominent features as the basis for classification, however
    differ in the way these characteristics are established

Artificial classification involves arbitrarily selecting unifying
characteristics first and then grouping organisms accordingly

-   The advantage of artificial classification is that such schemes are
    easy to develop and relatively stable (unlikely to change)
-   The disadvantage is that they do not generally show evolutionary
    relationships and for this reason are not commonly used
    -   For example, if organisms were classified according to the
        presence of fins then whales would be grouped with fish
    -   If organisms were classified based on the presence of shells
        then snails would be grouped with turtles and not with squid

Natural classification involves grouping organisms based on similarities
first and then identifying shared characteristics

-   According to a natural classification system, all members of a
    particular group would have shared a common ancestor
-   This means that natural classification schemes can be used to
    predict characteristics shared by species within a group
-   A disadvantage of such schemes is that they are highly mutable and
    tend to change as new information is discovered

A third type of classification â€“ phylogenetic classification â€“ is
now being used to differentiate organisms based on genetics

-   Organisms who share a greater level of homology in their DNA or
    amino acid sequences are expected to be more closely related

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In a natural classification, the genus and accompanying higher
taxa consist of all the species that have evolvedÂ 

Â  Â  from one common ancestral species

Â  Â Â 
An advantage of natural classification is that it identifies traits
based on groupings, rather than assigning groups based on traits

-   This means that it can be used to show evolutionary relationships
    and predict characteristics shared by species within a group

According to natural classification, each taxonomic level includes all
species that would have evolved from a common ancestor

-   Species of the same genus would have a common genus ancestor and be
    more closely related than species of the same order
-   Hence, organisms that share a lower taxa must share all higher taxa
    (e.g. if the same order then must also be the same class)

Identifying Evolutionary Relationships Using Natural Classification

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Taxonomists sometimes reclassify groups of species when new
evidence shows that a previous taxon contains

Â  Â  species that have evolved from different ancestral species

Â  Â Â 
A disadvantage of natural classifications is that because they predict
evolutionary relationships, they change with new information

-   Taxonomists will reclassify groups of species when new evidence
    arises to compromise the traditional classification scheme

Groups of species may be separated into different genera if new evidence
suggests they evolved from different ancestral species

-   Species originally classified as figworts have been reclassified
    into different genera based on DNA sequence comparisons

Alternatively, different species may be grouped into a sharedÂ taxon if
new evidence suggests more recent common ancestryÂ 

-   TheÂ Homininae sub-family was created to include gorillas and
    chimpanzees when it was deduced that they share more common ancestry
    with humans than with other great apes (e.g.Â orang-utan)

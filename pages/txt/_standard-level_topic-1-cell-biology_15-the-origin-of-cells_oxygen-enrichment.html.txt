Oxygen Enrichment

Primordial Earth had a reducing atmosphere that contained very low
levels of oxygen gas

After about ~2 billion years of prokaryotic life, a form of chlorophyll
evolved in prokaryotes (forming cyanobacteria)

This allowed for the process of photosynthesis to occur, creating oxygen
gas as a by-product via the photolysis of water

The increase in oxygen in the atmosphere was coupled to a number of
significant effects:

-   There was a breakdown of chemicals in the atmosphere and oceans to
    produce oxidised compounds (e.g. COâ‚‚)
-   There was an evolution of organisms capable of breaking down
    oxygen-rich oxidising agents (e.g. aerobes)
-   The subsequent formation of an ozone layer restricted UV radiation
    to allow for the proliferation of a wider range of life forms

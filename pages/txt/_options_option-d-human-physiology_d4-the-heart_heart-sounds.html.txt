Understanding:

â€¢ Â Normal heart sounds are caused by the AV valves and semilunar
valves closing causing changes in blood flow

Â  Â Â 
The heart contains a number of heart valves which prevent the backflow
of blood

-   This ensures the one-way circulation of blood around the body

There are two sets of valves located within the heart:

-   Atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and bicuspid) prevent blood in
    the ventricles from flowing back into the atria
-   Semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic) prevent blood in the
    arteries from flowing back into the ventricles

Heart sounds are made when these two sets of valves close in response to
pressure changes within the heart

-   The first heart sound is caused by the closure of the
    atrioventricular valves at the start of ventricular systole
-   The second heart sound is caused by the closure of the semilunar
    valves at the start of ventricular diastole

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The cerebral hemispheres are responsible for higher order
functions

Â  Â Â 
The cerebrum is organised into two hemispheres that are responsible for
higher order functions and complex skills

-   These functions include memory, speech, cognitive thought, problem
    solving, attention and emotions

Not all complex tasks are equally represented by both cerebral
hemispheres â€“ some activities are localised to a single side

-   Speech production is coordinated by Brocaâ€™s area, which is
    situated in the left frontal lobe of the brain

Information can be passed between the two hemispheres by a bundle of
myelinated nerve fibres embedded within the brain

-   These fibres form the corpusÂ callosum to facilitate
    interhemispheric communication

Lateralization of Brain Function

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The left cerebral hemisphere receives sensory inputs from sensory
receptors in the right side of the body

Â  Â Â and the right side of the visual field in both eyes and vice
versa for the right hemisphere

Â  Â Â 
The left cerebral hemisphere is responsible for processing sensory
information from the right side of the body (and vice versa)

-   Tactile sensation from the left side of the body is processed by the
    right side of the brain (at the somatosensory cortex)
-   Objects on the left side of the visual field in both eyes are
    processed on the right side of the visual cortex

The processing of information on the opposite side of the body is called
contralateral processing (same side = ipsilateral)

-   Tactile information from the left side of the body is transferred to
    the right side in the spinal cord or brainstem
-   Visual information from the left visual field is transferred to the
    right cerebral hemisphere at the optic chiasma

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The left cerebral hemisphere controls muscle contraction in the
right side of the body and vice versa for theÂ 

Â  Â Â right hemisphere

Â  Â Â 
The left cerebral hemisphere is also responsible for processing motor
information for the right side of the body (and viceÂ versa)

-   Muscular contractions are coordinated by the motor cortex (premotor
    cortex = preparation ; primary motor cortex = execution)

A consequence of this contralateral processing is that damage to one
side of the brain affects the other side of the body

-   For instance, a stroke in the left hemisphere may cause paralysis to
    the right side of the body

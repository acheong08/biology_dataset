Earth Spheres

The Earth is made up of four distinct yet connected spheres â€“
lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere

-   The lithosphere (or geosphere) describes all the rocks, minerals and
    molten magma found on or in the Earth
-   The hydrosphere describes all the water on Earth â€“ including
    liquid water (oceans, etc.) and vapour (precipitation)
-   The atmosphere describes the layer of gases surrounding the Earth
    and is divided into sections (stratosphere, etc.)
-   The biosphere is composed of all the living organisms on the planet
    (including plants, animals, bacteria, etc.)

The four spheres are interconnected, so human impact on one sphere will
potentially effect other spheres

-   The release of plastic pollution into the oceans (hydrosphere) will
    impact on marine life (biosphere)
-   The production and release of CFCs into the atmosphere will effect
    the impact of UV radiation on the biosphere

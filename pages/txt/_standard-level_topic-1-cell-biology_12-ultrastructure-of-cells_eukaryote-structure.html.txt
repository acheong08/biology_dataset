[animaldraw1]

Key Features:

-   Nucleus â€“ shown as double membrane structure with pores
-   Mitochondria â€“ double membrane with inner one folded into cristae
    ; no larger than half the nucleus in size
-   Golgi apparatus â€“ shown as a series of enclosed sacs (cisternae)
    with vesicles leading to and from
-   Endoplasmic reticulum â€“ interconnected membranes shown as bare
    (smooth ER) and studded (rough ER)
-   Ribosomes â€“ labelled as 80S
-   Cytosol â€“ internal fluid labelled as cytosol (â€˜cytoplasm' is all
    internal contents minus the nucleus)

Key Features:

-   Vacuole â€“ large and occupying majority of central space
    (surrounded by tonoplast)
-   Chloroplasts â€“ double membrane with internal stacks of membrane
    discs (only present in photosynthetic tissue)
-   Cell wall â€“ labelled as being composed of cellulose ; thicker than
    cell membrane
-   Shape â€“ brick-like shape with rounded corners

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Receptors detect changes in the environment

Â  Â Â 
Sensitivity describes the ability of an organism to detect external and
internal changes and respond accordingly

-   ReceptorsÂ detect these changes as stimuli, and generate nerve
    impulses which are relayed to the brain and effector organs
-   There are different types of receptors that each recognise a
    different type of stimulus (temperature, light, etc.)

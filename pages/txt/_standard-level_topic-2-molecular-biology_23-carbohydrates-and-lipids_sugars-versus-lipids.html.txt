Application:

â€¢ Â Lipids are more suitable for long-term energy storage in humans
than carbohydrates

Â  Â Â 
Lipids and carbohydrates both function as energy storage molecules in
humans, however differ in several key aspects:

-   Storage (lipids are more suitable for long-term energy storage)
-   Osmolality (lipids have less of an effect on the osmotic pressure of
    a cell)
-   Digestion (carbohydrates are easier to digest and utilise)
-   ATP Yield (lipids store more energy per gram)
-   Solubility (carbohydrates are easier to transport in the
    bloodstream)
    Mnemonic:Â  SODAS

Energy Storage Analogy

ATP is the energy currency of the cell â€“ in this respect it is akin to
cash

-   Cash is earned when you work (cell respiration) and can be spent in
    a number of ways (metabolism)

Storing energy as carbohydrates (i.e. glycogen) is similar to keeping
the cash in a wallet

-   It is easier to carry around (monosaccharides and disaccharides are
    water soluble)
-   It is readily accessible (carbohydrates are easier to digest)
-   You cannot carry as much (carbohydrates store less energy per gram)

Storing energy as lipids (i.e. triglycerides) is similar to keeping the
cash in a safe

-   It is not viable to carry around (triglycerides are insoluble in
    water)
-   It is harder to access (triglycerides cannot be easily digested)
-   You can keep more cash in it (triglycerides store more energy per
    gram)

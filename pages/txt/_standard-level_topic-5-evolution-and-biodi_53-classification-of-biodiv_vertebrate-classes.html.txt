Â  Â Â 
Chordates are animals that possess certain key features in an embryonic
state that may persist into adulthoodÂ 

-   These features include a notochord, hollow dorsal neural tube,
    pharyngeal slits and a post-anal tail

In some chordates, the neural tube will develop into a spine and the
notochord will form a protective backbone

-   These chordates are grouped into a sub-phylum (vertebrata) and
    include birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles and fish

[fish icon]

Fish

-   Covered in scales made out of bony plates in the skin
-   Reproduce via external fertilisation (egg and sperm released into
    the environment)
-   Breathe through gills that are covered with an operculum
-   Does not maintain a constant internal body temperature (ectothermic)

[amphibian icon]

Amphibian

-   Moist skin, permeable to gases and water
-   Reproduce via external fertilisation (usually spend larval state in
    water, adult state on land)
-   Can breathe through skin but also possess simple lungs
-   Do not maintain a constant internal body temperature (ectothermic)

[reptile icon]

Reptiles

-   Covered in scales made out of keratin
-   Reproduce via internal fertilisation and females lay eggs with soft
    shells
-   Breathe through lungs that have extensive folding (increases SA:Vol
    ratio)
-   Do not maintain a constant internal body temperature (ectothermic)

[bird icon]

Birds

-   Covered in feathers (made out of keratin)
-   Reproduce via internal fertilisation and females lay eggs with hard
    shells
-   Breathe through lungs with parabronchial tubes
-   Maintain a constant internal body temperature (endothermic)

[mammal icon]

Mammals

-   Skin has follicles which produce hair made out of keratin
-   Reproduce via internal fertilisation and females feed young with
    milk from mammary glands
-   Breathe through lungs with alveoli
-   Maintain a constant internal body temperature (endothermic)

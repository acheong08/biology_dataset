Lines of Defense

The immune system can be divided into three basic lines of defense
against pathogenic infection:

-   The first line of defense against infection are the surface barriers
    that prevent the entry of pathogens into the body
-   The second line of defense are the non-specific phagocytes and other
    internal mechanisms that comprise innate immunity
-   The third line of defense are the specific lymphocytes that produce
    antibodies as part of the adaptive immune response

The Immune System: Three Lines of Defense

[lines of defence]

First Line of Defense

-   The primary defence against infectious disease are the surface
    barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body
-   These surface barriers include intact skin (protect external
    boundaries) and mucous membranes (protect internal boundaries)
-   Both the skin and mucous membranes release chemical secretions which
    restrict the growth of microbes on their surfaces
-   If pathogens cannot enter the host body, they cannot disrupt normal
    physiological functions and cause disease

Second Line of Defense

-   The second line of defence against infection are the non-specific
    cellular and molecular responses of the innate immune system
-   These defences do not differentiate between different types of
    pathogen and respond the same way upon every infection
-   Phagocytic leukocytes migrate to infection sites and engulf foreign
    bodies (dendritic cells then present antigens to lymphocytes)
-   Inflammatory responses increase capillary permeability at infected
    sites, recruiting leukocytes but leading to localised swelling
-   Antimicrobial proteins (such as cytokines and complement proteins)
    regulate immune activity within the body
-   Fever increases body temperatures to activate heat-shock proteins
    and suppress microbial growth and propagation

Third Line of Defense

-   The final line of defence against infection are the lymphocytes that
    produce antibodies to specific antigenic fragments
-   Each B cell produces a specific antibody, and the body has millions
    of different B cells capable ofÂ detecting distinct antigens
-   Helper T cells regulate B cell activation, ensuring that antibodies
    are only mass-produced at the appropriate times
-   Both B and T cells will differentiate to form memory cells after
    activation, conferring long-term immunity to a particular pathogen

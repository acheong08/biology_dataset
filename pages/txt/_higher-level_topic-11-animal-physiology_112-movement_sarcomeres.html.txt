Understanding:

â€¢ Â Each myofibril is made up of contractile sarcomeres

Â  Â Â 
Myofibrils consist of repeating contractile units called sarcomeres,
which are made of two protein myofilaments

-   The thick filament (myosin) contains small protruding heads which
    bind to regions of the thin filament (actin)
-   Movement of these two filaments relative to one another causes the
    lengthening and shortening of the sarcomere

Each individual sarcomere is flanked by dense protein discs called Z
lines, which hold the myofilaments in place

-   The actin filaments radiate out from the Z discs and help to anchor
    the central myosin filaments in place

The recurring sarcomeres produce a striated (striped) pattern along the
length of the skeletal muscle fibres

-   The centre of the sarcomere appears darker due to the overlap of
    both actin and myosin filaments (A band)
-   The peripheries of the sarcomere appear lighter as only actin is
    present in this region (I band)
-   The dark A band may also contain a slightly lighter central region
    where only the myosin is present (H zone)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing labelled diagrams of the structure of a sarcomere

Â  Â Â 
When drawing a diagram of a sarcomere it is important to remember the
following conventions:

-   The myosin filaments are the thick filaments and should be
    represented as being thicker than the actin filaments
-   The myosin filaments should include protruding heads (myosin heads
    form cross-bridge attachments with actin)
-   The striated banding pattern should be identified (A band = dark
    region ; I band = light region)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Vaccines contain antigens that trigger immunity but do not cause
the disease

Â  Â Â 
Vaccinations induce long-term immunity to specific pathogenic infections
by stimulating the production of memory cells

-   A vaccine is a weakened or attenuated form of the pathogen that
    contains antigens but is incapable of triggering disease
-   The antigenic determinants in a vaccine may be conjugated to an
    adjuvant, which functions to boost the immune response
-   The body responds to an injected vaccine by initiating a primary
    immune response, which results in memory cells being made
-   When exposed to the actual pathogen, the memory cells trigger a more
    potent secondary immune response
-   As a consequence of this more potent immune response, disease
    symptoms do not develop (individual is immune to pathogen)

The length of time a person is immune to infection following a
vaccination depends on how long the memory cells survive for

-   Memory cells may not survive a lifetime and individuals may
    subsequently require a booster shot to maintain immunity

Herd Immunity

Vaccinations programmes are implemented to reduce the outbreak of
particular infectious diseases within populations

-   An epidemic is a substantially increased occurrence of a particular
    infection within a given region
-   A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread across a
    largeÂ geographical area (like a continent)

Vaccination confers immunity to vaccinated individuals but also
indirectly protects non-vaccinated individuals via herd immunity

-   Herd immunity is when individuals who are not immune to a pathogen
    are protected from exposure by the large amounts of immune
    individuals within the community

Application:

â€¢ Â Smallpox was the first infectious disease of humans to have been
eradicated by vaccination

Â  Â Â 
Smallpox was the first infectious disease of humans to have been
eradicated via vaccination

-   When a disease stops circulating in a region it is considered
    eliminated â€“ if it is eliminated worldwide, it is considered
    eradicated

Smallpox was targeted for eradication in 1967 by the World Health
Organisation (WHO), via a global vaccination programme

-   The last known case of smallpox in a civilian was registered in 1977
    and it was officially declared eradicated by WHO in 1980

The eradication of smallpox by vaccination was successful for a number
of reasons:

-   Smallpox was easily identifiable due to overt clinical symptoms,
    which helped to limit potential transmission
-   Transmission only occurred via direct contact and there were no
    animal vectors or reservoirs to sustain the infectious agent
-   The infection period was short lived (3 â€“ 4 weeks) and the virus
    was stable andÂ didnâ€™t mutate into alternate strains
-   There was global cooperation and immunity was long-term so repeated
    booster shots were unnecessary

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of epidemiological data related to vaccination programmes

Â  Â Â 
Vaccination programmes have lead to a reduction in the incidence of
infectious diseases in a number of regions

-   Different nations will implement different vaccination practices
    depending on the regional pathogenic threats

The World Health Organisation keeps a record of disease incidence and
immunisation schedules in different countries

-   These records are updated yearly and can be accessed at the
    following website: Â WHO Data and Statistics

Epidemiology is the study of the patterns, causes and effects of health
and disease conditions in a defined population

-   It can be used to compare the incidence of a disease over time
    (prior and following vaccination programme implementation)
-   It can be used to compare the incidence of a disease in different
    regions (both with and without vaccination programmes)

Vaccination Data

The following resources can be used to generate data tables and graphs
relating to national vaccination programmes:

-   Reported Disease Incidence Time Series Â (Excel file)
-   Year of Introduction of Selected Vaccine Â (Excel file)

When analysing trends associated with this data it is important to
remember the following caveats:

-   Populations have increased year on year, which would be likely to
    increase the risk of potential outbreaks
-   Improvements to health care services, public sanitation and medical
    breakthroughs will also influence disease rates
-   Different regions may experience different levels of exposure to
    particular infections (due to climate and vector presence)

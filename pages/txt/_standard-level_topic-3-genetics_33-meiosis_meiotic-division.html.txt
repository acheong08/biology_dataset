Understandings:

â€¢ Â One diploid nucleus divides by meiosis to produce four haploid
nuclei

â€¢ Â Separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic
division halve the chromosome number

Â  Â Â 
Meiosis is the process by which sex cells (gametes) are made in the
reproductive organs

-   It involves the reduction division of a diploidÂ germline cell into
    four genetically distinct haploid nuclei

The process of meiosis consists of two cellular divisions:

-   The first meiotic division separates pairs of homologous chromosomes
    to halve the chromosome number (diploidÂ â†’Â haploid)
-   The second meiotic division separates sister chromatids (created by
    the replication of DNA during interphase)

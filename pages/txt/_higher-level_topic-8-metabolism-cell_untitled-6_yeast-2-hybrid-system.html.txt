Yeast-2-Hybrid System

The yeast-2-hybrid system is a simple scientific technique used to
screen a library of proteins for potential interactions

-   Firstly, a transcription factor is broken into two parts â€“ a
    DNA-binding domain (BD) and a catalytic activation domain (AD)
-   The DNA-binding domain is fused to a protein of interest called the
    bait (e.g. an enzyme)
-   The activation domain is fused to a number of potential binding
    partners â€“ called the prey (e.g. different ligands)
-   If the bait and prey interact, the two parts of the transcription
    factor are reconstituted and activate transcription of a gene
-   If the bait and prey do not interact, the two parts of the
    transcription factor remain separate and transcription doesnâ€™t
    occur

The yeast-2-hybrid system detects protein-protein interactions according
to the activation of a reporter gene

-   The reporter gene may encode for the production of a protein that
    causes a visible colour change (e.g. ÃŸ-galactosidase)
-   Alternatively, the reporter gene may encode for the production of an
    essential amino acid that is required for the yeast to grow on a
    deficient media (hence yeast growth would indicate successful
    interaction between bait and prey)

Yeast-2-hybrid screens are a simple technique and hence have a
relatively high rate of false positives (partial interactions)

-   Consequently, the yeast-2-hybrid system is typically only used as an
    initial test to identify possible protein interactionsÂ

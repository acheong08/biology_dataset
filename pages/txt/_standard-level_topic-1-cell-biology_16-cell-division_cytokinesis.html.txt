Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cytokinesis occurs after mitosis and is different in plant and
animal cells

Â  Â Â 
Cytokinesis is the process of cytoplasmic division, whereby the cell
splits into two identical daughter cells

Cytokinesis occurs concurrently with the final stage of mitosis
(telophase) and is different in plant and animal cells

Animal Cells

-   After anaphase, microtubule filaments form a concentric ring around
    the centre of the cell
-   The microfilaments constrict to form a cleavage furrow, which
    deepens from the periphery towards the centre
-   When the furrow meets in the centre, the cell becomes completely
    pinched off and two cells are formed
-   Because this separation occurs from the outside and moves towards
    the centre, it is described as centripetal

Plant Cells

-   After anaphase, carbohydrate-rich vesicles form in a row at the
    centre of the cell (equatorial plane)
-   The vesicles fuse together and an early cell plate begins to form
    within the middle of the cell
-   The cell plate extends outwards and fuses with the cell wall,
    dividing the cell into two distinct daughter cells
-   Because this separation originates in the centre and moves
    laterally, it is described as centrifugal

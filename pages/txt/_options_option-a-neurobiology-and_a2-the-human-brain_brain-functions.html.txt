Application:

â€¢ Â Use of animal experiments, autopsy, lesions and fMRI to identify
the role of different brain parts

Â  Â Â 
The role of a specific brain part can be identified by either
stimulating or removing the region to assess its effect

-   Identification of brain roles can be made via the use of animal
    experiments, autopsy, lesions and fMRI

Animal Experiments

-   AnimalÂ experimentation can be used to identify function by
    stimulating regions with electrodes or removing via lobotomy
-   Because such methods are highly invasive and potentially damaging,
    animal models are frequently used
-   Experimentation on animals involves less ethical restrictions than
    human studies (although ethical standards do exist)
-   Animal studies are limited by the differences between animal and
    human brains, making valid comparisons difficult
-   Example: Â Animal studies using mice and rats have been used to
    develop drug treatments for diseases such as MS

Lesions

-   Lesions are abnormal areas of brain tissue which can indicate the
    effect of the loss of a brain area
-   Lesions can be identified via post-mortem analysis (autopsy) or via
    scans of the brain (CT scans or MRI)
-   The effects of lesions can be difficult to identify, as many
    functions may involve multiple brain areas
-   Additionally, the brain has the capacity to re-learn certain skills
    by re-routing instructions to other areas (plasticity)
-   Example: Â Split brain patients have been used to identify specific
    roles of the left and right cerebral hemisphere

Autopsy

-   An autopsy is a post-mortem examination of a corpse via dissection
    in order to evaluate causes of death
-   Comparisons can be made between the brains of healthy and diseased
    corpses to identify affected brain areas
-   Example: Â Cadavers who suffered from aphasia (language impairment)
    in life demonstrate damage to specific areas

fMRI

-   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) records changes in
    blood flow within the brain to identify activated areas
-   Oxygenated haemoglobin responds differently to a magnetic field than
    deoxygenated haemoglobin
-   These differences in oxygenation can be represented visually and
    reflect differences in the level of brain activity
-   fMRI is non-invasive and can be used to identify multiple brain
    regions involved in complex, integrated brain activities
-   Example: Â fMRI studies have been used to diagnose ADHD and
    dyslexia, as well as monitor recovery from strokes

Methods for Identifying Brain Functions

Application:

â€¢ Â Visual cortex, Brocaâ€™s area, nucleusÂ accumbens as areas of the
brain with specific functions

Â  Â Â 
While complex activities may require integration of multiple regions,
some specific functions are localised to particular areas

-   Examples of brain areas with clearly defined functions include the
    visual cortex, Brocaâ€™s area and the nucleusÂ accumbens

Visual Cortex

-   Located within the occipital lobe of the cerebrum and receives
    neural impulses from light-sensitive cells in the eyes
-   The visual cortex is the region of the brain responsible for visual
    perception (sight)Â 

Brocaâ€™s Area

-   Located within the frontal lobe of the left cerebral hemisphere (not
    present in the right hemisphere)
-   Is responsible for speech production (if damaged, the
    individualÂ cannot produce meaningful speech despite intending to)

Nucleus Accumbens

-   The nucleus accumbens is involved in the pleasure reward pathway and
    is found within each cerebral hemisphere
-   It secretes neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of pleasure
    (dopamine) and satiety (serotonin)
-   It communicates with other centres involved in the mechanisms of
    pleasure, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA)

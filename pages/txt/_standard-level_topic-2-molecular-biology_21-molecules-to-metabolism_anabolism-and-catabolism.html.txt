Understanding:

â€¢ Â Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler
molecules including the formation ofÂ 

Â  Â macromolecules from monomers by condensation reactions

Â  Â Â 
Anabolic reactions describe the set of metabolic reactions that build up
complex molecules from simpler ones

The synthesis of organic molecules via anabolism typically occurs via
condensation reactions

Condensation reactions occur when monomers are covalently joined and
water is produced as a by-product

-   Monosaccharides are joined via glycosidic linkages to form
    disaccharides and polysaccharides
-   Amino acids are joined via peptide bonds to make polypeptide
    chainsÂ 
-   Glycerol and fatty acids are joined via an ester linkage to create
    triglycerides
-   Nucleotides are joined by phosphodiester bonds to form
    polynucleotide chains

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Catabolism is the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler
molecules including the hydrolysis ofÂ 

Â  Â macromolecules into monomers

Â  Â Â 
Catabolic reactions describe the set of metabolic reactions that break
complex molecules down into simpler molecules

The breakdown of organic molecules via catabolism typically occurs via
hydrolysis reactions

Hydrolysis reactions require the consumption of water molecules to break
the bonds within the polymer

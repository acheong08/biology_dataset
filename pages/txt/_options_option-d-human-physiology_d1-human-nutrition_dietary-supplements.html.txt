Dietary Supplements

Artificial supplementation ensures a population has sufficient access to
essential nutrients

-   Supplements may be added to natural dietary sources or taken
    independently with meals (e.g. vitamin tablets)
-   The cost to supplement dietary products is minimal compared to the
    cost of treating deficiency diseases

Examples of dietary supplementation include:

-   Production of iodised salt to prevent iodine deficiencies like
    goitre (iodine is important for thyroxine production)
-   Fluoridation of water supplies to protect teeth against decay
    (fluorine is important in tooth development)

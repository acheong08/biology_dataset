Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3â€™ end of a
primer

â€¢ Â DNA replication is continuous on the leading strand and
discontinuous on the lagging strand

Â  Â Â 
DNA polymerase cannot initiate replication, it can only add new
nucleotides to an existing strand

For DNA replication to occur, an RNA primer must first be synthesised to
provide an attachment point for DNA polymerase

DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3â€™Â end of a primer, extending
the new chain in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction

-   Free nucleotides exist as deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) â€“
    they have 3 phosphate groups
-   DNA polymerase cleaves the two additional phosphates and uses the
    energy released to form a phosphodiester bond with the 3â€™Â end of
    a nucleotide chain

Leading versus Lagging Strands

Because double-stranded DNA is antiparallel, DNA polymerase must move in
opposite directions on the two strands

-   On the leading strand, DNA polymerase is moving towards the
    replication fork and so can copy continuously
-   On the lagging strand, DNA polymerase is moving away from the
    replication fork, meaning copying is discontinuous
    -   As DNA polymerase is moving away from helicase, it must
        constantly return to copy newly separated stretches of DNA
    -   This means the lagging strand is copied as a series of short
        fragments (Okazaki fragments), each preceded by a primer
    -   The primers are replaced with DNA bases and the fragments joined
        together by a combination of DNA pol I and DNA ligase

D6 Â Transport of Respiratory Gases

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Red blood cells are vital in the
transport of respiratory gases

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Oxygen dissociation curves show the affinity of haemoglobin for
    oxygen
-   Carbon dioxide is carried in solution and bound to haemoglobin in
    the blood
-   Carbon dioxide is transformed in red blood cells into hydrogen
    carbonate ions
-   The Bohr shift explains the increased release of oxygen by
    haemoglobin in respiring tissues
-   Chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in blood pH
-   The rate of ventilation is controlled by the respiratory control
    centre in the medulla oblongata
-   During exercise the rate of ventilation changes in response to the
    amount of CO₂ in the blood
-   Fetal haemoglobin is different from adult haemoglobin allowing the
    transfer of oxygen in the placenta onto theÂ fatal haemoglobin

Applications:

-   Consequences of high altitude for gas exchange
-   pH of blood is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to
    7.45
-   Causes and treatments of emphysema

Skills:

-   Analysis of oxygen dissociation curves for haemoglobin and myoglobin
-   Identification ofÂ pneumocytes, capillary endothelium cells and
    blood cells in light micrographs and electron micrographs of lung
    tissue

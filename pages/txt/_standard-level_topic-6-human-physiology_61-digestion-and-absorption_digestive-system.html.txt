Skill:

â€¢ Â Production of an annotated diagram of the digestive system

Â  Â Â 
There are two major groups of organs which comprise the human digestive
system:

-   The alimentary canal consists of organs through which food actually
    passes (oesophagus, stomach, small & large intestine)
-   The accessory organs aid in digestion but do not actually transfer
    food (salivary glands, pancreas, liver, gall bladder)

Alimentary Canal:

[oesophagus icon]

Oesophagus

â€¢ Â A hollow tube connecting the oral cavity to the stomach (separated
from the trachea by the epiglottis)

â€¢ Â Food is mixed with saliva and then is moved in a bolus via the
action of peristalsis

[stomach icon]

Stomach

â€¢ Â A temporary storage tank where food is mixed by churning and
protein digestion begins

â€¢ Â It is lined by gastric pits that release digestive juices, which
create an acidic environment (pH ~2)

[small intestine icon]

Small Intestine

â€¢ Â A long, highly folded tube where usable food substances
(nutrients) are absorbed

â€¢ Â Consists of three sections â€“ the duodenum, jejunum and ileum

[large intestine icon]

Large Intestine

â€¢ Â The final section of the alimentary canal, where water and
dissolved minerals (i.e. ions) are absorbed

â€¢ Â Consists of the ascending / transverse / descending / sigmoidal
colon, as well as the rectumÂ 

Accessory Organs:

[salivary gland icon]

Salivary Glands

â€¢ Â Release saliva to moisten food and contains enzymes (e.g. amylase)
to initiate starch breakdownÂ 

â€¢ Â Salivary glands include the parotid gland, submandibular gland and
sublingual gland

[pancreas icon]

Pancreas

â€¢ Â Produces a broad spectrum of enzymes that are released into the
small intestine via the duodenum

â€¢ Â Also secretes certain hormones (insulin, glucagon), which regulate
blood sugar concentrationsÂ 

[liver icon]

Liver

â€¢ Â Takes the raw materials absorbed by the small intestine and uses
them to make key chemicals

â€¢ Â Its role includes detoxification, storage, metabolism, bile
production and haemoglobin breakdown

[gall bladder icon]

Gall Bladder

â€¢ Â The gall bladder stores the bile produced by the liver (bile salts
are used to emulsify fats)

â€¢ Â Bile stored in the gall bladder is released into the small
intestine via the common bile duct

Drawing of a Human Digestive System

[digestive system drawing]

Key Features:

-   Stomach should look like aÂ â€˜Jâ€™-shaped bag and be connected to
    the oesophagus and small intestine
-   Liver should look like a right-angled triangle and be superimposed
    to the left of the stomach (right side of the human)
-   Bile duct (connected to gall bladder) and pancreatic duct should
    both feed into a U-shaped bend of the small intestine
-   Small intestine should be thinner in width than the large intestine

â€¢ Â Production of human insulin in bacteria as an example of the
universality of the genetic code allowingÂ 

Â  Â for gene transfer between species

Â  Â Â 
The genetic code is universal â€“ almost every living organism uses the
same code (there are a few rare and minor exceptions)

-   As the same codons code for the same amino acids in all living
    things, genetic information is transferrable between species

The ability to transfer genes between species has been utilised to
produce human insulin in bacteria (for mass production)

-   The gene responsible for insulin production is extracted from a
    human cell
-   It is spliced into a plasmid vector (for autonomous replication and
    expression) before being inserted into a bacterial cell
-   The transgenic bacteria (typically E. coli) are then selected and
    cultured in a fermentation tank (to increase bacterial numbers)
-   The bacteria now produce human insulin, which is harvested, purified
    and packaged for human use (i.e. by diabetics)

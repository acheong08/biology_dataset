A5 Â Neuropharmacology

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Communication between neurons can be altered through the
manipulation of the release and reception of chemical messengers

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Some neurotransmitters excite nerve impulses in postsynaptic neurons
    and others inhibit them
-   Nerve impulses are initiated or inhibited in postsynaptic neurons as
    a result of summation of all excitatory and inhibitory
    neurotransmitters received from presynaptic neurons
-   Many different slow acting neurotransmitters modulate fast synaptic
    transmission in the brain
-   Memory and learning involve changes in neurons caused by slow-acting
    neurotransmitters
-   Psychoactive drugs affect the brain by either increasing or
    decreasing postsynaptic transmission
-   Anaesthetics act by interfering with neural transmission between
    areas of sensory perception and the CNS
-   Stimulant drugs mimic the stimulation provided by the sympathetic
    nervous system
-   Addiction can be affected by genetic predisposition, social
    environment and dopamine secretion

Applications:

-   Effects on the nervous system of two stimulants and two sedatives
-   The effect of anaesthetics on awareness
-   Endorphins can act as painkillers

Skill:

-   Evaluation of data showing the impact of MDMA (ecstasy) on serotonin
    and dopamine metabolism in the brain

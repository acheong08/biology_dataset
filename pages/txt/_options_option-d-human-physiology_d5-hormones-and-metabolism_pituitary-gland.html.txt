Understanding:

â€¢ Â The hypothalamus controls hormone secretion by the anterior and
posterior lobes of the pituitary gland

Â  Â Â 
Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the section of the brain that links the nervous and
endocrine systems in order to maintain homeostasis

-   It receives information from nerves throughout the body and other
    parts of the brain and initiates endocrine responses
-   It secretes neurochemicals (called releasing factors) into a portal
    system which target the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland
-   It also secretes hormones directly into the blood via neurosecretory
    cells that extend into the posterior pituitary lobe

Pituitary Gland

The pituitary gland lies adjacent to the hypothalamus and is in direct
contact due to a portal blood system

-   The pituitary gland receives instructions from the hypothalamus and
    consists of two lobes (anterior and posterior lobe)

Anterior Lobe

-   The anterior lobe is also called the
    adenohypophysisÂ (â€˜adenoâ€™Â = relating to glands)
-   The hypothalamus produces releasing factors, which are released into
    portal vessels by neurosecretory cells
-   The releasing factors cause endocrine cells in the anterior
    pituitary to release specific hormones into the bloodstream
    -   An example of a releasing factor is GnRH, which triggers the
        release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary

Posterior Lobe

-   The posterior lobe is also called the neurohypophysisÂ (â€˜neuroâ€™
    = relating to nerves)
-   The posterior lobe releases hormones produced by the hypothalamus
    itself (via neurosecretory cells)
-   These neurosecretory cells extend into the posterior lobe from the
    hypothalamus and release hormones into the blood

Endocrine Signalling via the Pituitary Gland

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hormones secreted by the pituitary control growth, developmental
changes, reproduction and homeostasis

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ pituitary gland is often referred to as theÂ â€˜master glandâ€™, as
it controls the secretion of a number of other endocrine glands

-   Pituitary hormones will often target endocrine glands in other
    organs (e.g. gonads, pancreas, thyroid, mammary gland)

[marge]

Pituitary hormones hence control many vital body processes, including:

-   MetabolismÂ  (e.g. TSH activates thyroxin)
-   Adult DevelopmentÂ  (e.g. LH / FSH trigger puberty)
-   ReproductionÂ  (e.g. LH / FSH control menstruation)
-   Growth Â (e.g. growth hormone promotes growth)
-   Equilibrium / Homeostasis Â (e.g. ADH and water balance)

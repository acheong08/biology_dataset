Summation

Presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters into the synapse to
trigger graded potentials in post-synapticÂ neurons

-   Some generate excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and others
    produce inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs)
-   EPSPs trigger depolarisation in the post-synaptic membrane, IPSPs
    trigger hyperpolarisation in the post-synaptic membrane
-   If the combination of signals reaches a threshold level, an action
    potential will be triggered in the post-synapticÂ neuron

The combination of graded potentials in the post-synaptic neuron is
known as summation

-   Cancellation occurs when excitatory and inhibitory graded potentials
    cancel each other out (no threshold potential reached)
-   Spatial summation occurs when EPSPs are generated from multiple
    presynaptic neurons simultaneously to reach threshold
-   Temporal summation occurs when multiple EPSPs are generated from a
    single presynaptic neuron in quick succession

These summative effects determine which nerve pathways are activated and
hence lead to alternate decision-making processes

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Cellular membranes possess two key qualities:

-   They are semi-permeable (only certain materials may freely cross â€“
    large and charged substances are typically blocked)
-   They are selective (membrane proteins may regulate the passage of
    material that cannot freely cross)

Movement of materials across a biological membrane may occur either
actively or passively

Passive Transport

Passive transport involves the movement of material along a
concentration gradient (high concentrationÂ â‡’Â low concentration)

Because materials are moving down a concentration gradient, it does not
require the expenditure of energy (ATP hydrolysis)

There are three main types of passive transport:

-   Simple diffusion â€“ movement of small or lipophilic molecules (e.g.
    O₂, CO₂, etc.)
-   Osmosis â€“ movement of water molecules (dependent on solute
    concentrations)
-   Facilitated diffusion â€“ movement of large or charged molecules via
    membrane proteins (e.g. ions, sucrose, etc.)

Active Transport

Active transport involves the movement of materials against a
concentration gradientÂ (low concentrationÂ â‡’Â high concentration)

Because materials are moving against the gradient, it requires the
expenditure of energy (e.g. ATP hydrolysis)

There are two main types of active transport:

-   Primary (direct) active transport â€“ Involves the direct use of
    metabolic energy (e.g. ATP hydrolysis) to mediate transport
-   Secondary (indirect) active transport â€“ Involves coupling the
    molecule with another moving along an electrochemical gradient

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The origin of eukaryotic cells can be explained by the
endosymbiotic theory

Â  Â Â 
An endosymbiont is a cell which lives inside another cell with mutual
benefit

Eukaryotic cells are believed to have evolved fromÂ early prokaryotes
that were engulfed by phagocytosis

The engulfed prokaryotic cell remained undigested as it contributed new
functionality to the engulfing cell (e.g. photosynthesis)

Over generations, the engulfed cell lost some of its independent utility
and became a supplemental organelle

Overview of the Process of Endosymbiosis

Evidence for Endosymbiosis

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are both organelles suggested to have
arisen via endosymbiosis

Evidence that supports the extracellular origins of these organelles can
be seen by looking at certain key features:

-   Membranes (double membrane bound)
-   Antibiotics (susceptibility)
-   Division (mode of replication)
-   DNA (presence and structural composition)
-   Ribosomes (size)

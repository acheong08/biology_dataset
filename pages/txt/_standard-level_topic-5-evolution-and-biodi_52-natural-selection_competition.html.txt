Understanding:

â€¢ Â Species tend to produce more offspring than the environment can
support

Â  Â Â 
The Malthusian dilemma was proposed by English clergyman Thomas Malthus
who identified that populations multiply geometrically (i.e. exponential
progression), while food resources only increase arithmetically (i.e.
linear progression)

-   In other words, species tend to produce more offspring than the
    environment can sustainably support

If left to follow course, a stable population will inevitably outgrow
its resource base, leading to competition for survival

-   When there is an abundance of resources, Â a population will grow
    according to its biotic potential (exponential J-curve)
-   With more offspring, there are less resources available to other
    members of the population (environmental resistance)
-   This will lead to a struggle for survival and an increase in the
    mortality rate (causing population growth to slow and plateau)

This concept is central to Darwinâ€™s understanding ofÂ â€˜survival of
the fittestâ€™ â€“ any trait that is beneficial for competitive survival
will be more likely to be passed on to offspring according to natural
selection

Application:

â€¢ Â Adaptations of plants in deserts and in saline soils for water
conservation

Â  Â Â 
Desert plants (xerophytes) and plants that grow in high salinity
(halophytes) possess various adaptations for water conservation

-   Xerophytes will have high rates of transpiration due to the high
    temperatures and low humidity of desert environments
-   Halophytes will lose water as the high intake of salt from the
    surrounding soils will draw water from plant tissue via osmosis

Xerophytes

Xerophytes are plants that canÂ tolerate dry conditions (such as
deserts) due to the presence of a number of adaptations:

-   Reduced leaves â€“ reducing the total number and size of leaves will
    reduce the surface area available for water loss
-   Rolled leaves â€“ rolling up leaves reduces the exposure of stomata
    to the air and hence reduces evaporative water loss
-   Thick, waxy cuticle â€“ having leaves covered by a thickened cuticle
    prevents water loss from the leaf surfaceÂ 
-   Stomata in pits â€“ having stomata in pits, surrounded by hairs,
    traps water vapour and hence reduces transpiration
-   Low growth â€“ low growing plants are less exposed to wind and more
    likely to be shaded, reducing water loss
-   CAM physiology â€“ plants with CAM physiology open their stomata at
    night, reducing water loss via evaporation

Halophytes

Halophytes are plants that can tolerate salty conditions (such as
marshlands) due to the presence of a number of adaptations:

-   Cellular sequestration â€“ halophytes can sequester toxic ions and
    salts within the cell wall or vacuoles
-   Tissue partitioning â€“ plants may concentrate salts in particular
    leaves, which then drop off (abscission)
-   Root level exclusion â€“ plant roots may be structured to exclude
    ~95% of the salt in soil solutions
-   Salt excretion â€“ certain parts of the plant (e.g. stem) may
    contain salt glands which actively eliminate salt
-   Altered flowering schedule â€“ halophytes may flower at specific
    timesÂ (e.g. rainy seasons) to minimise salt exposureÂ

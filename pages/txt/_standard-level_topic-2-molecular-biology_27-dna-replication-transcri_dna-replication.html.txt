Understanding:

â€¢ Â Helicase unwinds the double helix and separates the two strands by
breaking hydrogen bonds

â€¢ Â DNA polymerase links nucleotides together to form a new strand,
using the pre-existing strand as a template

Â  Â Â 
DNA replication is a semi-conservative process whereby pre-existing
strands act as templates for newly synthesised strands

The process of DNA replication is coordinated by two key enzymes
â€“Â helicase and DNA polymerase

Helicase

-   Helicase unwinds the double helix and separates the two
    polynucleotide strands
-   It does this by breaking the hydrogen bonds that exist between
    complementary base pairs
-   The two separated polynucleotide strands will act as templates for
    the synthesis of new complementary strands

DNA Polymerase

-   DNA polymerase synthesises new strands from the two parental
    template strands
-   Free deoxynucleoside triphosphates (nucleotides with 3 phosphate
    groups) align opposite their complementary base partner
-   DNA polymerase cleaves the two excess phosphates and uses the energy
    released to link the nucleotide to the new strand

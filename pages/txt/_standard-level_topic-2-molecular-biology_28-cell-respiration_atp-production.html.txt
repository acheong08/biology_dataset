Cell respiration is the controlled release of energy from organic
compounds to produce ATP

-   The main organic compound used for this process is carbohydrates
    (glucose), although lipids and proteins can also be digested

There are two main types of cell respiration:

-   Anaerobic respiration involves the partial breakdown of glucose in
    the cytosol for a small yield of ATP
-   Aerobic respiration utilises oxygen to completely break down glucose
    in the mitochondria for a larger ATP yield

Understanding:

â€¢ Â ATP from cell respiration is immediately available as a source of
energy in the cell

Â  Â Â 
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a high energy molecule that functions as
an immediate source of power for cell processes

-   One molecule of ATP contains three covalently linked phosphate
    groups â€“ which store potential energy in their bonds
-   When ATP is hydrolysed (to form ADP + Pi) the energy stored in the
    phophate bond is released to be used by the cell
-   Cell respiration uses energy stored in organic molecules to
    regenerate ATP from ADP + Pi (via oxidation)Â

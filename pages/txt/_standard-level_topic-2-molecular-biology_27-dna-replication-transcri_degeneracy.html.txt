Degeneracy

The genetic code has only ~20 amino acids but has 64 different codon
combinations

-   Consequently, the genetic code is said to show degeneracy â€“ more
    than one codon may code for a single amino acid

Due to the shape of the tRNA molecule, the third base of an anticodon is
not orientated optimally for base pairing

-   Consequently, this third base is less discriminatory towards
    complementary pairingÂ 
-   This is why degeneracy always occurs in the third base of a
    codonÂ (this site is known as the wobble position)

Degeneracy of the genetic code allows for the occurrence of silent
mutations â€“ whereby a change in the DNA sequence does not alter the
polypeptide sequence

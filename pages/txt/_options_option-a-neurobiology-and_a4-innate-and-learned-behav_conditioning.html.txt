Understanding:

â€¢ Â Reflex conditioning involves forming new associations

Â  Â Â 
Conditioning is a process of behaviour modification whereby desired
behaviours become associated with unrelated stimuli

-   This process can be achieved via either classical (reflex)
    conditioning or operant (instrumental) conditioning

Reflex conditioning involves placing a neutral signal before a reflex in
order to create an association between the two

-   Reflex conditioning focuses on involuntary and autonomic behaviours
-   It involves associating a desired behaviour with a new stimulus

Operant conditioning involves applying reinforcement or punishment after
a behaviour to increase or reduce its occurrence

-   Operant conditioning focuses on strengthening or weakening voluntary
    behaviours
-   It involves associating a particular behaviour with a specific
    consequence (either reward or punishment)

Application:

â€¢ Â Pavlovâ€™s experiments into reflex conditioning in dogs

Â  Â Â 
Reflex Conditioning

Reflex conditioning was first described by Ivan Pavlov, a Russian
physiologist who experimented on dogs

-   Dogs normally salivate (unconditioned response) in anticipation of
    being fed (unconditioned stimulus)
-   Pavlov sounded a bell (neutral stimulus) prior to feeding a dog
-   After many repetitions, the dog came to associate the bell with food
    and began to salivate to the bell (conditioned response)
-   Pavlov described this as a conditioned reflex â€“ the stimulus that
    prompted the response had been changed

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Operant conditioning is a form of learning that consists of trial
and error experiences

Â  Â Â 
Operant Conditioning

Operant conditioning was first described by B. F. Skinner, an American
psychologist who experimented on rats

-   Rats were placed in a controlled chamber (called a Skinner box) that
    contained a responsive lever
-   The pushing of the lever by the rat was accidental but resulted in
    several possible outcomes, including:
    -   The delivery of food in response to light (desirable outcome =
        positive reinforcement)
    -   The silencing of a loud noise from a speaker (desirable outcome
        = negative reinforcement)
    -   The activation of an electrified floor if not pressed in
        response to light (negative outcome = punishment)
-   By trial and error, the mice learned to press the lever in response
    to the different environmental contexts

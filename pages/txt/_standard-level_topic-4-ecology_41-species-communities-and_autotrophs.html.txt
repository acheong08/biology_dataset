Understanding:

â€¢ Â Autotrophs obtain inorganic nutrients from the abiotic environment

Â  Â Â 
Autotrophs synthesise organic molecules from simple inorganic substances

-   Most autotrophs derive the energy for this process from sunlight
    (via photosynthesis)
-   Some may derive the needed energy from the oxidation of inorganic
    chemicals (chemosynthesis)

Autotrophs obtain the simple inorganic substances required for this
process from the abiotic environment

-   These nutrients â€“ including carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and
    phosphorus â€“ are obtained from the air, water and soil

Heterotrophs also may obtain some simple inorganic substances from the
environment, but principally obtain their carbon and nitrogen from the
organic molecules produced by autotrophs

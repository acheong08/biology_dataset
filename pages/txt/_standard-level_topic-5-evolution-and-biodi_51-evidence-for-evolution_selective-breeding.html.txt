Understanding:

â€¢ Â Selective breeding of domesticated animals shows that artificial
selection can cause evolution

Â  Â Â 
Selective breeding is a form of artificial selection, whereby man
intervenes in the breeding of species to produce desired traits in
offspring

-   By breeding members of a species with a desired trait, the traitâ€™s
    frequency becomes more common in successive generations
-   Selective breeding provides evidence of evolution as targeted breeds
    can show significant variation in a (relatively) short period

Selective breeding of plant crops has allowed for the generation of new
types of foods from the same ancestral plant source

-   Plants of the genusÂ Brassica have been bred to produce different
    foods by modifying plant sections through artificial selection
-   This includes broccoli (modified flower buds), cabbage (modified
    leaf buds) and kale (modified leaves)

Selective breeding of domesticated animals has also resulted in the
generation of diverse breeds of offspring

-   Examples of selective breeding of domesticated animals can be seen
    in horse, cows and dogs

Example 1: Â Horse Breeding

Horses have been selectively bred across many generations to produce
variation according to a targeted function

-   Race horses have been bred for speed and hence are typically leaner,
    lighter, taller and quicker
-   Draft horses have been bred for power and endurance and hence are
    sturdier and stockier

Example 2: Â Cow Breeding

Cows have been selectively bred across many generations to produce
offspring with improved milk production

Farmers have also targeted the breeding a cows with a mutation resulting
in increased muscle mass

-   The resulting stock of cattle (termed Belgian Blue) have excessive
    bulk and produce more edible lean meat

Example 3: Â Dog Breeding

Dog breeds show an enormous amount of variety due to the targeted
selection of particular traits by man

-   Hunting dogs (e.g. beagles) were typically bred to be smaller in
    stature so as to enter fox holes
-   Herding dogs (e.g. sheep dogs) were bred for heightened intelligence
    in order to follow herding commands
-   Racing dogs (e.g. greyhounds) were specifically bred to be sleek and
    fastÂ 
-   Toy dogs (e.g. chihuahuas) were selectively bred for their
    dimunitive size

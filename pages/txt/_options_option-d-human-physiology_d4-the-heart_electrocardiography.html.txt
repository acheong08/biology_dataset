â€¢ Â Mapping of the cardiac cycle to a normal ECG trace

Â  Â Â 
The cardiac cycle describes the series of events that take place in the
heart over the duration of a single heart beat

-   It is comprised of a period of contraction (systole) and relaxation
    (diastole)

The cardiac cycle can be mapped by recording the electrical activity of
the heart with each contraction

-   Activity is measured using a machine called an electrocardiograph to
    generate data called an electrocardiogram
-   Hint: Â In a similar fashion, you use a telegraph (machine) to send
    a telegram (data)

Each normal heart beat should follow the same sequence of electrical
events:

-   TheÂ P waveÂ represents depolarisation of the atria in response to
    signalling from the sinoatrial node (i.e. atrial contraction)
-   TheÂ QRS complexÂ represents depolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular contraction), triggered by signals from the AV node
-   TheÂ T waveÂ represents repolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular relaxation) and the completion of a standard heart beat
-   Between these periods of electrical activity are intervals allowing
    for blood flow (PR intervalÂ andÂ ST segment)

Electrical Activity of the Heart

Examples of Heart Conditions

Data generated via electrocardiography can be used to identify a variety
of heart conditions, including:

-   TachycardiaÂ (elevated resting heart rate = >120Â bpm)
    andÂ bradycardiaÂ (depressed resting heart rate = < 40 bpm)
-   ArrhythmiasÂ (irregular heart beats that are so common in young
    people that it is not technically considered a disease)
-   FibrillationsÂ (unsynchronised contractions of either atria or
    ventricles leading to dangerously spasmodic heart activity)

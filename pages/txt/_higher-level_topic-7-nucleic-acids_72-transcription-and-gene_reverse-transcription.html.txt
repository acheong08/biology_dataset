Reverse Transcription

In 1970 it was discovered that retroviruses could copy DNA from an RNA
sequence

-   These viruses possess an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that allows
    for reverse transcription to occur
-   Reverse transcription is now commonly used in scientific studies to
    establish gene expression profiles

cDNA

-   Complementary DNA (cDNA) is a molecule synthesised from an mRNA
    template via reverse transcription
-   cDNA molecules represent gene sequences that areÂ actively
    transcribedÂ by a cell (as they were synthesised from mRNA)Â 
-   This makes them a valuable tool for determining expression patterns
    of proteins in normal and diseased states
-   cDNA molecules are also commonly used in gene transfer experiments
    as they do not possess introns

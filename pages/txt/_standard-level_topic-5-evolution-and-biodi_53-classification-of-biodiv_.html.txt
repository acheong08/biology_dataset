5.3 Â Classification of Biodiversity

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Species are named and classified
using an internationally agreed system

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The binomial system of names for species is universal among
    biologists and has been agreed and developed at a series of
    congresses
-   When species are discovered they are given scientific names using
    the binomial system
-   All organisms are classified into three domains
-   Taxonomists classify species using a hierarchy of taxa
-   The principal taxa for classifying eukaryotes are kingdom, phylum,
    class, order, family, genus and species
-   In a natural classification, the genus and accompanying higher taxa
    consists of all the species that have evolved from one common
    ancestral species
-   Taxonomists sometimes reclassify groups of species when new evidence
    shows that a previous taxon contains species that have evolved from
    different ancestral species
-   Natural classifications help in identification of species and allow
    the prediction of characteristics shared by species within a group

Applications:

-   Classification of one plant and one animal species from domain to
    species level
-   Recognition features of bryophyta, filicinophyta, coniferophyta and
    angiospermophyta
-   Recognition features ofÂ porifera, cnidaria,Â platyhelmintha,
    annelida, mollusca, arthropoda and chordata
-   Recognition features of birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles and
    fish

Skills

-   Construction of dichotomous keys for use in identifying specimens

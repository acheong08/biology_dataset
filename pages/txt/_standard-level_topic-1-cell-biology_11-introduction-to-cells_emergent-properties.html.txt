Understanding:

â€¢ Â Multicellular organisms have properties that emerge from the
interaction of their cellular components

Â  Â Â 
Emergent properties arise when the interaction of individual component
produce new functions

-   "The whole is greater than the sum of its partsâ€?Â â€“ Aristotle

Multicellullar organisms are capable of completing functions that
unicellular organisms could not undertake â€“ this is due to the
collective actions of individual cells combining to create new
synergistic effects
In multicellular organisms:

-   Cells may be grouped together to form tissues
-   Organs are then formed from the functional grouping of multiple
    tissues
-   Organs that interact may form organ systems capable of carrying out
    specific body functions
-   Organ systems collectively carry out the life functions of the
    complete organism

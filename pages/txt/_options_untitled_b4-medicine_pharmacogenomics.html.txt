Pharmacogenomics

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how an individualâ€™s genes affect
their response to drugs

-   All individuals have a unique genetic profile and hence will
    metabolise pharmaceutical compounds differently
-   This will determine how effective a particular drug is at treating a
    disease condition, as well as the dosage required

Pharmacogenomics is used to develop optimal drug therapies that take
into account an individualâ€™s genotype

-   Drugs are chosen to ensure maximum efficiency with minimal side
    effects
-   Through pharmocogenomics, different patients may be prescribed
    different medications for the same disease condition

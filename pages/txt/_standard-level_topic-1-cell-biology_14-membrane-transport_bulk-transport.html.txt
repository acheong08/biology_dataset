Understanding:

â€¢ Â The fluidity of membranes allows materials to be taken into cells
by endocytosis or released by exocytosisÂ 

Â  Â Â 
The membrane is principally held together by weak hydrophobic
associations between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids

This weak association allows for membrane fluidity and flexibility, as
the phospholipids can move around to some extent

This allows for the spontaneous breaking and reforming of the bilayer,
allowing larger materials to enter or leave the cell without having to
cross the membrane (this is an active process and requires ATP
hydrolysis)

[cytosis]

Endocytosis

The process by which large substances (or bulk amounts of smaller
substances) enter the cell without crossing the membrane

-   An invagination of the membrane forms a flask-like depression which
    envelopes the extracellular material
-   The invagination is then sealed off to form an intracellular vesicle
    containing the material

There are two main types of endocytosis:

-   Phagocytosis â€“ The process by which solid substances are ingested
    (usually to be transported to the lysosome)
-   Pinocytosis â€“ The process by which liquids / dissolved substances
    are ingested (allows faster entry than via protein channels)Â

Exocytosis

The process by which large substances (or bulk amounts of small
substances) exit the cell without crossing the membrane

-   Vesicles (typically derived from the Golgi) fuse with the plasma
    membrane, expelling their contents into the extracellular
    environment
-   The process of exocytosis adds vesicular phospholipids to the cell
    membrane, replacing those lost when vesicles are formed via
    endocytosis

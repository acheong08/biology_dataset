Understanding:

â€¢ Â Metabolic pathways consist of chains and cycles of
enzyme-catalysed reactions

Â  Â Â 
Metabolism describes the sum total of all reactions that occur within an
organism in order to maintain life

-   Most chemical changes in a cell result from a series of reactions
    (pathways), with each step controlled by a specific enzyme
-   Metabolic pathways allow for a greater level of regulation, as the
    chemical change is controlled by numerous intermediates

Metabolic pathways are typically organised into chains or cycles of
enzyme-catalysed reactions

-   Examples of chains: Â Glycolysis (in cell respiration), coagulation
    cascade (in blood clotting)
-   Examples of cycles: Â Krebs cycle (in cell respiration), Calvin
    cycle (in photosynthesis)

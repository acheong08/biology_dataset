Understanding:

â€¢ Â White blood cells release histamine in response to allergens

Â  Â Â 
An allergen is an environmental substance that triggers an immune
response despite not being intrinsically harmful

-   This immune response tends to be localised to the region of exposure
    (e.g. airways and throat) as an allergic reaction
-   A severe systemic allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis and can be
    fatal if left untreatedÂ 

An allergic reaction requires a pre-sensitised immune state (i.e. prior
exposure to the allergen)

-   When a specific B cell first encounters the allergen, it
    differentiates into plasma cells and makes large quantities of
    antibody (IgE)
-   The IgE antibodies attach to mast cells, effectivelyÂ â€˜primingâ€™
    them towards the allergen
-   Upon re-exposure to the allergen, the IgE-primed mast cells release
    large amounts of histamine which causes inflammation

Stages of an Allergic Reaction

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Histamine causes allergic symptoms

Â  Â Â 
The release of histamine from IgE-primed mast cells causes an
inflammatory response that results in allergic symptoms

-   Inflammation improves leukocytes mobility to infected regions by
    triggering vasodilation and increasing capillary permeability

Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels to improve the circulation
of blood to targeted regions

-   Vasodilation causes redness (as vessel expansion moves blood closer
    to the skin) and heat (which is transported in blood)

Capillary permeability describes the capacity for leukocytes to leave
the bloodstream and migrate into the body tissueÂ 

-   Increased permeability leads to swelling (more fluid leaks from the
    blood) and pain (swelling causes compression of nerves)

Redness, heat, swelling and localised pain are all typical symptoms of
an allergic response

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Living organisms synthesise many different proteins with a wide
range of functions

Â  Â Â 
Proteins are a very diverse class of compounds and may serve a number of
different roles within a cell, including:

-   Structure â€“ e.g. collagen, spider silk
-   Hormones â€“ e.g. insulin, glucagon
-   Immunity â€“ e.g. immunoglobulins
-   Transport â€“ e.g. haemoglobin
-   Sensation â€“ e.g. rhodopsin
-   Movement â€“ e.g. actin, myosin
-   Enzymes â€“ e.g. Rubisco, catalase

Application:

â€¢ Â Rubisco, insulin, immunoglobulins, rhodopsin, collagen and spider
silk as examples of the range ofÂ 

Â  Â protein functions

Â  Â Â 
The following are specific examples of the different functions of
proteins:

Structure

-   Collagen: A component of the connective tissue of animals (most
    abundant protein in mammals)
-   Spider silk: A fiber spun by spiders and used to make webs (by
    weight, is stronger than kevlar and steel)

Hormones

-   Insulin: Protein produced by the pancreas and triggers a reduction
    in blood glucose levels
-   Glucagon: Protein produced by the pancreas that triggers an increase
    in blood glucose levels

Immunity

-   Immunoglobulins: Antibodies produced by plasma cells that are
    capable of targeting specific antigens

Transport

-   Haemoglobin: A protein found in red blood cells that is responsible
    for the transport of oxygen
-   Cytochrome: A group of proteins located in the mitochondria and
    involved in the electron transport chain

Sensation

-   Rhodopsin: A pigment in the photoreceptor cells of the retina that
    is responsible for the detection of light

Movement

-   Actin: Thin filaments involved in the contraction of muscle fibres
-   Myosin: Thick filaments involved in the contraction of muscle fibres

Enzymes

-   Rubisco: An enzyme involved in the light independent stage of
    photosynthesis

â€¢ Â Design of experiments to test the effect of temperature, pH and
substrate concentration on the

Â  Â activity of enzymes

Â  Â Â 
When designing an experiment to test the effect of factors affecting
enzyme activity, the three key decisions to be made are:

-   Which factor to investigate (i.e. the independent variable)
-   Which enzyme / substrate reaction to use
-   How to measure the enzyme activity (i.e. the dependent variable)

Choosing the Independent Variable

The main factors which will affect the activity of an enzyme on a given
substrate are:

-   Temperature (use water baths to minimise fluctuations)
-   pH (acidic or alkaline solutions)
-   Substrate concentration (choose range to avoid saturation)
-   Presence of inhibitor (type of inhibitor will be enzyme-specific)

Selecting an Enzyme and Substrate

Selection will depend onÂ availability within the school, however
certain enzymes can be extracted from common food sources

Examples of common enzyme-catalysed reactions include:

Measuring Enzyme Activity

The method of data collection will depend on the reaction occurring â€“
typically most reactions are measured according to:

-   The amount / rate of substrate decomposition (e.g. breakdown of
    starch)
-   The amount / rate of product formation (e.g. formation of maltose)

â€¢ Â Experimental investigation of a factor affecting enzyme activity

Â  Â Â 
Key things to consider when conducting an experimental investigation
into a factor affecting enzyme activity include:

-   What is an appropriate range of values to select for your
    independent variable?
-   Have you chosen a sufficient time period for the reaction to
    proceed?
-   Have you identified, and controlled, all relevant extraneous
    variables?
-   Can you include a negative control condition (no enzyme) to
    establish baseline readings?
-   Can you include a positive control condition to confirm enzyme
    activity?
-   Is it possible to treat the enzyme with the independent variable
    before mixing with the substrate?
-   Does the data collection method allow for sufficient precision in
    detecting changes to levels of product / substrate?
-   Have all appropriate safety precautions been taken when handling
    relevant substances?

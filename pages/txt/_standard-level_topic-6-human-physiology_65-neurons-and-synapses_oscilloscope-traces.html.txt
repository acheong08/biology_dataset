â€¢ Â Analysis of oscilloscope traces showing resting potentials and
action potentials

Â  Â Â 
Oscilloscopes are scientific instruments that are used to measure the
membrane potential across a neuronal membrane

-   Data is displayed as a graph, with timeÂ (in milliseconds) on the X
    axis and membrane potential (in millivolts) on the Y axis

A typical action potential will last for roughly 3 â€“ 5 milliseconds
and contain 4 key stages:

-   Resting potential: Â Before the action potential occurs, the neuron
    should be in a state of rest (approx. â€“70 mV)
-   Depolarisation: Â A rising spike corresponds to the depolarisation
    of the membrane via sodium influx (up to roughly +30 mV)
-   Repolarisation: Â A falling spike corresponds to repolarisation via
    potassium efflux (undershoots to approx. â€“80 mV)
-   Refractory period: Â The oscilloscope trace returns to the level of
    the resting potential (due to the action of the Na⁺/K⁺ pump)

An action potential will only occur if the initial depolarisation
exceeds a threshold potential of approximately â€“55 mV

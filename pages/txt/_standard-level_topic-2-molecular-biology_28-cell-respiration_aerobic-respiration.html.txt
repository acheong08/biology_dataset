Understanding:

â€¢ Â Aerobic cell respiration requires oxygen and gives a large yield
of ATP from glucose

Â  Â Â 
Aerobic cell respiration requires the presence of oxygen and takes place
within the mitochondrion

Pyruvate is broken down into carbon dioxide and water, and a large
amount of ATP is produced (~34 â€“ 36 molecules)

Although aerobic respiration typically begins with glycolysisÂ in
carbohydrates, glycolysis itself is an anaerobic process

-   Aerobic respiration consists of the link reaction, citric acid cycle
    (or Krebs cycle) and the electron transport chain

Ecological Pyramids

Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of a specific component at
the different trophic levels of an ecosystem

-   The three main types of ecological pyramids measure species numbers,
    biomass and energy

Pyramid of Numbers

A pyramid of numbers shows the relative number of organisms at each
stage of a food chain

-   These are usually shaped like pyramids, as higher trophic levels
    cannot be sustained if there are more predators than prey
-   However, the shape may be distorted if a food source is
    disproportionately large in size / biomass compared to the feeder
    -   For example, a large number of caterpillars may feed on a single
        oak tree and many fleas may feed off a single dog host

Pyramid of Biomass

A pyramid of biomass shows the total mass of organisms at each stage of
a food chain

-   These pyramids are almost always upright in shape, as biomass
    diminishes along food chains as COâ‚‚ and waste is released
-   An exception to this rule is found in marine ecosystems, where
    zooplankton have a large total biomass than phytoplankton
    -   This is because phytoplankton replace their biomass at such a
        rapid rate and so can support a larger biomass of zooplankton

Pyramid of Energy

A pyramid of energy shows the amount of energy trapped per area in a
given time period at each stage of a food chain

-   These pyramids are always upright in shape, as energy is lost along
    food chains (either used in respiration or lost as heat)
-   Each level in the pyramid will be roughly one tenth the size of the
    preceding level as energy transformations are ~10% efficient

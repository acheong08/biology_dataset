Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some pollutants are metabolised by microorganisms

Â  Â Â 
A pollutant is a substance introduced into the environment that has an
adverse effect upon a natural resource

-   Certain pollutants may be disintegrated via the biological
    metabolism of microorganisms (biodegradation)

Examples of pollutants that may be metabolised by microorganisms
include:

-   Oil: Â Hydrocarbons in crude oil may be metabolised by Pseudomonas
-   Benzene: Â Aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene) may be metabolised
    by halophilic Marinobacter
-   Mercury: Â Toxic methyl mercury may be converted into environmental
    mercury by Pseudomonas
-   Uranium: Â Uranium can be converted by Geobacter sulfureducens into
    a insoluble form that can be easily collected

Application:

â€¢ Â Degradation of oil by Pseudomonas

â€¢ Â Degradation of benzene by halophilic bacteria such as Marinobacter

Oil Spills

Crude oil is a non-uniform material composed of a mixture of
hydrocarbons in variable proportions

-   It can be processed to form petroleum products that can be refined
    to form various types of fuels (e.g. gasoline, etc.)
-   When crude oil is released from containment (i.e. via damaged
    tankers or pipelines), it will form a floating slick on water

Crude oil is biodegradable and hence oil spills are commonly dispersed
by bacterial decomposition (bioremediation)

-   Physical procedures (such as the surface pumping of an oil slick)
    are highly laborious, expensive and slow
-   Chemical procedures (such as the use of dispersants) may be
    non-biodegradable and toxic to marine ecosystemsÂ 

Pseudomonas is a chemoheterotroph that can utilise crude oil as its sole
carbon source, making it efficient at oil degradation

-   The hydrocarbons within the oil are converted into biomass or broken
    down via respiration into carbon dioxide and water
-   Spraying the oil with essential inorganic nutrients (e.g. nitrates,
    phosphates, etc.) assists in the conversion to biomass
-   The efficiency of oil degradation can also be improved by the
    presence of a surfactant (helps distribute the bacteria)

A high presence of salt at an oil spill may inhibit bacterial species
(such asÂ Pseudomonas) from being able to degrade the oil

-   Oil spills commonly occur in marine environments â€“ oil is
    frequently extracted in off-shore locations and transported by ship
-   Additionally, the extraction of oil from underground reserviors is
    oftenÂ accompanied by brine (salt water)

Marinobacter are a halophilic ('salt-lovingâ€™) bacteria that can
degrade certain hydrocarbons present in crude oil (i.e. benzene)

-   Whilst not as efficient at degrading oil as Pseudomonas, its
    tolerance for salt environments makes it a useful alternative

Application:

â€¢ Â Conversion by Pseudomonas of methyl mercury into elemental mercury

Â  Â Â 
Mercury Contamination

Mercury exists in three forms: as a metal (elemental mercury), as
inorganic ions or as an organic form (methyl mercury)

-   Elemental mercury is produced as an industrial pollutant and is
    converted to the other forms by aquatic bacterial communities

Methyl mercury is the most toxic form and will accumulate within aquatic
ecosystems polluted by elemental mercury

-   Pseudomonas is capable of degrading the toxic methyl mercury to form
    elemental mercury and methane gas
-   This makes Pseudomonas an important biological agent in the
    treatment and remediation of mercury pollution

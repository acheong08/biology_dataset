Understanding:

â€¢ Â Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I

â€¢ Â Sister chromatids separate in meiosis II

Â  Â Â 
Meiosis consists of two divisions, both of which follow the same stages
as mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)

-   Meiosis is preceded byÂ interphase, in which DNA is replicated to
    produce chromosomes consisting of two sister chromatids
-   A second growth phase calledÂ interkinesisÂ may occur between
    meiosis I and II, however no DNA replication occurs in this stage

Meiosis I

The first meiotic division is a reduction
divisionÂ (diploidÂ â†’Â haploid)Â in which homologous chromosomes are
separatedÂ 

-   P-I:Â Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, homologous
    chromosomes form bivalents, crossing over occurs
-   M-I:Â Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes connect to bivalents
    (at centromeres) and align them along the middle of the cell
-   A-I:Â Spindle fibres contract and split the bivalent, homologous
    chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell
-   T-I:Â Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membraneÂ mayÂ reform, cell
    divides (cytokinesis) to form two haploid daughter cells

Meiosis II

The second division separates sister chromatids (these chromatids may
not be identical due to crossing over in prophase I)Â 

-   P-II:Â Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, centrosomes
    move to opposite poles (perpendicular to before)
-   M-II:Â Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes attach to
    chromosomes (at centromere) and align them along the cell equator
-   A-II:Â Spindle fibres contract and separate the sister chromatids,
    chromatids (now called chromosomes) move to opposite poles
-   T-II:Â Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membrane reforms, cells
    divide (cytokinesis) to form four haploid daughter cellsÂ 

The final outcome of meiosis is the production of four haploid daughter
cells

-   These cells may all be genetically distinct if crossing over occurs
    in prophase I (causes recombination of sister chromatids)

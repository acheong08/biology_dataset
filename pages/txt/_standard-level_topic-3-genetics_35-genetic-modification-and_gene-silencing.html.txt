Gene Silencing

Gene silencing refers to the ability of a cell to prevent the expression
of a particular gene

-   While this occurs naturally, it can also be induced by scientists to
    study gene interactions and potentially treat inherited diseases

Conditional Knockouts

A gene knockout is a genetic technique whereby a specific gene is
rendered inoperative within an organism

-   Using the Cre-LoxP system, this gene knockout can be targeted to
    specific tissues within the organism (conditional knockout)

The Cre-LoxP system uses the enzyme Cre recombinase to remove genetic
sequences located between two Lox sites

-   Using recombinant DNA technology, LoxP sequences are inserted on
    either side of a gene of interest in a test animal
-   The Cre gene is inserted next to a tissue-specific promoter in
    another test animal
-   When the two animals are bred, the resulting offspring will possess
    LoxP sequences and a tissue-specific Cre recombinase
-   The Cre recombinase will remove the gene located between the Lox
    sites to create a conditional knockout for further study

RNA Interference (RNAi)

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is
roughly 20 â€“ 25 base pairs in length

siRNA interferes with the expression of genes by causing the mRNA
transcripts to be broken prior to translation

-   Â When theÂ siRNA is unwound, one strand (the passenger strand) is
    degraded and one strand (the guide strand) remains
-   The guide strand will hybridise to its complementary mRNA sequence
    and recruit a protein complex called RISC
-   RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) will then destroy the targeted
    mRNA, preventing translation of the associated gene

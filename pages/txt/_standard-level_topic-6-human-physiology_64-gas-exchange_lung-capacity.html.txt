Lung Capacity

Lung capacities refer to the volumes of air associated with the
different phases of the respiratory cycle:

-   Total lung capacity â€“ Volume of air in the lungs after a maximal
    inhalation (~ 6 litres in a normal adult male)
-   Vital capacity â€“ Volume of air that can be exchanged by the lungs
    via a maximal inhalation and exhalation
-   Residual volume â€“ Volume of air that is always present in the
    lungs (~ 20% of total lung capacity)
-   Tidal volume â€“ Volume of air that is exchanged via normal
    breathing (~ 500 ml per breath)

Ventilation rate (breathing frequency) at rest for a typical adult is
roughly 12 â€“ 16 breaths per minute

-   Ventilation rate can be substantially increased with physical
    activity (maximal increase is roughly 5 â€“ 6 fold over normal)

A number of factors contribute to an individualâ€™s total lung capacity
and ventilation rate, including:

-   Height (taller people tend to have larger chests and hence larger
    total lung capacities)
-   Location (people living at high altitudes tend to have larger
    capacities to compensate for the lower atmospheric pressure)
-   Lifestyle (obese people and smokers tend to have lower capacities
    and higher rates of ventilation)

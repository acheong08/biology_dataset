Application:

â€¢ Â Discussion of the effect of natality, mortality, immigration and
emigration on population size

Â  Â Â 
The change in the size of a population over time is determined by four
key factors:

â€¢ Â Natality: Â Increases to population size through reproduction
(births)

â€¢ Â Immigration: Â Increases to population size from external
populations

â€¢ Â Mortality: Â Decreases to population size as a result of death

â€¢ Â Emigration: Â Decreases to population size due to loss to external
populations

The role of these factors in determining population size can be
summarised by the following equation:

-   Population Size = (Immigration + Natality) â€“ (Mortality +
    Emigration)

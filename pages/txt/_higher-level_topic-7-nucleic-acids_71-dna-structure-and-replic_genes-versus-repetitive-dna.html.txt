Genes versus Repetitive DNA

Current estimates suggest that the human genome is comprised of < 20,000
genes (roughly 1.5% of the total sequence)

The vast majority of the genome consists of non-coding DNA sequences,
much of which is repetitive

These highly repetitive DNA sequences differ from unique, single copy
gene sequences in a number of key respects:

-   Proportion: Highly repetitive DNA makes up a much greater proportion
    of the genome than gene sequences
-   Rate of mutation: Gene sequences have a lower mutation rate (as any
    errors may affect protein synthesis)
-   Occurrence: Gene sequences are typically unique and occur once in
    the genome, whereas repetitive DNA is recurring
-   Function: Gene sequences are translated and code for proteins,
    highly repetitive DNA sequences are typically non-coding
-   Identification: Repetitive DNA sequences are commonly used for DNA
    profiling, gene sequences are not (too similar)
-   Length: A gene is made of a long unique sequence, while repetitive
    DNA sequences are typically composed of short repeats
-   Example: An example of a gene sequence is an exon, while an intron
    may be an example of non-coding, repetitive DNA

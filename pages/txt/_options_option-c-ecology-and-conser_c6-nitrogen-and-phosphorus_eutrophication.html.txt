Understanding:

â€¢ Â Leaching of mineral nutrients from agricultural land into rivers
causes eutrophication and leads to increased

Â  Â  biochemical oxygen demand

Â  Â Â 
Eutrophication is the enrichment of an ecosystem (typically aquatic)
with chemical nutrients (nitrates, phosphates, etc.)

-   The nutrients can be introduced via leaching from soil by rainfall
    or released as part of sewage
-   Eutrophication is common around agricultural lands where the use
    ofÂ artificial fertilisers are prevalent

An increase in nutrient supply within waterways will result in several
ecological consequences:

-   A rapid growth in algal populations will occur (algal blooms) as a
    result of the increased availability of nutrients
-   As the algae die, there will be a subsequent spike in the numbers of
    saprotrophic microbes (decomposers)
-   The high rate of decomposition will result in an increased
    biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) by saprotrophic bacteria
-   The saprotrophs will consume available quantities of dissolved
    oxygen, leading to deoxygenation of the water supply
-   Eutrophication will also increase the turbidity of the water, which
    will reduce oxygen production by photosynthetic seaweeds
-   This will stress the survival of marine organisms, potentially
    leading to a reduction in biodiversity within the ecosystem

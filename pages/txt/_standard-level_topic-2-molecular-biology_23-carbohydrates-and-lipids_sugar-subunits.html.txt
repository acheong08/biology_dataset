Understanding:

â€¢ Â Monosaccharide monomers are linked together by condensation
reactions to form disaccharides and

Â  Â polysaccharide polymers

Â  Â Â 
Carbohydrates are made of C, H and O (â€˜carboâ€™Â â€“ contains carbon
;Â â€˜hydrateâ€™Â â€“ contains H and O)

Carbohydrates are composed of recurring monomers called monosaccharides
(which typically form ring structures)

These monosaccharides may be linked together via condensation reactions
(water is formed as a by-product)

-   Two monosaccharide monomers may be joined via a glycosidic linkage
    to form a disaccharide
-   Many monosaccharide monomers may be joined via glycosidic linkages
    to form polysaccharides

Formation of a Disaccharide

[disaccharide]

Examples of Carbohydrates

Monosaccharides (one sugar unit) are typically sweet-tasting and
function as an immediate energy source for cells

-   Examples of monosaccharides include glucose, galactose and fructose

Disaccharides (two sugar units) are small enough to be soluble in water
and commonly function as a transport form

-   Examples of disaccharides include lactose, maltose and sucrose

Polysaccharides (many sugar units) may be used for energy storage or
cell structure, and also play a role in cell recognition

-   Examples of polysaccharides include cellulose, glycogen and starch

Anti-Drug Vaccines

Anti-drug vaccines are being designed to help substance abusers overcome
particular drug addiction

-   Most addictive drugs activate the pleasure-reward pathways of the
    brain (i.e. promote dopamine secretion)
-   A fragment of the addictive drug is made into a vaccine, such that
    the body produces specific antibodies to the drug
-   The antibodies do not destroy the drug, but form a complex with it
    that is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier
-   As a result, the drug cannot activate the pleasure-reward pathways
    of the brain, eliminating its addictive effects
-   This therapy is currently being developed for a number of drugs â€“
    including nicotine, cocaine and heroin

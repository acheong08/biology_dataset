Understanding:

â€¢ Â Codons of three bases on mRNA correspond to one amino acid in a
polypeptide

â€¢ Â The amino acid sequence of polypeptides is determined by mRNA
according to the genetic code

Â  Â Â 
Codons

-   The base sequence of an mRNA molecule encodes the production of a
    polypeptide
-   The mRNA sequence is read by the ribosome in triplets of bases
    called codons
-   Each codon codes for one amino acid with a polypeptide chain
-   The order of the codons in an mRNA sequence determines the order of
    amino acids in a polypeptide chain

Genetic Code

-   The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded
    within mRNA sequences is converted into amino acid sequences
    (polypeptides) by living cells
-   The genetic code identifies the corresponding amino acid for each
    codon combination
-   As there are four possible bases in a nucleotide sequence, and three
    bases per codon, there are 64 codon possibilities (4³)
-   The coding region of an mRNA sequence always begins with a START
    codon (AUG) and terminates with a STOP codon

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use a table of the genetic code to deduce which codon(s)
correspond to which amino acid

Â  Â Â 
Typically the genetic code shows the codon combinations expressed on an
mRNA molecule

-   Tables displaying the genetic code may occasionally show the
    sequence on the sense strand of DNA (non-coding strand)
-   These sequences are identical to the mRNA codons with the exception
    of thymine (T) being present instead of uracil (U)

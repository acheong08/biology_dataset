Understanding:

â€¢ Â Specialised tissues can develop by cell differentiation in
multicellular organisms

â€¢ Â Differentiation involves the expression of some genes and not
others in a cellâ€™s genome

Â  Â Â 
Differentiation

Differentiation is the process during development whereby newly formed
cells become more specialised and distinct from one another as they
mature

All cells of an organism share anÂ identical genomeÂ â€“ each cell
contains theÂ entire set of genetic instructionsÂ for that organism

The activation of different instructions (genes) within a given cell by
chemical signals will cause it to differentiateÂ

Gene Packaging

Within the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, DNA is packaged with proteins
to form chromatin

-   Active genes are usually packaged in an expanded form called
    euchromatin that is accessible to transcriptional machinery
-   Inactive genes are typically packaged in a more condensed form
    called heterochromatin (saves space, not transcribed)

Differentiated cells will have different regions of DNA packaged as
euchromatin and heterochromatin according to their specific function

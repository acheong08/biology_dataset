Sex Determination

Human sex determination occurs according to the X - Y system

-   Females have two copies of the larger X chromosome
-   Males have one X and one Y chromosome (and hence determine gender in
    offspring)

Other Systems

X - 0 System

-   Common in certain insects, including grasshoppers and crickets
-   Females have two copies of the X chromosome (XX), whereas males only
    have one chromosome (X0)
-   Generally, in this method, sex is determined by the overall level of
    gene expression by the X chromosome (less in males)

Z - W System

-   Common in birds, some reptiles and certain insects
-   Males have two copies of the Z chromosome (ZZ), whereas females have
    one Z and one W chromosome (ZW)
-   Certain essential female genes appear to reside on the W chromosome
    (similar to the Y chromosome in human males)

Haplo-diploid System

-   Common in certain insect species, such as ants and bees
-   Unfertilised eggs develop into haploid individuals, which are males
-   Fertilised eggs develop into diploid individuals, which are
    generally female (all bar the reproductive queen are sterile)

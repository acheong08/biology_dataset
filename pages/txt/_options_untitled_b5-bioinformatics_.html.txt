B5 Â Bioinformatics

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Bioinformatics is the use of computers to
analyse sequence data in biological research

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Databases allow scientists easy access to information
-   The body of data stored in databases is increasing exponentially
-   BLAST searches can identify similar sequences in different organisms
-   Gene function can be studied using model organisms with similar
    sequences
-   Sequence alignment software allows comparison of sequences from
    different organisms
-   BLASTn allows nucleotide sequence alignment while BLASTp allows
    protein alignment
-   Databases can be searched to compare newly identified sequences with
    sequences of known function in other organisms
-   Multiple sequence alignment is used in the study ofÂ phylogenetics
-   EST is an expressed sequence tag that can be used to identify
    potential genes

Applications:

-   Use of knockout technology in mice to determine gene function
-   Discovery of genes by EST data mining

Skills:

-   Explore chromosome 21 in databases (for example inÂ Ensembl)
-   Use of software to align two proteins
-   Use of software to construct simple cladograms and phylograms of
    related organisms using DNA sequences

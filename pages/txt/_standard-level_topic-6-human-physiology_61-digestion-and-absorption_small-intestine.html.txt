small intestine viewed with a microscope or in aÂ

Â  Â Â 
The human intestines function to absorb the products of digestion and
have specialised structures to fulfil this function

-   The small intestine absorbs usable food substances (i.e. nutrients
    â€“ monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, etc.)
-   The large intestine absorbs water and dissolved minerals (i.e. ions)
    from the indigestible food residues

Structure of the Small Intestine

The small intestine is composed of four main tissue layers, which are
(from outside to centre):

-   Serosa â€“ a protective outer covering composed of a layer of cells
    reinforced by fibrous connective tissue
-   Muscle layer â€“ outer layer of longitudinal muscle (peristalsis)
    and inner layer of circular muscle (segmentation)
-   Submucosa â€“ composed of connective tissue separating the muscle
    layer from the innermost mucosa
-   Mucosa â€“ a highly folded inner layer which absorbs material
    through its surface epithelium from the intestinal lumen

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Villi increase the surface area of epithelium over which
absorption is carried out

â€¢ Â Villi absorb monomers formed by digestion as well as mineral ions
and vitamins

Â  Â Â 
The inner epithelial lining of the intestine is highly folded into
finger-like projections called villi (singular: villus)

-   Many villi will protrude into the intestinal lumen, greatly
    increasing the available surface area for material absorption

Features of Villi

Intestinal villi contain several key features which facilitate the
absorption of digestive products (monomers, ions and vitamins):
[Mr Slim]

-   Microvilli â€“ Ruffling of epithelial membrane further increases
    surface area
-   Rich blood supply â€“ Dense capillary network rapidly transports
    absorbed products
-   Single layer epithelium â€“ Minimises diffusion distance between
    lumen and blood
-   Lacteals â€“ Absorbs lipids from the intestine into the lymphatic
    system
-   Intestinal glands â€“ Exocrine pits (crypts of Lieberkuhn) release
    digestive juices
-   Membrane proteins â€“ Facilitates transport of digested materials
    into epithelial cells

Structure of Villus Epithelium

The epithelial lining of villi contains several structural features
which optimise its capacity to absorb digested materials:
Tight Junctions

-   Occluding associations between the plasma membrane of two adjacent
    cells, creating an impermeable barrier
-   They keep digestive fluids separated from tissues and maintain a
    concentration gradient by ensuring one-way movementÂ 

Microvilli

-   Microvilli borders significantly increase surface area of the plasma
    membrane (>100Ã—), allowing for more absorption to occur
-   The membrane will be embedded with immobilised digestive enzymes and
    channel proteins to assist in material uptakeÂ 

Mitochondria

-   Epithelial cells of intestinal villi will possess large numbers of
    mitochondria to provide ATP for active transport mechanisms
-   ATP may be required for primary active transport (against gradient),
    secondary active transport (co-transport) or pinocytosis

Pinocytotic Vesicles

-   Pinocytosis (â€˜cell-drinkingâ€™) is the non-specific uptake of
    fluids and dissolved solutes (a quick way to translocate in bulk)
-   These materials will be ingested via the breaking and reforming of
    the membrane and hence contained within a vesicle

RNA World Hypothesis

The RNA world hypothesis proposes that a world filled with RNA-based
life predates current DNA-based lifeforms

RNA has two key qualities that would have allowed it to function in this
manner:

RNA can self-replicate

-   RNA is able to store information in a sequence composed of four
    recurring nucleotides (similar to DNA)
-   Short sequences of RNA are able to be accurately duplicated to form
    identical RNA molecules

RNA can act as a catalyst

-   Modern cells use RNA catalysts (called ribozymes) to remove introns
    from mRNA and help synthesise new RNA molecules
-   In ribosomes, rRNA functions as the catalytic component and plays a
    pivotal role in peptide bond formation

RNA is the only molecule that is capable of both self-replication and
catalytic functioning, but has since beenÂ superseded:

-   DNA, through its superior chemical stability (double helical
    structure) has taken over as the data storage form
-   Protein, through its greater variability (20 amino acids as opposed
    to 4 nucleotide bases) has taken over as the catalytic form
-   RNA remains as a transitional form between DNA and protein,
    suggestive of its multi-faceted originsÂ

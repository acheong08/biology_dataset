Understanding:

â€¢ Â A clade is a group of organisms that have evolved from a common
ancestor

Â  Â Â 
Cladistics is a method of classifying organisms into groups of species
called clades (from GreekÂ â€˜klados' = branch)

-   Each clade consists of an ancestral organism and all of its
    evolutionary descendants
-   Members of a clade will possess common characteristics as a result
    of their shared evolutionary lineage

Clades can be organised according to branching diagrams (cladograms) in
order to show evolutionary relationships

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cladograms are tree diagrams that show the most probable sequence
of divergence in clades

Â  Â Â 
Cladograms are tree diagrams where each branch point represents the
splitting of two new groups from a common ancestor

-   Each branch point (node) represents a speciation event by which
    distinct species are formed via divergent evolution

Cladograms show the probable sequence of divergence and hence
demonstrate the likely evolutionary history (phylogeny) of a clade

-   The fewer the number of nodes between two groups the more closely
    related they are expected to be

Application:

â€¢ Â Cladograms including humans and other primates

Â  Â Â 
Cladograms can show evolutionary relationships and demonstrate how
recently two groups shared a common ancestry

-   As each node represents a point of divergence, closely related
    species will be separated by fewer nodes

According to a cladogram outlining the evolutionary history of humans
and other primates:

-   Humans, chimpanzees, gorillas,Â orangutansÂ and gibbons all belong
    to a common clade â€“ the Hominoids
-   The Hominoid clade forms part of a larger clade â€“ the Anthropoids
    â€“ which includes Old World and New World monkeysÂ

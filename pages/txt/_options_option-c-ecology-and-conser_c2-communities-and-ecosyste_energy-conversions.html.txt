Understanding:

â€¢ Â The percentage of ingested energy converted to biomass is
dependent upon the respiration rate

Â  Â Â 
Ecological production (or productivity) refers to the rate of generation
of biomass in an ecosystem

-   It is usually expressed in units of mass per area per time (e.g. kg
    m^(â€“2) day^(â€“1))

Biomass is the total dry weight of organic matter in organisms or
ecosystems

-   Biomass is essentially the entirety of all biologically produced
    organic matter (e.g. proteins, carbohydrates, etc.)

The percentage of energy that is converted into biomass is dependent
upon a number of factors:

-   Energy is lost as inedible materials â€“ such as bones, teeth and
    hair
-   Energy is lost via excretion of undigested and unabsorbed materials
-   Energy is lost as heat from cellular respiration (higher respiration
    rate results in more heat lost)

Primary Production

Primary production describes the production of chemical energy in
organic compounds byÂ producers

-   The main source of energy for primary production is sunlight, but a
    fraction may be driven by chemosynthesis byÂ lithotrophs

Primary production may be categorised as one of two types:

-   Gross primary productionÂ (GPP) is the amount of chemical energy as
    biomass that a producer creates in a given length of time
-   Net primary productionÂ (NPP) is the amount of chemical energy that
    is not consumed by respiration (NPP = GPP â€“ respiration)

Secondary Production

Secondary production describes the generation of biomass by
heterotrophic organisms (consumers)

-   This biomass generation is driven by the transfer of organic
    compounds between trophic levels via feeding
-   Secondary production may also be categorised according
    toÂ grossÂ (total) andÂ netÂ (usable) amounts of biomass

Practice Question

[question] The total solar energy received by a grassland is 5 x 10⁵ kJ
m^(â€“2) year^(â€“1).
The gross production is 4.35 x 10³ kJ m^(â€“2) year^(â€“1).
The net production of the grassland is 1.95 x 10³ kJ m^(â€“2)
year^(â€“1).
A: Calculate the percentage of solar energy converted into chemical
energy by photosynthesis.
B: Calculate the energy lost by plant respiration.

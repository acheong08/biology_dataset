â€¢ Â Implantation of the blastocyst in the endometrium is essential for
the continuation of pregnancy

Blastocyst Formation

Following the fusion of an egg and sperm (fertilization), an influx of
Ca²⁺ into the ova prompts the completion of meiosis II

-   The egg and sperm nuclei combine to form a diploid nuclei and the
    fertilized cell is now called a zygote

The zygote will undergo several mitotic divisions to form a solid ball
of cells called a morula

-   As the morula continues to divide, it undergoes differentiation and
    cavitation (cavity formation) to form a blastocystÂ 

A blastocyst is comprised of three distinct sections:

-   An inner cell mass (that will develop into the embryo)
-   A surrounding outer layer called the trophoblast (this will develop
    into the placenta)
-   A fluid filled cavity called the blastocoeleÂ

Implantation of Blastocyst

The final stage of early embryo development is the implantation of the
blastocyst into the endometrial lining of the uterus

-   The blastocyst breaches the jelly coat that was surrounding it and
    preventing its attachment to the endometrium
-   Digestive enzymes are released which degrade the endometrial lining,
    while autocrine hormones released from the blastocyst trigger its
    implantation into the uterine wall

Only once the blastocyst is embedded within the uterine wall can the
next stage of embryogenesis occur

-   The growing embryo will gain oxygen and nutrients from the
    endometrial tissue fluid, ensuring its continued development
-   The entire process (from fertilization to implantation) takes
    roughly 6 â€“ 8 days

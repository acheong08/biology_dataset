â€¢ Â Drawing the structure of primary xylem vessels in sections of
stems based on microscope images

Â  Â Â 
When drawing the structure of primary xylem vessels, it is important to
remember the following features:

-   Vessel elements should be drawn as a continuous tube (tracheids will
    consist of interlinking tapered cells)
-   The remnants of the fused end wall can be represented as indents
    (these forms perforated end plates)
-   The xylem wall should contain gaps (pits), which enable the exchange
    of water molecules
-   Lignin can be represented by either a spiral (coiled) or annular
    (rings) arrangement

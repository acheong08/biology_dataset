[doctor]

Interphase is an active period in the cell cycle when many metabolic
reations occur

Many events need to occur in interphase to prepare the cell for
successful division

These key processes include:

-   DNA replication â€“ DNA is copied during the S phase of interphase
-   Organelle duplication â€“ Organelles must be duplicated for twin
    daughter cells
-   Cell growth â€“ Cytoplasmic volume must increase prior to division
-   Transcription / translation â€“ Key proteins and enzymes must be
    synthesised
-   Obtain nutrients â€“ Vital cellular materials must be present before
    division
-   Respiration (cellular) â€“ ATP production is needed to drive the
    division process

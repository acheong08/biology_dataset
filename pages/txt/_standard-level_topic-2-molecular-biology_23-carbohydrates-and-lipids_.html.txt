2.3 Â Carbohydrates and Lipids

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
are used to supply and store energy

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Monosaccharide monomers are linked together by condensation
    reactions to form disaccharides and polysaccharide polymers
-   Fatty acids can be saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated
-   Unsaturated fatty acids can be cis or trans isomers
-   Triglycerides are formed by condensation from three fatty acids and
    one glycerol

Applications:

-   Structure and function of cellulose and starch in plants and
    glycogen in humans
-   Scientific evidence for health risks of trans fats and saturated
    fatty acids
-   Lipids are more suitable for long-term energy storage in humans than
    carbohydrates
-   Evaluation of evidence and the methods used to obtain the evidence
    for health claims made about lipids

Skills:

-   Use of molecular visualisation software to compare cellulose, starch
    and glycogen
-   Determination of body mass index by calculation or use of a nomogram

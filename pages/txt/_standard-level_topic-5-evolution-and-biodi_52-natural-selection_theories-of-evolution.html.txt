Theories of Evolution

Evolutionary theories began emerging in the 1800â€™s as new geological
and biological discoveries reformed existing knowledge

-   Previously, the dominant paradigm had described theÂ â€˜fixityâ€™ of
    species â€“ immutable and unchanging (man was always man)

LamarckÂ 

-   Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a French scientist, proposed that species
    changed as a result of the habitual use or disuse of a feature
-   Excessive use would cause a feature to develop, while continued
    disuse would cause it to atrophy (similar to muscle growth)
-   Lamarck proposed that these modified features could be passed on to
    successive generations, changing the species over time
-   Lamarckâ€™s theory however was essentially flawed â€“ cutting the
    tail off a rat does not produce tail-less offspring

Darwin

-   Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution was based on a combination of
    Lamarckian ideas and recent fossil discoveries
-   He theorised that species living today had been changed over time
    and stemmed from a single (or few) ancestral organisms
-   He noted that although populations have the capacity to grow
    uncontrollably, limiting natural factors will restrict this growth
-   Organisms which possess traits better suited to conditions would
    have an adaptive advantage and be more likely to reproduce
-   These traits would hence become more common within the population
    and the species would gradually change over time
-   Similar ideas were proposed at the same time by Alfred Wallace (he
    corresponded with Darwin but published separately)

Darwinâ€™s Theory of Evolution (Natural Selection)

Neo Darwinism

-   Darwin knew very little about the mechanisms of variation (i.e.
    mutations) or the biological basis for inheritance (i.e. meiosis)
-   Neo-Darwinism is the synthesis of Darwinian theory and modern
    genetics â€“ it combines:
    -   The works of Gregor Mendel in describing how traits are
        inherited (Mendelian inheritance)
    -   The works of James Watson and Francis Crick in elucidating the
        genetic basis of inheritance (DNA structure)

â€¢ Â The first cells must have arisen from non-living material

Â  Â Â 
The theory that living cells arose from non-living matter is known as
abiogenesis

This process is theorised to have occurred over four key stages:

-   There was non-living synthesis of simple organic molecules (from
    primordial inorganic molecules)
-   These simple organic molecules became assembled into more complex
    polymers
-   Certain polymers formed the capacity to self-replicate (enabling
    inheritance)
-   These molecules became packaged into membranes with an internal
    chemistry different from their surroundings (protobionts)

Miller-Urey Experiment

The non-living synthesis of simple organic molecules has been
demonstrated by the Miller-Urey experiment

Stanley Miller and Harold Urey recreated the postulated conditions of
pre-biotic Earth using a closed system of flasks and tubes

-   Water was boiled to vapour to reflect the high temperatures common
    to Earthâ€™s original conditions
-   The vapour was mixed with a variety of gases (including H₂, CH₄,
    NH₃) to create a reducing atmosphere (no oxygen)
-   This mixture was then exposed to an electrical discharge (simulating
    the effects of lightning as an energy source for reactions)
-   The mixture was then allowed to cool (concentrating components) and
    left for a period of ~1 week
-   After this time, the condensed mixture was analysed and found to
    contain traces of simple organic molecules

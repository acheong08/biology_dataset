Pleiotropy

Pleiotropy occurs when a single gene affects multiple traits â€“ hence
mutationsÂ will tend to beÂ severe and affect multiple systems

Pleiotropy can be observed in the multiple health issues arising from
sickle cell anaemia (mutation to the beta-globin gene)

-   The rapid breakdown of red blood cells causes anaemia, leading to
    increased lethargy and higher risks of infection
-   The clotting of sickle cells in vessels can cause heart attacks and
    brain damage (strokes and paralysis)
-   The accumulation of blood cells in specific organs can lead to loss
    of function (e.g. liver or splenic failure, kidney damage, etc.)

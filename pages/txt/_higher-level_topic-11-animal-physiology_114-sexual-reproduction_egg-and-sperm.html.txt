functions

Â  Â Â 
The male and female reproductive gametes (sperm and egg) have
specialised structures which reflect their functions

-   The male gamete (sperm) is small and motile and only contributes the
    maleâ€™s haploid nucleus to the zygote
-   The female gamete (egg) is large and non-motile and contributes all
    the organelles and cytoplasm to the zygote

Sperm

-   A typical human spermatozoa can be divided into three sections â€“
    head,Â mid-piece and tailÂ 
-   The head region contains three structures â€“ a haploid nucleus, an
    acrosome cap and paired centrioles
    -   The haploid nucleus contains the paternal DNA (this will combine
        with maternal DNA if fertilisation is successful)
    -   The acrosome cap contains hydrolytic enzymes which help the
        sperm to penetrate the jelly coat of the egg
    -   The centrioles are needed by a zygote in order to divide (egg
        cells expel their centrioles within their polar bodies)
-   TheÂ mid-piece contains high numbers of mitochondria which provide
    the energy (ATP) needed for the tail to move
-   The tail (flagellum) is composed of a microtubule structure called
    the axoneme, which bends to facilitate movement

Egg

-   A typical egg cell is surrounded by two distinct layers â€“
    theÂ zone pellucida (jelly coat) and coronaÂ radiata
    -   Â The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein matrix which acts as a
        barrier to sperm entry
    -   The corona radiata is an external layer of follicular cells
        which provide support and nourishment to the egg cell
-   Within the egg cell are numerous cortical granules, which release
    their contents upon fertilisation to prevent polyspermy
-   Although diagrams of egg cells commonly include a haploid nucleus,
    no nucleus will form within the egg until after fertilisation has
    occurred (the egg cell is arrested in metaphase II until it becomes
    fertilised by a sperm)

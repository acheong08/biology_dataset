Â  Â Â 
Excretion is the removal from the body of the waste products of
metabolic activity

-   Defecation is not considered part of excretion as faeces are
    undigested food remnants and not metabolic waste products

There are two key functions that an excretory system performs:

-   Removes nitrogenous wastes that may be toxic to the body in large
    concentrations
-   Removes excess water to maintain a suitable osmolarity within the
    tissues and cells

Removing Nitrogenous Waste

Nitrogenous wastes are produced from the breakdown of
nitrogen-containing compounds like amino acids and nucleotides

-   Nitrogenous wastes are toxic to the organism and hence excess levels
    must be eliminated from the body
-   The type of nitrogenous waste in animals is correlated with the
    evolutionary history of the animal and the habitat

Most aquatic animals eliminate their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia (NH₃)

-   Ammonia is highly toxic but also very water soluble and hence can be
    effectively flushed by animals in aquatic habitats

Terrestrial animals have less access to water and hence must package
nitrogenous waste in less toxic forms

-   Mammals eliminate their nitrogenous wastes as urea, which is less
    toxic and hence can be stored at higher concentrations
-   Reptiles and birds eliminate wastes as uric acid, which requires
    more energy to make but is relatively non-toxic and requires even
    less water to flush (it is eliminated as a semi-solid paste)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â All animals are either osmoregulators or osmoconformers

Â  Â Â 
Removing Excess Water

Water levels within an organism are constantly changing as a result of
metabolic activity

-   Water is produced via condensation reactions (anabolism) and is
    consumed during hydrolysis reactions (catabolism)
-   The concentration of water within cells (osmolarity) will impact
    tissue viability (i.e. governs osmotic pressure within cells)

Animals may be either osmoconformers orÂ osmoregulators according to how
they manage their internal osmotic conditions:

-   Osmoconformers maintain internal conditions that are equal to the
    osmolarity of their environment
-   Osmoregulators keep their bodyâ€™s osmolarity constant, regardless
    of environmental conditions

By matching internal osmotic conditions to the environment,
osmoconformers minimise water movement in and out of cells

-   Less energy is used to maintain internal osmotic conditions within
    an osmoconformer

While osmoregulation is a more energy-intensive process, it ensures
internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled

-   Osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions whereas
    osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions

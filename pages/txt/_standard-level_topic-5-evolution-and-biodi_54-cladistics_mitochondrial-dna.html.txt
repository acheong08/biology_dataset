Mitochondrial DNA

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an important tool for tracing evolutionary
relationshipsÂ within a species

Mitochondrial DNA offers several benefits over nuclear DNA when
determining phylogenetic pathways, including:

-   Maternal inheritance â€“ mtDNA is inherited from the mother only,
    providing a much more direct genetic lineage
-   No recombination â€“ As mtDNA is passed from the mother, no
    recombination occurs, maintaining sequence fidelity
-   Higher mutation rate â€“ Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen
    species, which cause sequences to mutate at a higher rate
-   High copy number â€“ As every cell has mitochondria, large amounts
    of mtDNA can be gathered for sequencing

Mitochondrial DNA is ideal for comparing organisms within a species or
those who have diverged recently (> 20 million years)

-   Evidence from mtDNA has been used to divide the human population
    into distinct haplogroups
-   Humans can trace their origins back to one of seven
    super-haplogroups originating from an original 'Mitochondrial Eveâ€™

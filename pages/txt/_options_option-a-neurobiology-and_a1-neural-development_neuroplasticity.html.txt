Understanding:

â€¢ Â The plasticity of the nervous system allows it to change with
experience

Â  Â Â 
Neuroplasticity describes the capacity for the nervous system to change
and rewire its synaptic connections

-   Neuroplasticity enables individuals to reinforce certain connections
    (learning) or circumvent damaged regions

This adaptive response is achieved via two primary mechanisms â€“
rerouting and sprouting

-   Rerouting involves creating re-establishing an existing nervous
    connection via an alternative neural pathway
-   Sprouting involves the growth of new axon or dendrite fibres to
    enable new neural connections to be formed

This reorganisation of the architecture of the nervous system enables
memory retention and learning

â€¢ Â Conversion ratio in sustainable food production practices

Â  Â Â 
Feed conversion ratios measure the efficiency of an animal in converting
the food provided (feed mass) into a desired output

-   Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) = mass of feed Ã· mass of desired output
-   The lower the feed conversion ratio the more efficient the method of
    food production

A low feed conversion ratio is obtained by minimising the potential
losses of energy for the animal stock:

-   Restricting animal movement (e.g. battery hens) will reduce energy
    lost to cell respiration
-   Optimising feeding practices so that food is ingested and digested
    more effectively
-   Slaughtering animals at a young age (older animals tend to grow more
    slowly and have a higher FCR)

While more efficient food production practices lower costs, there are a
number of potential ethical issues that may be involved

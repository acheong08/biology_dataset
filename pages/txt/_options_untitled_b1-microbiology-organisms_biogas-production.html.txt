Application:

â€¢ Â Biogas is produced by bacteria and archaeans from organic matter
in fermenters

Â  Â Â 
Biogas is a clean and renewable fuel source produced by the breakdown of
organic matter by particular microorganisms

-   Biogas is primarily composed of methane, carbon dioxide and water
    vapour
-   Biogas can be produced from a variety of sources of biomass â€“
    including manure, sewage, agricultural waste or food scraps

The production of biogas involves two groups of microorganisms â€“
eubacteria and archaeans (methanogens)

-   Bacteria first convert the organic material into organic acids and
    alcohol
-   Other bacteria convert these products into acetate, carbon dioxide
    and hydrogen gas
-   Archaeans then create methane, either via breakdown of acetate or
    via a reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen gasÂ 

The production of biogas can occur in small-scale fermenters under
anaerobic conditions

-   The fermenter needs to be maintained at a neutral pH (~ 7) and
    constant temperature (~ 35ÂºC) to maximise yield

Skill:

â€¢ Â Production of biogas in a small-scale fermenter

Â  Â Â 
Small-scale biogas fermenters are air-tight containers that
anaerobically break down kitchen and garden wastes to produce biogas

-   The fermentation process produces a digested slurry (digestate),
    which can be used as a fertilizer
-   The biogas forms within the slurry and collects at the top of the
    chamber, where it can be transported for use via an outlet

The main design elements of a biogas fermenters are an air-tight
chamber, an inlet and a vessel for biogas collection

-   A small-scale fermenter can also be directly linked to toilets for
    the additional treatment of human excreta
-   Small-scale biogas fermenters are typically used by households or
    communities in rural areas as a supplementary fuel source

Electrocardiography

Heart function can be diagnostically assessed by measuring the
electrical activity of the heart with each contraction

-   Activity is measured using a machine called an electrocardiograph to
    generate data called an electrocardiogram
    -   Hint: Â In a similar fashion, you use aÂ telegraph (machine) to
        send a telegram (data)

Each normal heart beat should follow the same sequence of electrical
events:

-   The P wave represents depolarisation of the atria in response to
    signalling from the sinoatrial node (i.e. atrial contraction)
-   The QRS complex represents depolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular contraction), triggered by signals from the AV node
-   The T wave represents repolarisation of the ventricles (i.e.
    ventricular relaxation) and the completion of a standard heart beat
-   Between these periods of electrical activity are intervals allowing
    for blood flow (PR interval and ST segment)

Examples of Heart Conditions

Data generated via electrocardiography can be used to identify a variety
of heart conditions, including:

-   Tachycardia (elevated resting heart rate = >120Â bpm) and
    bradycardia (depressed resting heart rate = < 40 bpm)
-   Arrhythmias (irregular heart beats that are so common in young
    people that it is not technically considered a disease)
-   Fibrillations (unsynchronised contractions of either atria or
    ventricles leading to dangerously spasmodic heart activity)

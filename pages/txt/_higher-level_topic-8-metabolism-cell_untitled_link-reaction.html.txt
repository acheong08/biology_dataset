Understanding:

â€¢ Â In aerobic cell respiration pyruvate is decarboxylated and
oxidised, and converted into acetyl compound and

Â  Â Â attached to coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A in the link
reaction

Â  Â Â 
The first stage of aerobic respiration is the link reaction, which
transports pyruvate into the mitochondria

-   Aerobic respiration uses available oxygen to further oxidise the
    sugar molecule for a greater yield of ATP

The link reaction is named thus because it links the products of
glycolysis with the aerobic processes of the mitochondria

-   Pyruvate is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial
    matrix by carrier proteins on the mitochondrial membrane
-   The pyruvate loses a carbon atom (decarboxylation), which forms a
    carbon dioxide molecule
-   The 2C compound then forms an acetyl group when it loses hydrogen
    atoms via oxidation (NAD⁺ is reduced to NADH + H⁺)
-   The acetyl compound then combines with coenzyme A to form acetyl
    coenzyme A (acetyl CoA)

As glycolysis splits glucose into two pyruvate molecules, the link
reaction occurs twice per molecule of glucose

-   Per glucose molecule, the link reaction produces acetyl CoA (Ã—2),
    NADH + H⁺ (Ã—2) and CO₂ (Ã—2)

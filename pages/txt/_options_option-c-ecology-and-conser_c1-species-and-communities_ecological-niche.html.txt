Understanding:

â€¢ Â Each species plays a unique role within a community because of the
unique combination of its spatial habitat

Â  Â Â and interactions with other species

Â  Â Â 
An ecological niche describes the functional position and role of an
organism within its environment

-   It consists of all physical and biological conditions which
    determine the organismâ€™s survival and reproductive prospects

An ecological niche will be comprised of various components, including:

-   The habitat in which an organism lives
-   The activity patterns of the organism (e.g. periods of time during
    which it is active)
-   The resources it obtains from the environment (e.g. food sources,
    territorial boundaries, etc.)
-   The interactions that occur with other species in the community
    (e.g. predator prey relationships, competition, etc.)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Two species cannot survive indefinitely in the same habitat if
their niches are identical

Â  Â Â 
If two distinct species share an identical niche, there will be
interspecific competition for available space and resources

-   This competition between the two species will result in the fitness
    of one being lowered by the presence of the other
-   Inevitably, the less well-adapted species will struggle to survive
    and reproduce â€“ it will eventually be eliminated from the niche

Interspecific competition within a shared niche will typically prompt
one of two responses:

-   Competitive exclusion â€“ One species uses the resources more
    efficiently, driving the other species to local extinction
-   Resource partitioning â€“ Both species alter their use of the
    habitat to divide resources between them (i.e. niche separation)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of a data set that illustrates the distinction between
fundamental and realized niche

Â  Â Â 
Some species may not be able to occupy their entire niche due to the
presence or absence of other species

-   Hence a species may occupy a smaller subset of their niche than is
    theoretically possible (fundamental vs realised niche)

Fundamental Niche

A fundamental niche is the entire set of conditions under which an
organism can survive and reproduce (where it could live)

-   It is the theoretical habitat and may not be fully occupied due to
    the presence of competing species
-   In a rocky shore environment, the Chthalamus barnacle can
    potentially occupy the entire rocky shore (if in isolation)

Realised Niche

A realised niche is the set of conditions used by an organism after
including interactions with other species (where it does live)

-   It is the actual habitat that is completely occupied by an organism
    in the presence of competing species
-   In a rocky shore environment, theÂ Chthalamus barnacle only occupies
    regions where the Semibalanus barnacle is absent

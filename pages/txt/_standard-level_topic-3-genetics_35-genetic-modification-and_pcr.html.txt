Understanding:

â€¢ Â PCR can be used to amplify small amounts of DNA

Â  Â Â 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an artificial method of
replicating DNA under laboratory conditions

-   The PCR technique is used to amplify large quantities of a specific
    sequence of DNA from an initial minute sample
-   Each reaction cycle doubles the amount of DNA â€“ a standard PCR
    sequence of 30 cycles creates over 1 billion copies (2³⁰)

Stages of PCR

PCR occurs in a thermal cycler and uses variations in temperature to
control the replication process via three steps:

1.  DenaturationÂ â€“ DNA sample is heated to separate it into two
    single strandsÂ (~95ÂºC for 1 min)
2.  AnnealingÂ â€“ DNA primers attach to the 3â€™Â ends of the target
    sequence (~55ÂºC for 1 min)
3.  ElongationÂ â€“ A heat-tolerant DNA polymerase (Taq) binds to the
    primer and copies the strand (~72ÂºC for 2 min)

Once large quantities of DNA have been created, other laboratory
techniques are used to isolate and manipulate the sequences

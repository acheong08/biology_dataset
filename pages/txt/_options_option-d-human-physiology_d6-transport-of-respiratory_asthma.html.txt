Asthma

Asthma is a common, chronic inflammation of the airways to the lungs
(i.e. bronchi and bronchioles)

-   Inflammation leads to swelling and mucus production, resulting in
    reduced airflow andÂ bronchospasm
-   During an acute asthma attack, constriction of the bronchi smooth
    muscle may cause significant airflow obstruction
-   Common symptoms of an asthma attack include shortness of breath,
    chest tightness, wheezing and coughing
-   Severe cases of asthma may be life threatening if left untreated

Asthma may be caused by a number of environmental triggers, including:

-   Cold air
-   Exercise (increases respiratory rate)

â€¢ Â Causes and treatments of emphysema

Â  Â Â 
Emphysema is a lung condition whereby the walls of the alveoli lose
their elasticity due to damage to the alveolar walls

-   The loss of elasticity results in the abnormal enlargement of the
    alveoli, leading to a lower total surface area for gas exchange
-   The degradation of the alveolar walls can cause holes to develop and
    alveoli to merge into huge air spaces (pulmonaryÂ bullae)

Causes

The major cause of emphysema isÂ smoking, as the chemical irritants in
cigarette smoke damage the alveolar walls

-   The damage to lung tissue leads to the recruitment of phagocytes to
    the region, which produce an enzyme called elastase
-   This elastase, released as part of an inflammatory response, breaks
    down the elastic fibres in the alveolar wall
-   A small proportion of emphysema cases are due to a hereditary
    deficiency in this enzyme inhibitor due to a gene mutation

Treatments

There is no current cure for emphysema, but treaments are available to
relieve symptoms and delay disease progression

-   Bronchodilators are commonly used to relax the bronchiolar muscles
    and improve airflow
-   Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammatory response that breaks
    down the elastic fibres in the alveolar wall
-   Elastase activity can be blocked by an enzyme inhibitor
    (Î±-1-antitrypsin), provided elastase concentrations are not too
    high
-   Oxygen supplementation will be required in the later stages of the
    disease to ensure adequate oxygen intake
-   In certain cases, surgery and alternative medicines have helped to
    decrease the severity of symptoms

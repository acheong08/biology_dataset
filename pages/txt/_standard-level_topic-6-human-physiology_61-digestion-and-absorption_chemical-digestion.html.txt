Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes digest most macromolecules in food into monomers in the
small intestine

Â  Â Â 
Food can be digested by a combination of two methods â€“ mechanical
digestion and chemical digestion

-   InÂ chemicalÂ digestion, food is broken down by the action of
    chemical agents (such as enzymes, acids and bile)

Stomach Acids

-   The stomach contains gastric glands which release digestive acids to
    create a low pH environment (pH ~2)
-   The acidic environment functions to denature proteins and other
    macromolecules, aiding in their overall digestion
-   The stomach epithelium contains a mucous membrane which prevents the
    acids from damaging the gastric lining
-   The pancreas releases alkaline compounds (e.g. bicarbonate ions),
    which neutralise the acids as they enter the intestineÂ 

Bile

-   The liver produces a fluid called bile which is stored and
    concentrated within the gall bladder prior to release into the
    intestine
-   Bile contains bile salts which interact with fat globules and divide
    them into smaller droplets (emulsification)
-   The emulsification of fats increases the total surface area
    available for enzyme activity (lipase)

Enzymes

-   Enzymes are biological catalysts which speed up the rate of a
    chemical reaction (i.e. digestion) by lowering activation energy
-   Enzymes allow digestive processes to therefore occur at body
    temperatures and at sufficient speeds for survival requirements
-   Enzymes are specific for a substrate and so can allow digestion of
    certain molecules to occur independently in distinct locations

Examples of Digestive Enzymes

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The pancreas secretes enzymes into the lumen of the small
intestine

Â  Â Â 
Digestive enzymes are secreted predominantly by the pancreas, although
other organs also contribute (salivary gland, stomach)

-   The type of enzyme secreted and location of secretion depends on the
    specific macromolecule required for hydrolysis

Carbohydrates

-   Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth with the release of
    amylase from the salivary glands (amylase = starch digestion)
-   Amylase is also secreted by the pancreas in order to continue
    carbohydrate digestion within the small intestine
-   Enzymes for disaccharide hydrolysis are often immobilised on the
    epithelial lining of the small intestine, near channel proteins
-   Humans do not possess an enzyme capable of digesting cellulose
    (cellulase) and hence it passes through the body undigested

Proteins

-   Protein digestion begins in the stomach with the release of
    proteases that function optimally in an acidic pH (e.g. pepsin = pH
    2)
-   Smaller polypeptide chains enter the small intestine where they are
    broken down by endopeptidases released by the pancreas
-   These endopeptidases work optimally in neutral environments (pH ~ 7)
    as the pancreas neutralises the acids in the intestine

Lipids

-   Lipid breakdown occurs in the intestines, beginning with
    emulsification of fat globules by bile released from the gall
    bladder
-   The smaller fat droplets are then digested by lipases released from
    the pancreas

Nucleic Acids

-   The pancreas also releases nucleases which digest nucleic acids
    (DNA, RNA) into smaller nucleosides

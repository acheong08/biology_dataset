during the cardiac cycle

The cardiac cycle describes the series of events that take place in the
heart over the duration of a single heart beat

-   It is comprised of a period of contraction (systole) and relaxation
    (diastole)

Systole

-   Blood returning to the heart will flow into the atria and ventricles
    as the pressure in them is lower (due to low volume of blood)
-   When ventricles are ~70% full, atria will contract (atrial systole),
    increasing pressure in the atria and forcing blood into ventricles
-   As ventricles contract, ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure
    and AV valves close to preventÂ back flow (first heart sound)
-   With both sets of heart valves closed, pressure rapidly builds in
    the contracting ventricles (isovolumetric contraction)
-   When ventricular pressure exceeds blood pressure in the aorta, the
    aortic valve opens and blood is released into the aorta

Diastole

-   As blood exits the ventricle and travels down the aorta, ventricular
    pressure fallsÂ 
-   When ventricular pressure drops below aortic pressure, the aortic
    valve closes to preventÂ back flow (second heart sound)
-   When the ventricular pressure drops below the atrial pressure, the
    AV valve opens and blood can flow from atria to ventricle
-   Throughout the cycle, aortic pressure remains quite high as muscle
    and elastic fibres in the artery wall maintain blood pressure

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ingestion of pathogens by phagocytic white blood cells gives
non-specific immunity to disease

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ second line of defenceÂ against infectious disease is the innate
immune system, which is non-specific in its response

-   A principle component of this line of defence are phagocytic white
    blood cells that engulf and digest foreign bodies
-   Other components of the innate immune system include inflammation,
    fever and antimicrobial chemicals (complement proteins)

The innate immune system has two key properties:

-   It does not differentiate between different types of pathogens
    (non-specific)Â 
-   It responds to an infection the same way every time (non-adaptive)

Phagocytes

Phagocytosis is the process by which solid materials (such as pathogens)
are ingested by a cell (i.e. cellÂ â€˜eatingâ€™ via endocytosis)

-   Phagocytic leukocytes circulate in the blood and move into the body
    tissue (extravasation) in response to infection
-   Damaged tissues release chemicals (e.g. histamine) which draw white
    blood cells to the site of infection (via chemotaxis)
-   Pathogens are engulfed when cellular extensions (pseudopodia)
    surround the pathogen and then fuse to form an internal vesicle
-   The vesicle is then fused to a lysosome (forming a phagolysosome)
    and the pathogen is digested
-   Pathogen fragments (antigens) may be presented on the surface of the
    phagocyte in order to stimulate the third line of defence

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The contraction of circular and longitudinal muscle of the small
intestine mixes food with enzymes and moves it

Â  Â Â along the gut

Â  Â Â 
Food can be digested by a combination of two methods â€“ mechanical
digestion and chemical digestion

-   In mechanical digestion, food is physically broken down into smaller
    fragments via the acts of chewing (mouth), churning (stomach) and
    segmentation (small intestine)

Mechanical Digestion

Chewing (Mouth)

-   Food is initially broken down in the mouth by the grinding action of
    teeth (chewing or mastication)
-   The tongue pushes the food towards the back of the throat, where it
    travels down the esophagus as a bolus
-   The epiglottis prevents the bolus from entering the trachea, while
    the uvula prevents the bolus from entering the nasal cavity

Churning (Stomach)

-   The stomach lining contains muscles which physically squeeze and mix
    the food with strong digestive juices ('churningâ€™)
-   Food is digested within the stomach for several hours and is turned
    into a creamy paste called chyme
-   Eventually the chyme enters the small intestine (duodenum) where
    absorption will occur

Movement of Food

Peristalsis

-   Peristalsis is the principal mechanism of movement in the
    oesophagus, although it also occurs in both the stomach and gut
-   Continuous segments of longitudinal smooth muscle rhythmically
    contract and relax
-   Food is moved unidirectionally along the alimentary canal in a
    caudal direction (mouth to anus)

Segmentation

-   Segmentation involves the contraction and relaxation of non-adjacent
    segments of circular smooth muscle in the intestines
-   Segmentation contractions move chyme in both directions, allowing
    for a greater mixing of food with digestive juices
-   While segmentation helps to physically digest food particles, its
    bidirectional propulsion of chyme can slow overall movementÂ

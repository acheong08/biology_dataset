The pH Scale

pH stands forÂ theÂ â€˜power of hydrogenâ€™Â and represents the
concentration of hydrogen ions in a water-based solution

-   pH is expressed on a logarithmic scale, whereby pH = â€“log₁₀c Â (c
    = concentration of H⁺ in moles per litre)Â 

The pH scale typically ranges from 0 â€“ 14 and measures how acidic or
basic a substance is

-   Substances with a pH less than 7 are acidic and will donate hydrogen
    ions (i.e. high H⁺ concentration)
-   Substances with a pH greater than 7 are basic / alkaline and will
    accept hydrogen ions (i.e. high OH^(â€“) concentration)
-   Substances with a pH of 7 are neutral (there is an equal number of
    H⁺ and OH^(â€“) ions)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Speciation can occur abruptly

Â  Â Â 
Evolution occurs both within a species (microevolution) and across the
species barrier (macroevolution = speciation)

-   Evolution viaÂ speciation may occur by one of two alternative
    models: phyletic gradualism or punctuated equilibrium

Phyletic Gradualism

According to this model, speciation generally occurs uniformly, via the
steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages

-   In this view, speciation is seen as a smooth and continuous process
    (big changes result from many cumulative small changes)
-   This view is supported by the fossil record of the horse, with many
    intermediate forms connecting the ancestral species to the modern
    equivalent

[phyletic gradualism]

Punctuated Equilibrium

According to this model, species remain stable for long periods before
undergoing abrupt and rapid change (speciation)Â 

-   In this view, speciation is seen as a periodic process (big changes
    occur suddenly, followed by long periods of no change)
-   This view is supported by the general lack of transitional fossils
    for most species â€“ however such absences could also be explained
    by the relatively rare and irregular conditions required for
    fossilisation

â€¢ Â Drawing of the fluid-mosaic model

Â  Â Â 
Cell membranes are represented according to a fluid-mosaic model, due to
the fact that they are:

-   Fluid â€“ the phospholipid bilayer is viscous and individual
    phospholipids can move position
-   Mosaic â€“ the phospholipid bilayer is embedded with proteins,
    resulting in a mosaic of components

Structure of the Plasma Membrane (Fluid-Mosaic)

[fluid-mosaic 2d]

Components of the Plasma Membrane

Phospholipids â€“ Form a bilayer with phosphate heads facing outwards
and fatty acid tails facing inwards

Cholesterol â€“ Found in animal cell membranes and functions to improve
stability and reduce fluidity

Proteins â€“ May be either integral (transmembrane) or peripheral and
serve a variety of roles

â€¢ Â Analysis of electron micrographs to find the state of contraction
of muscle fibres

Â  Â Â 
The arrangement of myofilaments within a sarcomere give a skeletal
muscle fibre a striated appearance

-   A sarcomere has a central darker region (A band) where actin and
    myosin filaments overlap
-   A sarcomere has peripheral lighter regions (I bands) where actin is
    present, but not myosin

When muscle fibres contract, actin filaments slide along the myosin,
reducing the length of the lighter I bands

-   The movement of the actin filaments also reduces the width of the H
    zone, however the length of A bands do not change

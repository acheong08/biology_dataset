Understanding:

â€¢ Â Water molecules are polar and hydrogen bonds form between them

Â  Â Â 
Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to an oxygen
atom (molecular formula = H₂O)

While this covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons, they are
not shared equally between the atoms

-   Oxygen (due to having a higher electronegativity) attracts the
    electrons more stronglyÂ 
-   The shared electrons orbit closer to the oxygen atom than the
    hydrogen atoms resulting in polarity

[water structure]

Water is described as being polar because it has a slight charge
difference across the different poles of the molecule

-   The oxygen atom is slightly negative (Î´^(â€“)) while the hydrogen
    atoms are slightly positiveÂ (Î´⁺)

This charge difference across the molecule (dipole) allows water to form
weak associations with other polar moleculesÂ 

-   The slightly negative polesÂ (Î´^(â€“))Â will attract the slightly
    positive polesÂ (Î´⁺)Â of other molecules, and vice versa

When aÂ Î´⁺Â hydrogen atom is attracted to aÂ Î´^(â€“)Â fluorine, oxygen
or nitrogen atom of another molecule, it forms a hydrogen bond

-   Hydrogen bonds are relatively stronger than other polar associations
    due to the high electronegativity of F, O and N

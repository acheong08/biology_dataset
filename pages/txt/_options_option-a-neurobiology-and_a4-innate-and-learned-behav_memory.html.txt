Understanding:

â€¢ Â Memory is the process of encoding, storing and accessing
information

Â  Â Â 
Learned behaviour is modified by experiences and thus requires memory to
recall and process this information

-   If we could not remember past events, we couldnâ€™t adapt our
    behaviour to new situations

Memory is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded,
stored and retrieved

-   Encoding involves converting information into a form that can be
    stored (e.g. visual cues, sounds, semantics)
-   Accessing involves the retrieval of stored information to be
    actively used in cognitive processes

Information can be stored as a short term memory (short recall duration)
or long term memory (indefinite recall period)

-   Short term memories can be converted to long term via the repetitive
    recall and consolidation of the information
-   Information that is not stored as a memory will be forgotten and
    will have to be re-learned

Many parts of the brain are involved in memory â€“ including the
prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus

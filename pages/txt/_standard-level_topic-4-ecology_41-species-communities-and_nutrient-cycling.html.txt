Understanding:

â€¢ Â The supply of inorganic nutrients is maintained by nutrient
cycling

Â  Â Â 
Nutrients refer to the material required by an organism, and include
elements such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus

-   The supply of inorganic nutrients on Earth is finite â€“ new
    elements cannot simply be created and so are in limited supply

Hence chemical elements are constantly recycled after they are used:

-   Autotrophs obtain inorganic nutrients from the air, water and soil
    and convert them into organic compounds
-   Heterotrophs ingest these organic compounds and use them for growth
    and respiration, releasing inorganic byproducts
-   When organisms die, saprotrophs decompose the remains and free
    inorganic materials into the soil
-   The return of inorganic nutrients to the soil ensures the continual
    supply of raw materials for the autotrophsÂ

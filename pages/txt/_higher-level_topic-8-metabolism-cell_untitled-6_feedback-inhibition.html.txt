Understanding:

â€¢ Â Metabolic pathways can be controlled by end-product inhibition

Â  Â Â 
End-product inhibition (or feedback inhibition) is a form of negative
feedback by which metabolic pathways can be controlled

-   In end-product inhibition, the final product in a series of
    reactions inhibits an enzyme from an earlier step in the sequence
-   The product binds to an allosteric site and temporarily inactivates
    the enzyme (via non-competitive inhibition)
-   As the enzyme can no longer function, the reaction sequence is
    halted and the rate of product formation is decreased

End-product inhibition functions to ensure levels of an essential
product are always tightly regulated

-   If product levels build up, the product inhibits the reaction
    pathway and hence decreases the rate of further product formation
-   If product levels drop, the reaction pathway will proceed unhindered
    and the rate of product formation will increase

Application:

â€¢ Â End-product inhibition of the pathway that converts threonine to
isoleucine

Â  Â Â 
Isoleucine is an essential amino acid, meaning it is not synthesised by
the body in humans (and hence must be ingested)

-   Food sources rich in isoleucine include eggs, seaweed, fish, cheese,
    chicken and lamb

In plants and bacteria, isoleucine may be synthesised from threonine in
a five-step reaction pathway

-   In the first step of this process, threonine is converted into an
    intermediate compound by an enzyme (threonine deaminase)
-   Isoleucine can bind to an allosteric site on this enzyme and
    function as a non-competitive inhibitor

As excess production of isoleucine inhibits further synthesis, it
functions as an example of end-product inhibition

-   This feedback inhibition ensures that isoleucine production does not
    cannibalise available stocks of threonine

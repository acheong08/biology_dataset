Application:

â€¢ Â Migratory behaviours in blackcaps as an example of the genetic
basis of behaviour and its change by

Â  Â Â natural selection

Â  Â Â 
The blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) exhibits behavioural variation in its
seasonal migratory patterns

-   This behaviour is genetically predetermined and not learned (i.e. it
    is instinctive / innate)

Genetic Basis of Migratory Behaviours

The migratory behaviours in blackcaps has been demonstrated to have a
genetic basis via a number of experiments

-   Chicks raised in isolation will follow the migratory routes of their
    parents (hence it is an innate trait andÂ notÂ learned)
-   Hybrid chicks of parents with different migration routes will
    migrate in a direction between the two parental directions
    -   This suggests heterozygote hybrids exhibit a combination of the
        migratory tendencies from each homozygous parent

Natural Selection of Migratory Behaviours

Blackcaps occupy summer breeding grounds in Germany, but migrate to
different locations during the winter months

-   Historically, most birds migrated south to Spain in the winter, with
    a minority migrating west to the UK
-   Spain is further away but has generally had a more temperate winter
    climate than the UK, improving reproductive success

With an increase in global temperatures, the migratory patterns of
blackcaps are changing due to natural selection

-   Blackcap populations in the UK are rising, as warmer temperatures
    are improving survival rates during the winter months
-   UK blackcaps are reproducing more, as the shorter migration allows
    them to select the best breeding territories in Germany

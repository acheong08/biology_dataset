â€¢ Â Comparison of allele frequencies of geographically isolated
populations

Â  Â Â 
Genetic drift is the change in the composition of a gene pool as a
result of chance or random events

-   It will occur faster and be more significant in smaller populations,
    where chance events have a bigger impact on the gene pool
-   Larger populations will be less affected by random events and
    maintain more stable allele frequencies with low genetic drift

Allele frequencies will change significantly when a large population is
reduced to a small population

-   Two mechanisms by which this population change may occur are via
    population bottlenecks and the founder effect

Population Bottlenecks

Population bottlenecks occur when an event reduces population size by an
order of magnitude (~ >50%)

-   These bottlenecks may result from natural occurrences (e.g. fires,
    floods, etc.) or be human induced (e.g. overhunting)
-   The surviving population has less genetic variability than before
    and will be subject to a higher level of genetic drift
-   As the surviving members begin to repopulate, the newly developing
    gene pool will be divergent to the original
-   Example:Â  Northern elephant seals have reduced genetic diversity
    compared with southern seals due to overhunting

Founder Effect

The founder effect occurs when a small group breaks away from a larger
population to colonise a new territory

-   As this population subset does not have the same degree of diversity
    as a larger population, it is subject to more genetic drift
-   Consequently, as this new colony increases in size, its gene pool
    will no longer be representative of the original gene pool
-   The founder effect differs from population bottlenecks in that the
    original population remains largely intact
-   Example: Â Certain Amish communities have a higher incidence of
    polydactyly because of inter-marriage within the community

Allele Frequency Comparisons

Allele frequencies represent the prevalence of a particular allele in a
population, as a proportion of all the alleles for that gene

-   Consequently, allele frequencies are either represented as a
    percentage or as a value from 0 to 1.0

Changes in allele frequency can reflect either random processes (genetic
drift) or differential processes (natural selection)

-   Population bottlenecks and the founder effect will exacerbate
    genetic differences between geographically isolated populations

Allele frequencies between populations can be compared using the Allele
Frequency Database (ALFRED)

How to Compare Allele Frequencies:

1.Â Â Go to the Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED)

2.Â Â Type a gene name into the search parameter

3.Â Â Choose a specific gene loci

4.Â Â Select a polymorphism

5.Â Â Choose a frequency display format

Examples:

-   SCL45A2 â€“ involved in human melanin production (allele frequency
    differs in Northern Europe)
-   ABO â€“ blood groups show regional variation (e.g. O blood more
    common in Africa)
-   LCT â€“ lactase is required for lactose tolerance (more common in
    Northern Europe / Africa)

Please Note:
SCL45 is one of a number of genes contributing to melanin production and
the pigmentation of human skin
A particular allele responsible for lighter pigmentation is more
frequent in Northern Europe

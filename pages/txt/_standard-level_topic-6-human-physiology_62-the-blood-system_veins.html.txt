Understanding:

â€¢ Â Veins collect blood at low pressure from the tissues of the body
and return it to the atria of the heart

Â  Â Â 
Structure and Function

The function of veins is to collect the blood from the tissues and
convey it at low pressure to the atria of the heart

To this end, veins have a specialised structure in order to accomplish
this task:

-   They have a very wide lumen (relative to wall thickness) to maximise
    blood flow for more effective return
-   They have a thin wall containing less muscle and elastic fibres as
    blood is flowing at a very low pressure (~ 5 â€“ 10 mmHg)
-   Because the pressure is low, veins possess valves to prevent
    backflow and stop the blood from pooling at the lowest extremities

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Valves in veins and the heart ensure circulation of blood by
preventingÂ backflow

Â  Â Â 
Flow of Blood

Blood is at very low pressure in the veins which can make it difficult
for the blood to move against the downward force of gravity

-   The veins contain numerous one-way valves in order to maintain the
    circulation of blood by preventingÂ backflow

Veins typically pass between skeletal muscle groups, which facilitate
venous blood flow via periodic contractions

-   When the skeletal muscles contract, they squeeze the vein and cause
    the blood to flow from the site of compression
-   Veins typically run parallel to arteries, and a similar effect can
    be caused by the rhythmic arterial bulge created by a pulse

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light most effectively and
reflects green light more than other colours

Â  Â Â 
Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in photosynthetic organisms that is
responsible for light absorption

-   When chlorophyll absorbs light, it releases electrons which are used
    to synthesise ATP (chemical energy)

There are a number of different chlorophyll molecules, each with their
own absorption spectra, however collectively:

-   Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the
    visible spectrum, followed by the red portion
-   Chlorophyll reflects light most strongly in the green portion of the
    visible spectrum (hence the green colour of leaves)

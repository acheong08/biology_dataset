â€¢ Â Analysis of evidence from electron microscopy that led to the
proposal of the Davson-Danielli modelÂ 

Â  Â Â 
The fluid-mosaic model was not the first scientifically accepted
paradigm to describe membrane structure

The first model that attempted to describe the position of proteins
within the bilayer was proposed by Hugh Davson and James Danielli in
1935

When viewed under a transmission electron microscope, membranes exhibit
a characteristic 'trilaminarâ€™Â appearance

-   Trilaminar = 3 layers (two dark outer layers and a lighter inner
    region)

Danielli and Davson proposed a model whereby two layers of protein
flanked a central phospholipid bilayer

-   The model was described as a 'lipo-protein sandwichâ€™, as the lipid
    layer was sandwiched between two protein layers
-   The dark segments seen under electron microscope were identified
    (wrongly) as representing the two protein layers

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of the falsification of the Davson-Danielli model that
led to the Singer-Nicolson modelÂ 

Â  Â Â 
There were a number of problems with the lipo-protein sandwich model
proposed by Davson and Danielli:

-   It assumed all membranes were of a uniform thickness and would have
    a constant lipid-protein ratioÂ 
-   It assumed all membranes would have symmetrical internal and
    external surfaces (i.e. not bifacial)
-   It did not account for the permeability of certain substances (did
    not recognise the need for hydrophilic pores)Â 
-   The temperatures at which membranes solidified did not correlate
    with those expected under the proposed modelÂ 

Falsification Evidence:

Membrane proteins were discovered to be insoluble in water (indicating
hydrophobic surfaces) and varied in size

-   Such proteins would not be able to form a uniform and continuous
    layer around the outer surface of a membrane

Fluorescent antibody tagging of membrane proteins showed they were
mobile and not fixed in place

-   Membrane proteins from two different cells were tagged with red and
    green fluorescent markers respectively
-   When the two cells were fused, the markers became mixed throughout
    the membrane of the fused cell
-   This demonstrated that the membrane proteins could move and did not
    form a static layer (as per Davson-Danielli)

Freeze fracturing was used to split open the membrane and revealed
irregular rough surfaces within the membraneÂ 

-   These rough surfaces were interpreted as beingÂ transmembrane
    proteins, demonstrating that proteins were not solely localised to
    the outside of the membrane structure

New Model:

In light of these limitations, a new model was proposed by Seymour
Singer and Garth Nicolson in 1972

According to this model, proteins were embedded within the lipid bilayer
rather than existing as separate layers

This model, known as the fluid-mosaic model, remains the model preferred
by scientists today (with refinements)

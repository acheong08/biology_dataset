Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nucleosomes help to regulate transcription in eukaryotes

Â  Â Â 
Eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to formÂ compact
nucleosomes

-   These histone proteins have protruding tails that determine how
    tightly the DNA is packaged

Modification of Histone Tails

Typically the histone tails have a positive charge and hence associate
tightly with the negatively charged DNA

-   Adding an acetyl group to the tail (acetylation) neutralises the
    charge, making DNA less tightly coiled and increasing transcription
-   Adding a methyl group to the tail (methylation) maintains the
    positive charge, making DNA more coiled and reducing transcription

Types of Chromatin

When DNA is supercoiled and not accessible for transcription, it exists
as condensed heterochromatin

When the DNA is loosely packed and therefore accessible to the
transcription machinery, it exists as euchromatin

-   Different cell types will have varying segments of DNA packaged as
    heterochromatin and euchromatin
-   Some segments of DNA may be permanently supercoiled, while other
    segments may change over the life cycle of the cell

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of changes in the DNA methylation patterns

Â  Â Â 
Direct methylation of DNA (as opposed to the histone tails) can also
affect gene expression patterns

-   Increased methylation of DNA decreases gene expression (by
    preventing the binding of transcription factors)
-   Consequently, genes that are not transcribed tend to exhibit more
    DNA methylation than genes that are actively transcribed

Epigenetics

Epigenetics is the study of changes in phenotype as a result of
variations in gene expression levelsÂ 

-   Epigenetic analysis shows that DNA methylation patterns may change
    over the course of a lifetime
-   It is influenced by heritability but is not genetically
    pre-determined (identical twins may have different DNA methylation
    patterns)
-   Different cell types in the same organism may have markedly
    different DNA methylation patterns
-   Environmental factors (e.g. diet, pathogen exposure, etc.) may
    influence the level of DNA methylation within cells

6.1 Â Digestion and Absorption

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The structure of the wall of the small intestine
allows it to move, digest and absorb food

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The contraction of circular and longitudinal muscle of the small
    intestine mixes the food with enzymes and moves it along the gut
-   Enzymes digest most macromolecules in food into monomers in the
    small intestine
-   The pancreas secretes enzymes into the lumen of the small intestine
-   Villi increase the surface area of epithelium over which absorption
    is carried out
-   Villi absorb monomers formed by digestion as well as mineral ions
    and vitamins
-   Different methods of membrane transport are required to absorb
    different nutrients

Applications:

-   Processes occurring in the small intestine that result in the
    digestion of starch and transport of the products of digestion to
    the liver
-   Use of dialysis tubing to model absorption of digested food in the
    intestine

Skills:

-   Production of an annotated diagram of the digestive system
-   Identification of tissue layers in transverse sections of the small
    intestine viewed with a microscope or in a micrograph

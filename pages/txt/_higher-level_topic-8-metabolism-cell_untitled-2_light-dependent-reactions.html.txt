Understanding:

â€¢ Â Absorption of light by photosystems generates excited electrons

â€¢ Â Transfer of excited electrons occurs between carriers in thylakoid
membranes

Â  Â Â 
The light dependent reactions use photosynthetic pigments (organised
into photosystems) to convert light energy into chemical energy
(specifically ATP and NADPH)
These reactions occur within specialised membrane discs within the
chloroplast called thylakoids and involve three steps:

-   Excitation of photosystems by light energy
-   Production of ATP via an electron transport chain
-   Reduction of NADP⁺ and the photolysis of water

Step 1: Â Excitation of Photosystems by Light Energy

-   Photosystems are groups of photosynthetic pigments (including
    chlorophyll) embedded within the thylakoid membrane
-   Photosystems are classed according to their maximal absorption
    wavelengths (PS I = 700 nm ; PS II = 680 nm)
-   When a photosystem absorbs light energy, delocalised electrons
    within the pigments become energised orÂ â€˜excited'
-   These excited electrons areÂ transferred to carrier molecules within
    the thylakoid membrane

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Excited electrons from Photosystem II are used to contribute to
generate a proton gradient

â€¢ Â ATP synthase in thylakoids generates ATP using the proton gradient

Â  Â  Â Â 
Step 2: Â Production of ATP via an Electron Transport Chain

-   Excited electrons from Photosystem II (P680) are transferred to an
    electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane
-   As the electrons are passed through the chain they lose energy,
    which is used to translocate H⁺ ions into the thylakoid
-   This build up of protons within the thylakoid creates an
    electrochemical gradient, or proton motive force
-   The H⁺ ions return to the stroma (along the proton gradient) via the
    transmembrane enzyme ATP synthase (chemiosmosis)
-   ATP synthase uses the passage of H⁺ ions to catalyse the synthesis
    of ATP (from ADP + Pi)
-   This process is called photophosphorylation â€“ as light provided
    the initial energy source for ATP production
-   The newly de-energised electrons from Photosystem II are taken up by
    Photosystem I

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Excited electrons from Photosystem I are used to reduce NADP

â€¢ Â Photolysis of water generates electrons for use in the light
dependent reactions

Â  Â  Â 
Step 3: Â Reduction of NADP+ and the Photolysis of Water

-   Excited electrons from Photosystem I may be transferred to a carrier
    molecule and used to reduce NADP⁺
-   This forms NADPH â€“ which is needed (in conjunction with ATP) for
    the light independent reactions
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem I are replaced by de-energised
    electrons from Photosystem II
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem II are replaced by electrons
    released from water via photolysis
-   Water is split by light energy into H⁺ ions (used in chemiosmosis)
    and oxygen (released as a by-product)

Overview of the Light Dependent Reactions

-   The light dependent reactions occur within the intermembrane space
    of the thylakoids
-   Chlorophyll in Photosystems I and II absorb light, which triggers
    the release of high energy electrons (photo activation)
-   Excited electrons from Photosystem II are transferred between
    carrier molecules in an electron transport chain
-   The electron transport chain translocates H⁺ ions from the stroma to
    within the thylakoid, creating a proton gradient
-   The protons are returned to theÂ stroma via ATP synthase, which uses
    their passage (via chemiosmosis) to synthesise ATP
-   Excited electrons from Photosystem I are used to reduce NADP⁺
    (forming NADPH)
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem I are replaced by the
    de-energised electrons from Photosystem II
-   The electrons lost from Photosystem II are replaced following the
    photolysis of water
-   The products of the light dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) are
    used in the light independent reactions

Z Scheme

The energy changes (oxidation / reduction) that occur during
photosynthesis may be represented as a Z scheme:

-   First vertical bar: Â Photosystem II electrons are energised by
    light (electrons replaced by photolysis of water molecules)
-   Diagonal bar: Â Electrons lose energy as they pass through an
    electron transport chain (synthesising ATP)
-   Second vertical bar: Â Photosystem I electrons are energised by
    light (electrons used to reduce NADP⁺)

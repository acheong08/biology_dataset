Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fatty acids can be saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated

Â  Â Â 
Fatty acids are long hydrocarbon chains that are found in certain types
of lipids (triglycerides & phospholipids)

-   Fatty acids may differ in the length of the hydrocarbon chain
    (typically 4 â€“ 24 carbons) and in the number of double bonds

Fatty acids that possessÂ noÂ double bonds areÂ saturatedÂ (have maximum
number of H atoms)

-   Saturated fatty acids are linear in structure, originate from animal
    sources (i.e. fats) and are typically solid at room temperatures

Fatty acids with double bonds are unsaturated â€“ either monounsaturated
(1 double bond) or polyunsaturated (>1 double bond)

-   Unsaturated fatty acids are bent in structure, originate from plant
    sources (i.e. oils) and are typically liquid at room temperatures

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Unsaturated fatty acids can be cis or trans isomers

Â  Â Â 
Unsaturated fatty acids may occur in two distinct structural
configurations â€“ cis and trans isomers

Cis: The hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon double bond are on the
same side

Trans: The hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon double bond are on
different sides
Trans fatty acids do not commonly occur in nature and are typically
produced by an industrial process called hydrogenation

Trans fatty acids are generally linear in structure (despite being
unsaturated) and are usually solid at room temperature

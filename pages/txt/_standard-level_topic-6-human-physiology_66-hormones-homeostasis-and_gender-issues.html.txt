Gender Issues

The terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, however there
are key distinctions between the two terms:

-   Sex describes the biological differences between males and females
    (e.g. genitalia, karyotype, hormone profiles, etc.)
-   Gender describes the characteristics that society delineates as
    masculine or feminineÂ 

Normally, sex determination happensÂ pre-natally and so infants are
categorised at birth as either male or female

-   The biological differences that exist between the sexes result from
    the presence or absence of a Y chromosome
-   All embryos will develop as females unless genes present on the Y
    chromosome trigger male sex development

Males

-   Males possess the SRY gene (on the Y chromosome), which synthesises
    testis determining factor (TDF)
-   The testis produces a hormone called MIF (Mullerian Inhibiting
    Factor), which causes degeneration of female organsÂ 
-   The testis also produces testosterone, which promotes the
    development of male sex characteristics

Females

-   Females do not possess the SRY gene (do not have a Y chromosome),
    and so do not produce TDF or form testes
-   Consequently, MIF is not produced and the female organs are allowed
    to develop (ovaries are formed)
-   Ovaries do not produce testosterone and so female sex
    characteristics develop

Sex Determination

[gonad differentiation]

Sometimes errors occur during this prenatal development of sex
characteristics, leading to issues in the assignment of gender

-   Examples of conditions where sexual development does not follow
    standard genetic instructions includeÂ androgen insensitivity
    syndrome and guevedoces (late onset sex development)Â 

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome

-   Individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome do not respond to
    the production of testosterone
-   Testosterone is responsible for the development of male sex
    characteristics (female sex characteristics develop in its absence)
-   Males who suffer from androgen insensitivity do not therefore
    develop external male genitalia (despite having internal testes)
-   Because they do not respond to testosterone, they develop female sex
    characteristics (such as enlarged breasts)
-   Despite being genetically male (XY), these individuals physically
    resemble females and will associate with that gender

Guevedoces

-   Guevedoces are girls who turn into boys at puberty
-   Guevedoces possess a rare genetic mutation which prevents the
    synthesis of the enzyme 5-Î±-reductase
-   This enzyme converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT),
    triggering a hormone surge that develops male genitalia
-   Without this enzyme, genetic males (XY) do not initially develop
    male genitals and instead develop as females
-   A second hormone surge occurs with the onset of puberty, and it is
    at this point that the male genitals develop

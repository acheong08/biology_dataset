D2 Â Digestion

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Digestion is controlled by Â 
nervous and hormonal mechanisms

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Nervous and hormonal mechanisms control the secretion of digestive
    juices
-   Exocrine glands secrete to the surface of the body or the lumen of
    the gut
-   The volume and content of gastric secretions are controlled by
    nervous and hormonal mechanisms
-   Acid conditions in the stomach favour some hydrolysis reactions and
    help to control pathogens in ingested food
-   The structure of cells of the epithelium of the villi is adapted to
    the absorption of food
-   The rate of transit of materials through the large intestine is
    positively correlated with their fibre content
-   Materials not absorbed are egested

Applications:

-   The reduction of stomach acid secretion by proton pump inhibitor
    drugs
-   Dehydration due to cholera toxin
-   Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of stomach ulcers

Skills:

-   Identification of exocrine gland cells that secrete digestive juices
    and villus epithelium cells that absorb digested foods from electron
    micrographs

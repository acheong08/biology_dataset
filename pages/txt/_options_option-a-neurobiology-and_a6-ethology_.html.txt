[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Natural selection favours
specific types of behaviour

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Ethology is the study of animal behaviour in natural conditions
-   Natural selection can change the frequency of observed animal
    behaviour
-   Behaviour that increases the chances of survival and reproduction
    become more prevalent in a population
-   Learned behaviour can spread through a population or be lost from it
    more rapidly than innate behaviour

Applications:

-   Migratory behaviour in blackcaps as an example of the genetic basis
    of behaviour and its change by natural selection
-   Blood sharing in vampire bats as an example of the development of
    altruistic behaviour by natural selection
-   Foraging behaviour in shore crabs as an example of increasing
    chances of survival by optimal prey choice
-   Breeding strategies in coho salmon populations as an example of
    behaviour affecting chances of survival and reproduction
-   Courtship in birds of paradise as an example of mate selection
-   Synchronised oestrus in female lions in a pride as an example of
    innate behaviour that increases the chances of survival and
    reproduction of offspring
-   Feeding on cream from milk bottles in blue tits as an example of the
    development and loss of learned behaviour

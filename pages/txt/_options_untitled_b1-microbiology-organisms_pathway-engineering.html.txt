Understanding:

â€¢ Â Pathway engineering optimises genetic and regulatory processes
within microorganisms

â€¢ Â Pathway engineering is used industrially to produce metabolites of
interest

Â  Â Â 
Pathway engineering involves the manipulation of genetic and regulatory
processes to produce metabolites of interest

-   Primary metabolites are compounds that are essential to the growth
    and development of the microorganism (e.g. citric acid)
-   Secondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly involved
    in growth and development (e.g. penicillin)

Pathway engineering optimises metabolic processes to increase yields or
produce exogenous metabolites

-   Yields can be increased byÂ over-expressing genes involved in a
    pathway, or blocking expression of competing pathways
-   New products can be produced by inserting genes of interest (e.g.
    enzymes) into established metabolic processes

As a cell requires certain metabolic pathways for survival, increases in
yields must be balanced against survival requirements

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Photosynthesis is the production of carbon compounds in cells
using light energy

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthesis is the process by which cells synthesise organic
compounds (e.g. glucose) from inorganic molecules (CO₂ and H₂O) in the
presence of sunlight

This process requires a photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll) and can
only occur in certain organisms (plants, certain bacteria)

Photosynthesis Equation

[photosynthesis equation]

Photosynthetic organisms use the light energy from the sun to create
chemical energy (ATP)

-   This chemical energy can either be used directly by the organism or
    used to synthesise organic compounds (e.g. glucose)

Animals then consume these organic compounds as food and release the
stored energy via cell respiration

-   Photosynthesis (anabolic synthesis of organic compounds) is
    essentially the reverse of cell respiration (catabolic breakdown)

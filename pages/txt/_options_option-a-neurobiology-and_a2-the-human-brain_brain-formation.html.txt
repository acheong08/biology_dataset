Understanding:

â€¢ Â The anterior part of the neural tube expands to form the brain

Â  Â Â 
During embryonic development, the neural tube will enlarge and develop
into different components of the nervous system:

-   The anterior part of the neural tube will expand to form the brain
    during cephalisation (development of the head)
-   The remainder of the neural tube will develop into the spinal cord
-   Cells that comprised the neural crest will differentiate to form
    most of the peripheral nervous system

The embryonic brain will initially be composed of three primary
structures â€“ the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain

-   These structures will eventually give rise to the identifiable
    components of the developed brain

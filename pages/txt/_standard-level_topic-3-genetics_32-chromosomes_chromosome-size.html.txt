â€¢ Â Cairnsâ€™ technique for measuring the length of DNA molecules by
autoradiography

Â  Â Â 
Autoradiography

-   Cells are grown in a solution containing radioactive thymidine
    (tritiated thymidine â€“ ³H-T)
-   The tritiated thymidine is incorporated into the chromosomal DNA of
    the cell (³H-T is used as thymidine is not present in RNA)
-   The chromosomes are isolated by gently lysing the cells and fixing
    the chromosomes to a photographic surface
-   The surface is then immersed in a radioactively-sensitive emulsion
    containing silver bromide (AgBr)
-   The radiation released from the tritiated thymidine converts the Ag⁺
    ions in silver bromide into insoluble metal grains
-   Following a period of exposure, excess silver bromide is washed
    away, leaving the silver grains to appear as small black dots
-   When the photographic film is developed, the chromosomal DNA can be
    visualised with an electron microscope

Chromosome Length

-   John Cairns pioneered a technique for measuring the length of DNA
    molecules by autoradiography
-   Previously, chromosome length could only be measured while condensed
    during mitosis (very inaccurate due to supercoiling)
-   Cairns used autoradiography to visualise the chromosomes whilst
    uncoiled, allowing for more accurate indications of length
-   By using tritiated uracil (³H-U), regions of active transcription
    can be identified within the uncoiled chromosome

Other Discoveries

John Cairns was further able to use autoradiography to demonstrate key
events which occur during chromosomal replication

1.  DNA replication involves formation of a replication bubble (and
    prokaryotic replication involves a single origin of replication)
2.  DNA replication is bi-directional (it occurs independently at both
    ends of the replication bubble)

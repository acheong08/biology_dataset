Understanding:

â€¢ Â Species have either an autotrophic or heterotrophic method of
nutrition (a few species have both methods)

Â  Â Â 
Living organisms obtain chemical energy in one of two ways:

Autotrophs

-   Synthesises its own organic molecules from simple inorganic
    substances (e.g. CO₂, nitrates)
-   Energy for this process is derived from sunlight (photosynthesis) or
    via the oxidation of inorganic molecules (chemosynthesis)
-   Because autotrophs synthesise their own organic molecules they are
    commonly referred to as producers

Heterotrophs

-   Obtains organic molecules from other organisms (either living /
    recently killed or their non-living remains and detritus)
-   Because heterotrophs cannot produce their own organic molecules and
    obtain it from other sources, they are called consumers

Mixotrophs

-   Certain unicellular organisms may on occasion use both forms of
    nutrition, depending on resource availability
-   Euglena gracilis possess chlorophyll for photosynthesis
    (autotrophic) but may also feed on detritus (heterotrophic)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Classifying species as autotrophs, consumers, detritivores or
saprotrophs based on their mode of nutrition

Â  Â Â 
Species can be classified according to their mode of nutrition

-   Autotrophs produce their own organic molecules using either light
    energy or energy derived from the oxidation of chemicals
-   Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules from other organisms via one
    of three methods:
    -   Consumers ingest organic molecules from living or recently
        killed organisms
    -   Detritivores ingest organic molecules found in the non-living
        remnants of organisms (e.g. detritus, humus)
    -   Saprotrophs release digestive enzymes and then absorb the
        external products of digestion (decomposers)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles but
co-dominant alleles have joint effects

Â  Â Â 
The gene composition (i.e. allele combination) for a specific trait is
referred to as the genotypeÂ 

-   The genotype of a particular gene will typically be either
    homozygous or heterozygous

The observable characteristics of a specific trait (i.e. the physical
expression) is referred to as the phenotype

-   The phenotype is determined by both the genotype and environmental
    influencesÂ 

Complete Dominance

Most traits follow a classical dominant / recessive pattern of
inheritance, whereby one allele is expressed over the other

-   The dominant allele will mask the recessive allele when in a
    heterozygous state
-   Homozygous dominant and heterozygous forms will be phenotypically
    indistinguishable
-   The recessive allele will only be expressed in the phenotype when in
    a homozygous state

When representing alleles, the convention is to capitalise the dominant
allele and use a lower case letter for the recessive allele

-   An example of this mode of inheritance is mouse coat colour â€“
    black coats (BB or Bb) are dominant to brown coats (bb)

Co-dominance

Co-dominance occurs when pairs of alleles are both expressed equally in
the phenotype of a heterozygous individual

-   Heterozygotes therefore have an altered phenotype as the alleles are
    having a joint effect

When representing alleles, the convention is to use superscripts for the
different co-dominant alleles (recessive still lower case)

-   An example of co-dominance is feathering in chickens â€“ black
    (C^(B)) and white (C^(W)) feathers create a speckled coat
    (C^(B)C^(W))

Application:

â€¢ Â Inheritance of ABO blood groups

Â  Â Â 
Human red blood cells can be categorised into different blood groups
based on the structure of a surface glycoprotein (antigen)

-   The ABO blood groups are controlled by a single gene with multiple
    alleles (A, B, O)

The A, B and O alleles all produce a basic antigen on the surface of red
blood cells

-   The A and B alleles are co-dominant and each modify the structure of
    the antigen to produce different variants
-   The O allele is recessive and does not modify the basic antigenic
    structure

When representing blood group alleles, the letter I is used to represent
the different antigenic forms (isoantigens)

-   A allele = I^(A) Â ; Â B allele = I^(B) Â ; Â O allele = i
    (recessive)

The genotypes for the different blood groups can be summarised as
follows:

[blood type table]

As humans produce antibodies against foreign antigens, blood
transfusions are not compatible between certain blood groups

-   AB blood groups can receive blood from any other type (as they
    already possess both antigenic variants on their cells)
-   A blood groups cannot receive B blood or AB blood (as the isoantigen
    produced by the B allele is foreign)
-   B blood groups cannot receive A blood or AB blood (as the isoantigen
    produced by the A allele is foreign)
-   O blood groups can only receive transfusions from other O blood
    donor (both antigenic variants are foreign)

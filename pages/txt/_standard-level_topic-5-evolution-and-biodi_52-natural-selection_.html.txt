5.2 Â Natural Selection

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The diversity of life has evolved and
continues to evolve by natural selection

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   NaturalÂ selection can only occur if there is variation among
    members of the same species
-   Mutation, meiosis and sexual reproduction cause variation between
    individuals in a species
-   Adaptations are characteristics that make an individual suited to
    its environment and way of life
-   Species tend to produce more offspring than the environment can
    support
-   Individuals that are better adapted tend to survive and produce more
    offspring while the less well adapted tend to die or produce fewer
    offspring
-   Individuals that reproduce pass on characteristics to their
    offspring
-   Natural selection increases theÂ frequency of characteristics that
    make individuals better adapted and decreases the frequency of other
    characteristics leading to changes within the species

Applications:

-   Changes inÂ beaks of finches on Daphne Major
-   Evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria

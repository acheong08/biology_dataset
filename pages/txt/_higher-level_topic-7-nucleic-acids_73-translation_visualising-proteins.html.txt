Haemoglobin

-   Haemoglobin is a globular protein responsible for oxygen transport
    within red blood cells
-   It has a quaternary structure made up of four polypeptide subunits
    (2 alpha subunits and 2 beta subunits)
-   Each polypeptide chain is associated with a prosthetic heme group
    (responsible for oxygen binding)

Aquaporin

-   Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins that form channels that
    allow for the passage of water molecules
-   Aquaporins form tetramers in the cell membrane, with each monomer
    allowing for water movement
-   The pores of the aquaporin are impermeable to charged species, thus
    preventing the passage of ions or solutes

Keratin

-   Keratin is a fibrous protein that functions as a key structural
    material in hair, skin and nails
-   Keratin proteins form long twisted strands that may interconnect via
    disulphide bridges
-   Tougher keratin fibres found in hair and nails have more disulphide
    bridges than more elastic keratin fibres found in skin

Green Fluorescent Protein

-   Green fluorescent protein is a fluorophore produced by jellyfish
    (and commonly used in recombinant DNA experiments)
-   The fluorescing chromophore is attached to a central alpha helix,
    which is surrounded by 11 beta strands forming a barrel
-   The tightly packed beta barrel excludes solvent molecules and
    functions to protect the chromophore from quenching by water

-   It is the only substance occurring naturally in all three states
    (solid, liquid, gas) on the Earthâ€™s surface
-   It is required for the anabolic construction of organic molecules
    (via condensation reactions)
-   Water is an important medium for metabolic reactions as it is
    essential to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function

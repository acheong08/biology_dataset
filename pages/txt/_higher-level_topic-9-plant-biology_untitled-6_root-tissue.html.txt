Root Tissue

Below is a microscopic cross-section of a typical root (taken from a
dicotyledonous plant)

-   Distribution of tissues may differ between different types of plants
    according to functional requirements

Key Features:

-   The outer layer (epidermis) may have protrusions called root hairs
    to increase available surface area for material exchange
-   The central region is called the stele and is surrounded by an
    endodermis with a Casparian strip (controls water transport)
-   The pericycle / cambium provides strength to the root and is also
    responsible for the development of lateral roots
-   The vascular bundle is located centrally to withstand stretching
    forces and allow for material transport to be controlled

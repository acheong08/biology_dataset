Historical Perspective of Sexual Reproduction

One of the earliest theories as to how animals reproduce sexually was
the 'soil and seed' theory proposed by Aristotle

-   According to this theory, the male produces aÂ â€˜seed' which forms
    anÂ â€˜egg' when mixed with menstrual blood (theÂ â€˜soilâ€™)
-   TheÂ â€˜eggâ€™ then develops into a fetus inside the mother
    according to the information contained within the male
    'seedâ€™Â alone

Debunking theÂ â€™Soil and Seedâ€™ TheoryÂ 

TheÂ â€˜soil and seedâ€™ theory was a popular doctrine for hundreds of
years before it was eventually debunked by William Harvey

-   William Harvey studied the sexual organs of female deer after mating
    in an effort to identify the developing embryo
-   He was unable to detect a growing embryo until approximately 6 â€“ 7
    weeks after mating had occurred
-   He concluded that Aristotleâ€™s theory was incorrect and that
    menstrual blood did not contribute to the development of aÂ fetus
-   Harvey was unable to identify the correct mechanism of sexual
    reproduction and incorrectly asserted that the fetus did not develop
    from a mixture of male and femaleÂ â€˜seedsâ€™

Modern Theory of Sexual Reproduction

Our current understanding of the mechanism of sexual reproduction is
based on evidence discovered using light microscopes

-   Viable microscopes for such investigations were not invented until
    17 years after the death of William Harvey

Based on available evidence, it is now known that a fetus forms from a
combination of both male and femalesÂ â€˜seedsâ€™ (gametes)

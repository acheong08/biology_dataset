Understanding:

â€¢ Â The heart beat is initiated by a group of specialised muscle cells
in the right atrium called the sinoatrial node

â€¢ Â The sinoatrial node acts as a pacemaker

Â  Â Â 
The contraction of the heart is myogenic â€“ meaning that the signal for
cardiac compression arises within the heart tissue itself

-   In other words, the signal for a heart beat is initiated by the
    heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) rather than from brain signals

Within the wall of the right atrium are a specialised cluster of
cardiomyocytes which direct the contraction of heart muscle tissue

-   This cluster of cells are collectively called the sinoatrial node
    (SA node or SAN)

The sinoatrial node acts as the primary pacemaker â€“ controlling the
rate at which the heart beats (i.e. paceÂ â€˜makingâ€™)

-   The SA node triggers roughly 60 â€“ 100 cardiac contractions per
    minute (normal sinus rhythm)
-   If the SA node fails, a secondary pacemaker (AV node) may maintain
    cardiac contractions at roughly 40 â€“ 60 bpm
-   If both fail, a final tertiary pacemaker (Bundle of His) may
    coordinate contractions at a constant rate of roughly 30 â€“ 40Â bpm

The interference of the pacemakers will lead to the irregular and
uncoordinated contraction of the heart muscle (fibrillation)

-   When fibrillation occurs, normal sinus rhythm may be re-established
    with a controlled electrical current (defibrillation)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The sinoatrial node sends out an electrical signal that stimulates
contraction as it is propagated through theÂ 

Â  Â Â walls of the atria and then the walls of the ventricles

Â  Â Â 
The electrical conduction of a heart beat occurs according to the
following events:

-   The sinoatrial node sends out an electrical impulse that stimulates
    contraction of the myocardium (heart muscle tissue)
-   This impulse directly causes the atria to contract and stimulates
    another node at the junction between the atrium and ventricle
-   This second node â€“ the atrioventricular node (AV node) â€“ sends
    signals down the septum via a nerve bundle (Bundle of His)
-   The Bundle of His innervates nerve fibres (Purkinje fibres) in the
    ventricular wall, causing ventricular contraction

This sequence of events ensures there is a delay between atrial and
ventricular contractions, resulting in two heart sounds

-   This delay allows time for the ventricles to fill with blood
    following atrial contractions so as to maximise blood flow

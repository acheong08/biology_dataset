Gastric Pits

The stomach wall is lined with millions of gastric pits which release
gastric juice into the stomach lumen

-   Gastric juice is an acidic solution that functions to break down
    food into a creamy paste called chyme

The gastric pits are lined by a number of different cell types which
contribute to the overall function of the stomach:

-   Goblet cells â€“ secrete mucus to form a protective layer around the
    stomach lining
-   Parietal cells â€“ secrete hydrochloric acid which is responsible
    for creating a low pH environment in the stomach
-   G cells â€“ secrete gastrin (stimulates release of stomach acids to
    increase stomach acidity)
-   D cells â€“ secrete somatostatin (inhibits release of stomach acids
    to reduce stomach acidity)
-   Chief cells â€“ secrete pepsinogen (inactive protease precursor
    which is activated by acidity to form active pepsin)

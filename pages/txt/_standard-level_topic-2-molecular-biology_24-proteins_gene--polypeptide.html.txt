Understanding:

â€¢ Â The amino acid sequence of polypeptides is coded for by genes

Â  Â Â 
A gene is a sequence of DNA which encodes a polypeptide sequence

A gene sequence is converted into a polypeptide sequence via two
processes:

-   Transcription â€“ making an mRNA transcript based on a DNA template
    (occurs within the nucleus)
-   Translation â€“ using the instructions of the mRNA transcript to
    link amino acids together (occurs at the ribosome)

Typically, one gene will code for one polypeptide â€“ however there are
exceptions to this rule:

-   Genes may be alternatively spliced to generate multiple polypeptide
    variants
-   Genes encoding tRNA sequences are transcribed but never translated
-   Genes may be mutated (their base sequence is changed) and
    consequently produce an alternative polypeptide sequence

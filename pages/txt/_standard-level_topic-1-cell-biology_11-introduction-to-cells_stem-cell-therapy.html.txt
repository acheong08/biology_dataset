Application:

â€¢ Â Use of stem cells to treat Stargardtâ€™s disease and one other
named condition

Â  Â Â 
Stem cells can be used to replace damaged or diseased cells with
healthy, functioning ones

This process requires:

-   The use of biochemical solutions to trigger the differentiation of
    stem cells into the desired cell type
-   Surgical implantation of cells into the patientâ€™s own tissue
-   Suppression of host immune system to prevent rejection of cells (if
    stem cells are from foreign source)
-   Careful monitoring of new cells to ensure they do not become
    cancerous

Examples of Stem Cell Therapy

1.Â Â Stargardtâ€™s Disease

-   An inherited form of juvenile macular degeneration that causes
    progressive vision loss to the point of blindness
-   Caused by a gene mutation that impairs energy transport in retinal
    photoreceptor cells, causing them to degenerate
-   Treated by replacing dead cells in the retina with functioning ones
    derived from stem cells

2.Â  Parkinsonâ€™s Disease

-   A degenerative disorder of the central nervous system caused by the
    death ofÂ dopamine-secreting cells in the midbrain
-   Dopamine is a neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting signals
    involved in the production of smooth, purposeful movements
-   Consequently, individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease typically
    exhibit tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement and postural
    instability
-   Treated by replacing dead nerve cells with living,
    dopamine-producing ones

3.Â Â Other Therapeutic Examples

-   Leukemia: Â Bone marrow transplants for cancer patients who are
    immunocompromised as a result of chemotherapy
-   Paraplegia: Â Repair damage caused by spinal injuries to enable
    paralysed victims to regain movement
-   Diabetes: Â Replace non-functioning islet cells with those capable
    of producing insulin in type I diabetics
-   Burn victims: Â Graft new skin cells to replace damaged tissue

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ethics of theÂ therapeutic use of stem cells from specially
created embryos, from the umbilicalÂ 

Â  Â cord blood of a new-born baby and from an adultâ€™s own tissues

Â  Â Â 
Stem cells can be derived from one of three sources:

-   Embryos (may be specially created by therapeutic cloning)
-   Umbilical cord blood or placenta of a new-born baby
-   Certain adult tissues like the bone marrow (cells are not
    pluripotent)Â 

The ethical considerations associated with the therapeutic use of stem
cells will depend on the source

-   Using multipotent adult tissue may be effective for certain
    conditions, but is limited in its scope of application
-   Stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood need to be stored and
    preserved at cost, raising issues of availability and access
-   The greatest yield of pluripotent stem cells comes from embryos, but
    requires the destruction of a potential living organism

Artificial Stem Cell Techniques

Stem cells can be artificially generated via nuclear transfer or nuclear
reprogramming, with distinct benefits and disadvantages

-   Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT):Â 
    -   Involves the creation of embryonic clones by fusing a diploid
        nucleus with an enucleated egg cell (therapeutic cloning)
    -   More embryos are created by this process than needed, raising
        ethical concerns about the exigency of excess embryos

-   Nuclear reprogramming:
    -   Induce a change in the gene expression profile of a cell in
        order to transform it into a different cell type
        (transdifferentiation)Â 
    -   Involves the use of oncogenic retroviruses and transgenes,
        increasing the risk of health consequences (i.e. cancer)

Biomagnification

Because energy transformations are only ~10% efficient, higher trophic
levels must consume more prey to meet energy needs

If a pollutant is ingested by living organisms, it will become
concentrated at higher trophic levels as they eat more exposed prey

-   The increase of a substance (such as a pollutant) in a particular
    organisms is called bioaccumulation
-   The increase in the concentration of a substance at a particular
    trophic level is called biomagnification

Bioaccumulation refers to how pollutants enter a food chain, whereas
biomagnification refers to the tendency of pollutants to concentrate as
they move from one trophic level to the next
Because pollutants become concentrated by biomagnification, higher
trophic levels are more susceptible to their toxic effects

-   The pesticide DDT caused egg-shell thinning and population declines
    in species of birds that fed on exposed insectsÂ 
-   Heavy metals (like mercury) released into waterways via industrial
    processes may become concentrated in fish

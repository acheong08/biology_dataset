Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA is a double helix molecule made of two antiparallel strands of
nucleotides linked by hydrogen bonding

Â  Â between complementary base pairs

Â  Â Â 
Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotide monomers which are linked into
a single strand via condensation reactions

-   The phosphate group of one nucleotide attaches to the sugar of
    another nucleotide (at the 3â€™â€“ hydroxyl (-OH) group)
-   This results in a phosphodiester bond forming between the two
    nucleotides (and water is produced as a by-product)
-   Successive condensation reactions result in the formation of long
    polynucleotide strands

Two polynucleotide chains of DNA are held together via hydrogen bonding
between complementary nitrogenous bases

-   Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) via two hydrogen bonds
-   Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) via three hydrogen bonds

In order for the bases to be facing each other and thus able to pair,
the strands must be running in opposite directionsÂ 

-   The two strands of DNA are described as being antiparallel

As the antiparallel chains lengthen, the atoms will organise themselves
into the most stableÂ energy configurationÂ Â 

-   This atomic arrangement results in the double-stranded DNA forming a
    double helix (~10 â€“ 15 bases per twist)

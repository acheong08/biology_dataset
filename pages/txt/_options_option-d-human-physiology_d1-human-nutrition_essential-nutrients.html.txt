Understanding:

â€¢ Â Essential nutrients cannot be synthesised by the body, therefore
they have to be included in the diet

Â  Â Â 
A nutrient is a chemical substance found in foods that is used in the
human body

-   There are six classes of nutrients â€“ carbohydrates, proteins,
    lipids, vitamins, minerals and water

Essential nutrients are those that cannot be synthesised by the body and
must be ingested as part of the diet

-   Non-essential nutrients can be made by the body or have a
    replacement nutrient which serves the same dietary purpose
-   Carbohydrates are not considered essential nutrients as human diets
    can obtain energy from other sources without ill effect

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Malnutrition may be caused by a deficiency, imbalance or excess of
nutrients in the diet

Â  Â Â 
Malnutrition is a health condition caused by a deficiency, imbalance or
excess of nutrients in the diet

-   It can be caused by an improper dietary intake of nutrients â€“ e.g.
    overnutrition (too much) or undernutrition (not enough)
-   It can be caused by the inadequate utilisation of nutrients by the
    body â€“ e.g. due to illness or disease

The symptoms of malnutrition will vary according to the specific
nutrient and the type of imbalance involved

-   Common signs of malnutrition included stunted growth and wasting
    (undernutrition), as well as obesity (over nutrition)

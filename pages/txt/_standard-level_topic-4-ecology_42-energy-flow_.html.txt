4.2 Â Energy Flow

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Ecosystems require a continuous supply of energyÂ 
to fuel life processes and to replace energy lost as heat

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Most ecosystems rely on a supply of energy from sunlight
-   Light energy is converted to chemical energy in carbon compounds by
    photosynthesis
-   Chemical energy in carbon compounds flows through food chains by
    means of feeding
-   Energy released from carbon compounds by respiration is used in
    living organisms and converted to heat
-   Living organisms cannot convert heat to other forms of energy
-   Heat is lost from ecosystems
-   Energy losses between trophic levels restrict the length of food
    chains and the biomass of higher trophic levels

Skills:

-   Quantitative representations of energy flow using pyramids of energy

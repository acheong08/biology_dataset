Animal versus Plant Cells

Animal cells and plant cells are both types of eukaryotic cells and
hence share many common features, including:

-   DNA stored within a nucleus
-   Larger ribosomes (80S in size)
-   A variety of membrane-bound organelles (e.g. mitochondria, ER, golgi
    apparatus)

However there are also a number of key differences that separate the two
types of cells, including:

-   Presence or absence of specific sub-cellular structures
-   Composition of the plasma membrane

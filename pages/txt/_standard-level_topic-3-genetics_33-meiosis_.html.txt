3.3 Â Meiosis

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Alleles segregate during meiosis allowing new
combinations to be formed by the fusion of gametes

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   One diploid nucleus divides by meiosis to produce four haploid
    nuclei
-   Separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes in the firstÂ division
    of meiosis halves the chromosome number
-   DNA is replicated before meiosis so that all chromosomes consist of
    two sister chromatids
-   The early stages of meiosis involve pairing of homologous
    chromosomes and crossing over followed by condensation
-   Orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes prior to separation
    is random
-   The halving of the chromosome number allows a sexual life cycle with
    fusion of gametes
-   Crossing over and random orientation promotes genetic variation
-   Fusion of gametes from different parents promotes genetic variation

Applications:

-   Non-disjunction can cause Down syndrome and other chromosomal
    abnormalities
-   Studies showing age of parents influences chances of non-disjunction
-   Description of methods used to obtain cells for karyotype analysis
    â€“ e.g. chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis and the
    associated risks

Skills:

-   Drawing diagrams to show the stages of meiosis resulting in the
    formation of four haploid cells

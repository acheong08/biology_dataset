Understanding:

â€¢ Â The rate of turnover in the phosphorus cycle is much lower than
the nitrogen cycle

Â  Â Â 
The phosphorus cycle shows how different forms of phosphorus are
transitioned within the environment

-   Certain rocks contain high levels of phosphate, which can be
    released into the soil and water via chemical weathering
-   Organisms require these phosphates to synthesise nucleic acids,
    membranes (phospholipids) and ATP
-   Phosphates are returned to the soil upon the decomposition of plant
    and animal remains

The phosphorus cycle does not include a gaseous component (i.e. it does
not involve the atmosphere)

-   This means the rate of turnover in the phosphorus cycle is much
    lower than other cycles (it is released slowly by weathering)
-   This also means the rate of replenishment is extremely slow
    (phosphates removed from the soil are not quickly replaced)

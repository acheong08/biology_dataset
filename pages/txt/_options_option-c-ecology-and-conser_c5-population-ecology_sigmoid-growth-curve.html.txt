Understanding:

â€¢ Â Phases shown in the sigmoid curve can be explained by rates of
natality, mortality, immigration and emigration

Â  Â Â 
Stable populations occupying a fixed geographic space demonstrate a
sigmoidal (S-shaped) population growth curve

-   This curve will typically follow three key stages â€“ an exponential
    growth phase, a transitional phase and a plateau phase

Exponential Growth Phase

-   Initially, population growth will be slow (lag period) as there are
    few reproductive individuals that are likely widely dispersed
-   As numbers accumulate, there is a rapid increase in population size
    as natality greatly exceeds mortality
-   Mortality is low because there are abundant resources and minimal
    environmental resistance

Transitional Phase

-   As the population continues to grow, resources eventually become
    limited, which leads to competition for survival
-   Natality rates start to fall and mortality rates begin to rise,
    leading to a slowing of population growth

Plateau Phase

-   Eventually the increasing mortality rate equals the natality rate
    and population growth becomes static
-   The population has reached the carrying capacity (Îº) of the
    environment, with limiting factors keeping the population stable
-   The population size at this point will not be constant, but will
    oscillate around the carrying capacity to remain even

Sigmoid Population Growth Curve

[population growth curve]

The stages of the sigmoidal population growth curve can be summarised as
follows:

-   Exponential Growth Phase: Â N + I >>> M + E Â (much greater than)
-   Transitional Phase: Â N + I > M + E Â (greater than)
-   Plateau Phase: Â N + I = M + E Â (equal)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Modelling the growth curve using a simple organism such as yeast
or a species of Lemna

Â  Â Â 
Population growth curves can be modelled using simple organisms such as
yeast or duckweed (Lemna)

-   These organisms can be grown on agar plates (yeast) or in cups of
    water (duckweed)

There are many benefits to using simple organisms like yeast and
duckweed to model population growth:

-   These organisms are small and so can easily populate small
    containers that are easy to store
-   Nutritional requirements are low, making experiments inexpensive to
    conduct
-   These organisms reproduce very rapidly, allowing results to be
    generated in a relatively short period of time

Yeast and Duckweed

[yeast duckweed]

When grown in controlled conditions, these simple organisms will
demonstrate the phases of a sigmoidal growth curve:

-   After an initial lag period, there will be a period of exponential
    growth whilst resources remain abundant
-   As resources become limited, the growth rate may begin to
    slowÂ before eventually becoming stationary (plateau)
-   Because organisms are being grown in closed systems, an accumulation
    of metabolic waste will inevitably occur
-   This will eventually lead to an increase in the rate of death and an
    overall reduction in population size Â

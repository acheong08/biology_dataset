Application:

â€¢ Â Comparison of the number of genes in humans with other species

Â  Â Â 
The number of genes present in an organism will differ between species
and is not a valid indicator of biological complexity
The number of genes in a genome is usually predicted by identifying
sequences common to genes

-   These identifying regions may include expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
    or sequences that areÂ homologousÂ to known genes
-   The presence of pseudogenes and transposons make accurate counts of
    unique gene numbers very difficult

As scientists may use different approaches to predicting gene numbers,
final estimations can vary significantlyÂ 

-   For instance, the number of genes in rice (Oryza sativa) is
    estimated as being between 32,000 â€“ 50,000
-   The number of genes in humans is estimated as being between 19,000
    â€“ 25,000

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of a database to determine differences in the base sequence of
a gene in two species

Â  Â Â 
Gene sequences from different species can be identified and then
compared using two online resources:

-   GenBank â€“ a genetic database that serves as an annotated
    collection of DNA sequences
-   Clustal Omega â€“ an alignment program that compares multiple
    sequences of DNA

Identifying Gene Sequences

GenBank can be used to identify the DNA sequence for a gene in a number
of different species

To identify a specific gene sequence:

-   Change the search parameter from nucleotide to gene and type in the
    name of the gene of interest
-   Choose the species of interest and click on the link (underÂ â€˜Name
    / Gene IDâ€™)
-   Scroll to theÂ â€˜Genomic regions, transcripts and
    productsâ€™Â section and click on theÂ â€˜FASTAâ€™Â link

Below are examples of different genes that may be searched for:

-   HBB Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin beta gene
-   COX1 Â â€“ Â Cytochrome oxidase 1 gene
-   F8 Â â€“ Â Coagulation factor VIII gene
-   IGF1R Â â€“ Â Insulin growth factor 1 receptor gene

Comparing Gene Sequences

Clustal Omega aligns multiple gene sequences to allow for the
determination of differences in the base sequence

To construct a multiple alignment:

-   Change the input sequence type to DNA and paste the relevant FASTA
    sequences into the provided space
-   Before each sequence designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)
-   Alternatively, sequences can be saved as a document in plain text
    format (.txt) and then uploaded
-   When all sequences have been included, clickÂ â€˜Submitâ€™Â (under
    step 3)

Clustal Omega possesses several useful features that are absent in
alternative tools like BLASTN:

-   Multiple (more than two) sequences can be compared at once
-   Sequence consensus is colour coded in a Jalview applet found
    underÂ â€˜Result Summaryâ€™Â (requires Java)
-   Branched phylograms can be generated to show evolutionary
    relationships (underÂ â€˜Phylogenetic Treeâ€™)

Below is a plain text file that can be uploaded to compare gene sequence
fragments from different species:

-   CHRNE Â â€“ Â Cholinergic receptor epsilon (nicotinic) for various
    species

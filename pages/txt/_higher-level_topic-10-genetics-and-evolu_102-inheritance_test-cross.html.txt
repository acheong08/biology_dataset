Test Cross

A test cross involves mating an unknown genotypic individual with a
known homozygous recessive

-   This is because recessive alleles will always be masked by the
    presence of dominant alleles
-   Hence the phenotype of any offspring will reflect the genotype of
    the unknown parent

Testing an Unknown Dominant Phenotype

Test crosses can be used to determine whether a dominant phenotype is
homozygous or heterozygous

-   If the unknown parent is homozygous dominant, all offspring will
    express the dominant phenotype
-   If the unknown parent is heterozygous, half the offspring should be
    dominant and half recessive

Testing for Gene Linkage

Test crosses can also be used to determine if two genes are linked or
unlinked by mating with a known heterozygote

-   If there is an equal ratio of the four potential phenotypes, the two
    genes are likely unlinked (independent assortment)
-   If there are two phenotypes in high amounts and two phenotypes in
    low amounts (recombinants), the two genes are likely linked
-   A chi-squared test for association can be used to determine the
    statistical likelihood of each scenario

[test cross 2]

Test crosses require large numbers of offspring to produce reliable data
for meaningful conclusions

-   With the advent of genetic screening and genome mapping, test
    crosses have become less commonly used

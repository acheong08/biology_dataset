Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chromosomes replicate in interphase before meiosis

Â  Â Â 
Interphase is an active period that precedes meiosis and involves
keyÂ events needed to prepare the cell for successful division

DNA is replicated during the S phase of interphase, resulting in
chromosomes that contain two identical DNA strands

-   These genetically identical strands are calledÂ sister
    chromatidsÂ and are held together by a central region called the
    centromere
-   These chromatids separate during meiosis II, becoming independent
    chromosomes each made of a single DNA strand

If DNA replication did not occur prior to meiosis there would be no need
for a 2^(nd) meiotic division (meiosis I = diploidÂ â†’Â haploid)

-   The fact that DNA replication does occur suggests that meiosis
    evolved from mitosis (where initial DNA replication is necessary)
-   One benefit of the duplication of chromatids is that it increases
    the potential for genetic recombination to occur (more variation)

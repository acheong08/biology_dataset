8.1 Â Metabolism

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Metabolic reactions are regulatedÂ 
in response to the cellâ€™s needs

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Metabolic pathways consist of chains and cycles of enzyme-catalysed
    reactions
-   Enzymes lower the activation energy of the chemical reactions that
    they catalyse
-   Enzyme inhibitors can be competitive or non-competitive
-   Metabolic pathways can be controlled by end-product inhibition

Applications:

-   End-product inhibition of the pathway that converts threonine to
    isoleucine
-   Use of databases to identify potential new anti-malarial drugs

Skills:

-   Calculating and plotting rates of reaction from raw experimental
    results
-   Distinguishing different types of inhibition from graphs at
    specified substrate concentration

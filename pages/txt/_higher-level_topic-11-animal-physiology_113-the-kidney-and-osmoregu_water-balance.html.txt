â€¢ Â Consequences of dehydration andÂ overhydration

Â  Â Â 
Maintaining an appropriate water balance within the bodyâ€™s tissues and
cells is critical to the survival of an organism

-   Homeostasis cannot be maintained if water levels drop (dehydration)
    or are raised (overhydration) without regulation

Dehydration

-   Dehydration is a loss of water from the body such that body fluids
    become hypertonic
-   Individuals will experience thirst and excrete small quantities of
    heavily concentrated urine (to minimise water loss)
-   Blood pressure will drop (less water in plasma) and the heart rate
    will increase to compensate for this
-   The individual will become lethargic and experience an inability to
    lower body temperature (due to lack of sweat)
-   Severe cases of dehydration may cause seizures, brain damage and
    eventual death

Overhydration

-   Overhydration is a less common occurrence that results when an
    over-consumption of water makes body fluids hypotonic
-   Individuals will produce excessive quantities of clear urine in an
    effort to remove water from the body
-   The hypotonic body fluids will cause cells to swell (due to osmotic
    movement), which can lead to cell lysis and tissue damage
-   Overhydration can lead to headaches and disrupted nerve functions in
    mild cases (due to swelling of cells)
-   In severe cases, overhydration may lead to blurred vision, delirium,
    seizures, coma and eventual death

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The length of the loop of Henle is positively correlated with the
need for water conservation in animals

Â  Â Â 
All animals need to maintain an appropriate water balance, however the
need for water conservation will depend on habitat

-   Animals in arid, desert environments will need more efficient water
    conservation than animals in moist, mesic environments

Water conservation can be improved by having a longer loop of Henle,
which increase the salt gradient in the medulla

-   A greater the salt gradient in the medulla means more water is
    reabsorbed by the collecting ducts and urine is concentrated

Hence, the length of the loop of Henle is positively correlated with the
degree of water conservation in animals

-   Animals living in moist environments have short loops of Henle that
    donâ€™t descend deeply into the medulla (cortical nephrons)
-   Animals living in arid environments have long loops of Henle that
    descend deeply into the medulla (juxtamedullary nephrons)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Exocrine glands secrete to the surface of the body or the lumen of
the gut

Â  Â Â 
Exocrine glands produce and secrete substances via a ductÂ onto an
epithelial surface â€“ either:

-   The surface of the body (e.g. sweat glands, sebaceous glands)
-   The lumen of the digestive tract / gut (e.g. digestive glands)

Examples of digestive glands include:

-   Salivary glands â€“ secrete saliva which contains amylase (breaks
    down starch)
-   Gastric glands â€“ secretes gastric juices which includes
    hydrochloric acid and proteases (breaks down protein)
-   Pancreatic glands â€“ secretes pancreatic juices which include
    lipase, protease and amylase
-   Intestinal glands â€“ secretes intestinal juices via crypts of
    Lieberkuhn in the intestinal wall

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of exocrine gland cells that secrete digestive
juices from electron micrographs

Â  Â Â 
Exocrine glands are composed of a cluster of secretory cells which
collectively form an acinus (plural = acini)

-   The acini are surrounded by a basement membrane and are held
    together by tight junctions between secretory cells
-   The secretory cells possess a highly developed ER and golgi network
    for material secretion and are rich in mitochondria

Exocrine products are released (via secretory vesicles) into a duct,
which connects to an epithelial surface

-   These ducts may arise from a convergence of smaller ductules (each
    connected to an acinus) in order to enhance secretion

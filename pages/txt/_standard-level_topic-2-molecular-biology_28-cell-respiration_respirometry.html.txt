â€¢ Â Analysis of results from experiments involving measurement of
respiration rates in germinating seeds or

Â  Â invertebrates using a respirometer

Â  Â Â 
A respirometer is a device that determines an organismâ€™sÂ respiration
rate by measuring the rate of exchange of O₂ and CO₂

-   The living specimen (e.g. germinating seeds or invertebrate
    organism) is enclosed in a sealed container
-   Carbon dioxide production can be measured with a data logger or by
    pH changes if the specimen is immersed in water
-   When an alkali is included to absorb CO₂, oxygen consumption can be
    measured as a change in pressure within the system
    -   The pressure change can be detected with a data logger or via
        use of a U-tube manometer

Factors which may affect respiration rates include temperature,
hydration, light (plants), age and activity levels

-   An increase in carbon dioxide levels will indicate an increase in
    respiration (CO₂ is a product of aerobic respiration)
-   A decrease in oxygen levels will indicate an increase in respiration
    (O₂ is a requirement for aerobic respiration)

Application:

â€¢ Â The use in IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of
hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of

Â  Â Â hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy

Â  Â Â 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) refers to fertilisation that occurs outside
of the body (in vitro = 'in glassâ€™)

-   It involves using drugs to suspend normal ovulation (down
    regulation), before using hormone treatments to collect multiple
    eggs (superovulation)Â 

Down regulation

-   Drugs are used to halt the regular secretion of FSH and LH â€“ this
    in turn stops the secretion of estrogen and progesterone
-   By arresting the hormonal cycle, doctors can take control of the
    timing and quantity of egg production by the ovaries
-   The drug treatment usually takes about two weeks and is typically
    delivered in the form of a nasal spray

Superovulation

-   Superovulation involves using artificial doses of hormones to
    develop and collect multiple eggs from the woman
-   The patient is firstly injected with large amounts of FSH to
    stimulate the development of many follicles
-   The follicles are then treated with human chorionic gonadotrophin
    (hCG) â€“ a hormone usually produced by a developing embryo
-   hCG stimulates the follicles to mature and the egg is then collected
    (via aspiration with a needle) prior to the follicles rupturing

Fertilisation

-   The extracted eggs are then incubated in the presence of a sperm
    sample from the male donor
-   The eggs are then analysed under a microscope for successful
    fertilisation

Implantation

-   Approximately two weeks prior to implantation, the woman begins to
    take progesterone treatments to develop the endometrium
-   Healthy embryos are selected and transferred into the female uterus
    (or the uterus of a surrogate)
-   Multiple embryos are transferred to improve chances of successful
    implantation (hence multiple births are a possible outcome)
-   Roughly two weeks after the procedure, a pregnancy test is taken to
    determine if the process has been successful

Summary of the Key Stages of IVF

-   Stop normal menstrual cycleÂ (with drugs)
-   Hormone treatments to promoteÂ super ovulation
-   Extract multiple eggs from the ovaries
-   Sperm collected, then prepared (via capacitation) and injected into
    egg
-   Fertilisation occurs externally under controlled conditions (in
    vitro)
-   Implantation of multiple embryos into uterus (either patient or
    surrogate)
-   Test for pregnancy after ~ two weeks

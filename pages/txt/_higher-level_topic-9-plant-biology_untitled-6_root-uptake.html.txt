Understanding:

â€¢ Â Active uptake of mineral ions in the roots causes absorption of
water by osmosis

Â  Â Â 
Plants take up water and mineral ions from the soil via their roots and
thus need a maximal surface area to optimise this uptake

-   Some plants have a fibrous, highly branching root system which
    increases the surface area available for absorption
-   Other plants have a main tap root with lateral branches, which can
    penetrate the soil to access deeper reservoirs of water

The epidermis of roots may have cellular extensions called root hairs,
which further increases the surface area for absorption

-   Materials absorbed by the root epidermis diffuse across the cortex
    towards a central stele, where the xylem is located
-   The stele is surrounded by an endodermis layer that is impermeable
    to the passive flow of water and ions (Casparian strip)
-   Water and minerals are pumped across this barrier by specialised
    cells, allowing the rate of uptake to be controlled

Structure of a Root Â (Vascular Plant)

Mineral Uptake

Fertile soil typically contains negatively charged clay particles to
which positively charged mineral ions (cations) may attach

-   Minerals that need to be taken up from the soil include Mg²⁺ (for
    chlorophyll), nitrates (for amino acids), Na⁺, K⁺ and PO₄^(3â€“)

Mineral ions may passively diffuse into the roots, but will more
commonly be actively uploaded by indirect active transport

-   Root cells contain proton pumps that actively expel H⁺ ions (stored
    in the vacuole of root cells) into the surrounding soil
-   The H⁺ ions displace the positively charged mineral ions from the
    clay, allowing them to diffuse into the root along a gradient
-   Negatively charged mineral ions (anions) may bind to the H⁺ ions and
    be reabsorbed along with the proton

Water Uptake

Water will follow the mineral ions into the root via osmosis â€“ moving
towards the region with a higher solute concentration

-   The rate of water uptake will be regulated by specialised water
    channels (aquaporins) on the root cell membrane

Once inside the root, water will move towards the xylem either via the
cytoplasm (symplastic) or via the cell wall (apoplastic)

-   In the symplastic pathway, water moves continuously through the
    cytoplasm of cells (connected via plasmodesmata)
-   In the apoplastic pathway, water cannot cross the Casparian strip
    and is transferred to the cytoplasm of the endodermis

11.2 Â Movement

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The roles of the musculoskeletal system
are movement, support and protection

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Bones and exoskeletons provide anchorage for muscles and act as
    levers
-   Synovial joints allow certain movements but not others
-   Movement of the body requires muscles to work in antagonistic pairs
-   Skeletal muscle fibres are multinucleate and contain specialised
    endoplasmic reticulum
-   Muscle fibres contain many myofibrils
-   Each myofibril is made up of contractile sarcomeres
-   The contraction of the skeletal muscle is achieved by the sliding of
    actin and myosin filaments
-   ATP hydrolysis and cross bridge formation are necessary for the
    filaments to slide
-   Calcium ions and the proteins tropomyosin and troponin control
    muscle contractions

Applications:

-   Antagonistic pairs of muscles in an insect leg

Skills:

-   Annotation of a diagram of the human elbow
-   Drawing labelled diagrams of the structure of a sarcomere
-   Analysis of electron micrographs to find the state of contraction of
    muscle fibres

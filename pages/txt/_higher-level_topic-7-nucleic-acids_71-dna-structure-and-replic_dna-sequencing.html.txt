DNA sequencing refers to the process by which the base order of a
nucleotide sequence is elucidated

-   The most widely used method for DNA sequencing involves the use of
    chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides

Dideoxynucleotides

-   Dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) lack the 3â€™-hydroxyl group necessary
    for forming a phosphodiester bond
-   Consequently, ddNTPs prevent further elongation of a nucleotide
    chain and effectively terminate replication
-   The resulting length of a DNA sequence will reflect the specific
    nucleotide position at which the ddNTP was incorporated
    -   For example, if a ddGTP terminates a sequence after 8
        nucleotides, then the 8th nucleotide in the sequence is a
        cytosine

Determining Nucleotide Positions Using Dideoxynucleotides

Sequencing

Dideoxynucleotides can be used to determine DNA sequence using the
Sanger method

-   Four PCR mixes are set up, each containing stocks of normal
    nucleotides plus one dideoxynucleotide (ddA, ddT, ddC or ddG)
-   As a typical PCR will generate over 1 billion DNA molecules, each
    PCR mix should generate all the possible terminating fragments for
    that particular base
-   When the fragments are separated using gel electrophoresis, the base
    sequence can be determined by ordering fragments according to length
-   If a distinct radioactive or fluorescently labelled primer is
    included in each mix, the fragments can be detected by automated
    sequencing machines
-   If the Sanger method is conducted on the coding strand (non-template
    strand), the resulting sequence elucidated will be identical to the
    template strand

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Phospholipids form bilayers in water due to the amphipathic
properties of phospholipid molecules

[phospholipid structure]

Â  Â Â 
Structure of Phospholipids:

-   Consist of a polar head (hydrophilic) composed of a glycerol and a
    phosphate molecule
-   Consist of two non-polar tails (hydrophobic) composed of fatty acid
    (hydrocarbon) chains
-   Because phospholipids contain both hydrophilic (water-loving) and
    lipophilic (fat-loving) regions, they are classed as amphipathic

Arrangement in Membranes:

-   Phospholipids spontaneously arrange into a bilayer
-   The hydrophobic tail regions face inwards and are shielded from the
    surrounding polar fluids, while the two hydrophilic head regions
    associate with the cytosolic and extracellular fluids respectively

Properties of the Phospholipid Bilayer:

-   The bilayer is held together by weak hydrophobic interactions
    between the tails
-   Hydrophilic / hydrophobic layers restrict the passage of many
    substances
-   Individual phospholipids can move within the bilayer, allowing for
    membrane fluidity and flexibility
-   This fluidity allows for the spontaneous breaking and reforming of
    membranes (endocytosis / exocytosis)

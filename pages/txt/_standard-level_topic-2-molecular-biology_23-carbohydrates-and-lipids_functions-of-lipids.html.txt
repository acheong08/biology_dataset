Functions of Lipids

[ships]

Lipids can serve a diverse range of functions within a cell, including:

-   Storage of energy for long-term use (e.g. triglycerides)
-   Hormonal roles (e.g. steroids such as oestrogen and testosterone)
-   Insulation â€“ both thermal (triglycerides) and electrical
    (sphingolipids)
-   Protection of internal organs (e.g. triglycerides and waxes)
-   Structural components of cells (e.g. phospholipids and cholesterol)

Types of Lipids

-   Triglycerides:Â Â Function as a long-term energy source in animals
    (fats) and plants (oils)
-   Phospholipids:Â Â Structural component of cell membranes
-   Steroids:Â Â Act as hormones in plants and animals, and is a
    structural component of animal cell membranes (cholesterol)
-   Waxes:Â Â Act as a protective layer against water loss in plant
    leaves and animal skin
-   Carotenoids:Â Â Light-absorbing accessory pigment in plants
    (involved in photosynthesis)
-   Glycolipids:Â Â Complexes of carbohydrate and lipid that function as
    cell receptor and cell recognition molecules

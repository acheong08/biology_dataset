Stages of Prophase

Most of the events that function to differentiate meiosis from mitosis
occur inÂ Prophase I

-   Homologous chromosomes form bivalents (or tetrads) and crossing over
    occurs between non-sister chromatids

Prophase I is divided into 5 distinctive sub-stages:

-   Leptotene â€“ The chromosomes begin to condense and are attached to
    the nuclear membrane via their telomeres
-   Zygotene â€“ Synapsis begins with a synaptonemal complex forming
    between homologous chromosomes
-   Pachytene â€“ Crossing over of genetic material occurs between
    non-sister chromatids
-   Diplotene â€“ Synapsis ends with disappearance of synaptonemal
    complex; homologous pairs remain attached at chiasmata
-   Diakinesis â€“ Chromosomes become fully condensed and
    nuclearÂ membrane disintegrates prior to metaphase I

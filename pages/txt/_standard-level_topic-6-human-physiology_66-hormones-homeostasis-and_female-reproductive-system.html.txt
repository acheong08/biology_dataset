â€¢ Â Annotate diagrams of the femaleÂ reproductive system to show names
of structures and their functions

Â  Â Â 
The female reproductive system includes all the organs responsible for
the production of an oocyte (the female gamete)

-   It also includes the organs involved in initially developing and
    maintaining an embryo during the early stages of pregnancy

Structures of the Female Reproductive System

The following structures all contribute to the production
andÂ maintenance of an egg as part of the female reproductive process

-   Structures are organised according to the path taken by egg (from
    production to implantation or elimination)

Ovary

-   The ovary is where oocytes mature prior to release (ovulation) â€“
    it also responsible for estrogen and progesterone secretion

Fimbria

-   Fimbria (plural:Â fimbriae) are a fringe of tissue adjacent to an
    ovary that sweep an oocyte into the oviductÂ 

Oviduct

-   The oviduct (or fallopian tube) transports the oocyte to the uterus
    â€“ it is also typically where fertilisation occurs

Uterus

-   The uterus is the organ where a fertilised egg will implant and
    develop (becoming anÂ embryo)

Endometrium

-   The mucous membrane lining of the uterus, it thickens in preparation
    for implantation or is otherwise lost (via menstruation)

Vagina

-   Passage leading to the uterus by which the penis can enter (uterus
    protected by a muscular opening called the cervix)

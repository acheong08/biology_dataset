Stages of Digestion

The main purpose of the digestive system is to break large molecules
down into smaller subunits due to the fact that:

-   Large molecules are typically chemically inert and need to be broken
    down and reassembled into usable products
-   Large molecules are typically insoluble and cannot be absorbed into
    cells, whereas smaller subunits are soluble

The process of digestion occurs across a number of stages, including:

-   Ingestion â€“ food is taken into the body via the act of eating
-   Digestion â€“ food is broken down both physically (e.g. mastication)
    and chemically (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis)
-   Absorption â€“ digested food products are absorbed into the
    bloodstream and transported to cells
-   Assimilation â€“ digested food products are converted into the fluid
    and solid parts of a cell / tissue
-   Elimination â€“ undigested food residues are egested from the body
    as semi-solid faeces

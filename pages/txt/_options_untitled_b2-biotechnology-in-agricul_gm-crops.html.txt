Application:

â€¢ Â Use of Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to introduce
glyphosate resistance into soybean crops

Â  Â Â 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a pathogenic bacteria that induces tumors
(called crown galls) in certain species of plant

-   The bacterium inserts aÂ tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid into plant
    cells, which then integrates its DNA into the plant genome

Scientists have used Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a vector to introduce
glyphosate resistance into soybean crops

-   Glyphosate is a herbicide that competitively inhibits a plant enzyme
    (EPSPS) responsible for the synthesis of amino acids
-   Scientists have modified the Ti plasmid to include a gene coding for
    glyphosate resistance
-   When soybean crops are infected with transgenic Agrobacterium
    tumefaciens, a glyphosate-resistant crown gall develops
-   When the gall tissue is later cultured into independent plants, all
    cultured plants will carry the gene for glyphosate resistance
-   This means farmers can spray glyphosate on crops to kill competing
    weeds without harming the transgenic soybean plants

Application:

â€¢ Â Genetic modification of tobacco mosaic virus to allow bulk
production of hepatitis B vaccine in tobacco plants

Â  Â Â 
Hepatitis B is a liver disease in humans caused by a virus (HBV)â€“
however infection can be prevented by vaccination

-   Vaccination involves introducing antigenic fragments to the immune
    system in order to develop specific memory cells

The tobacco mosaic virus infects the tissue of tobacco plants and
incorporates its viral genetic material into the plant genome

-   The tobacco mosaic virus can be genetically engineered to include
    genes encoding the antigenic fragments of HBV
-   Transgenic tobacco plants will produce the HBV antigens, which can
    be extracted and purified to produce a vaccine in bulk

Application:

â€¢ Â Production of Amflora potato (SolanumÂ tuberosum) for paper and
adhesive industries

Â  Â Â 
Potatoes contain two forms of starch â€“ a branched form (amylopectin =
80%) and an unbranched form (amylose = 20%)

-   Amylopectin is responsible for the useful industrial properties of
    starch (adhesives, textiles, paper, etc.)
-   Amylose forms a gel which makes potato starch less stable and more
    difficult to use for industrial purposes

Amflora potatoes have been genetically modified to only produce
amylopectin by inhibiting the amylose-producing enzyme

-   Amflora potatoes possess an antisense copy of the gene responsible
    for amylose production
-   This antisense gene synthesises a complementary mRNA sequence that
    binds to the normal mRNA sequence
-   Consequently, the gene responsible for amylose production is not
    translated and the potato only produces amylopectin

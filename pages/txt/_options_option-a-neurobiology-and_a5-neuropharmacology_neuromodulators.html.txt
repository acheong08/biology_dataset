Understanding:

â€¢ Â Many different slow acting neurotransmitters modulate fast
synaptic transmission in the brain

Â  Â Â 
Neurotransmitters within the brain can be classified as either
fast-acting or slow-acting according to their action

-   Fast-acting neurotransmitters bind directly to ligand-gated ion
    channels to initiate a rapid response (<1 millisecond)
-   Slow-acting neurotransmitters bind to G-protein coupled receptors to
    initiate a slower response (milliseconds â€“ minute)

Slow-acting neurotransmitters trigger second messenger pathways within
the post-synaptic cell, which allows for:

-   A longer, more sustained duration of action (i.e. ion channels
    remain open for longer to mediate greater depolarisation)
-   Long term alterations to cellular activity to improve synaptic
    transfer (i.e. increased expression of ion channels)

Slow-acting neurotransmitters are called neuromodulators because they
can modulate the efficiency of synaptic transfer

-   Examples of fast-acting neurotransmitters include glutamate
    (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory)
-   Examples of slow-acting neurotransmitters include dopamine,
    serotonin, acetylcholine and noradrenaline

By modulating the efficiency of synaptic transfer, slow-acting
neurotransmitters can regulate fast synaptic transmission

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Memory and learning involve changes in neurons caused by
slow-actingÂ neurotransmitters

Â  Â Â 
Slow-acting neurotransmitters can strengthen the neural pathways
involved in learning and memory

-   By activating second messenger systems, they can trigger
    long-lasting changes to synaptic activity (long-term potentiation)

When a neuron is repetitively stimulated by slow-acting
neurotransmitters, second messengers promote cellular changes:

-   There is an increase in dendritic receptors in the
    post-synapticÂ neutron (improving post-synaptic stimulation)
-   There is an increase in the production of neurotransmitters in the
    pre-synaptic cell
-   Neurons may undergo morphological changes to enlarge existing
    synaptic connections or form new synapses

The net effect of this long-term potentiation is that certain neural
pathways become easier to stimulate

-   This makes certain memories easier to recall (i.e. forming long-term
    memories)
-   This makes certain actions easier to repeat (i.e. learning of a new
    skill or aptitude)

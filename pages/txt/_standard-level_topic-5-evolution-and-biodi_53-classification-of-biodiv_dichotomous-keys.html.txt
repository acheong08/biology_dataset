â€¢ Â Construction of dichotomous keys for use in identifying specimens

Â  Â Â 
A dichotomous key is a method of identification whereby groups of
organisms are divided into two categories repeatedly

-   With each sequential division, more information is revealed about
    the specific features of a particular organism
-   When the organism no longer shares its totality of selected
    characteristics with any organism, it has been identified

When using a dichotomous key to identify specimens it is preferable to
use immutable features (i.e. features that do not change)

-   Size, colouration and behavioural patterns may all vary amongst
    individuals and across lifetimes
-   Physical structures (e.g number of limbs) and biological processes
    (e.g. reproduction methods) make for better characteristics

Dichotomous keys are usually represented in one of two ways:

-   As a branching flowchart (diagrammatic representation)
-   As a series of paired statements laid out in a numbered sequence
    (descriptive representation)

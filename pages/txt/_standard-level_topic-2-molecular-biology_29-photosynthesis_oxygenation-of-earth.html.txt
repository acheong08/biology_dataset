â€¢ Â Changes to the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, oceans and rock deposition
due to photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 
Only one significant source of oxygen gas exists in the known universe
â€“ biological photosynthesis

-   Before the evolution of photosynthetic organisms, any free oxygen
    produced was chemically captured and stored

Approximately 2.3 billion years ago, photosynthetic organisms began to
saturate the environment with oxygen

-   This led to changes in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, oceans, rock
    deposition and biological life

Oceans

-   Earthâ€™s oceans initially had high levels of dissolved iron
    (released from the crust by underwater volcanic vents)
-   When iron reacts with oxygen gas it undergoes a chemical reaction to
    form an insoluble precipitate (iron oxide)
-   When the iron in the ocean was completely consumed, oxygen gas
    started accumulating in the atmosphere

Atmosphere

-   For the first 2 billion years after the Earth was formed, its
    atmosphere was anoxic (oxygen-free)
-   The current concentration of oxygen gas within the atmosphere is
    approximately 20%

Rock Deposition

-   The reaction between dissolved iron and oxygen gas created oceanic
    deposits called banded iron formations (BIFs)
-   These deposits are not commonly found in oceanic sedimentary rock
    younger than 1.8 billion years old
    -   This likely reflects the time when oxygen levels caused the near
        complete consumption of dissolved iron levels
-   As BIF deposition slowed in oceans, iron rich layers started to form
    on land due to the rise in atmospheric O₂ levels

Biological Life

-   Free oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobes and an increase in O₂
    levels may have wiped out many of these species
-   Conversely, rising O₂ levels was a critical determinant to the
    evolution of aerobically respiring organisms

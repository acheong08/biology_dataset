Understanding:

â€¢ Â Vesicles move materials within cells

Â  Â Â 
Materials destined for secretion are transported around the cell in
membranous containers called vesicles

Endoplasmic Reticulum

The endoplasmic reticulum is a membranous network that is responsible
for synthesising secretory materials

-   Rough ER is embedded with ribosomes and synthesises proteins
    destined for extracellular use
-   Smooth ER is involved in lipid synthesis and also plays a role in
    carbohydrate metabolism

Materials are transported from the ER when the membrane bulges and then
buds to create a vesicle surrounding the material

Golgi Apparatus

The vesicle is then transported to the Golgi apparatus and fuses to the
internal (cis) face of the complex

-   Materials move via vesicles from the internal cis face of the Golgi
    to the externally orientedÂ trans face
-   While within the Golgi apparatus, materials may be structurally
    modified (e.g. truncated, glycosylated, etc.)

Material sorted within the Golgi apparatus will either be secreted
externally or may be transported to the lysosome

Plasma Membrane

Vesicles containing materials destined for extracellular use will be
transported to the plasma membrane

The vesicle will fuse with the cell membrane and its materials will be
expelled into the extracellular fluid
Materials sorted by the Golgi apparatus may be either:

-   Released immediately into the extracellular fluid (constitutive
    secretion)
-   Stored within an intracellular vesicle for a delayed release in
    response to a cellular signal (regulatory secretion)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gene function can be studied using model organisms with similar
sequences

â€¢ Â Databases can be searched to compare new sequences with sequence
of known function in other organisms

Â  Â Â 
Comparative genomics is a field of bioinformatics in which the genome
sequence of different species is compared

-   Gene sequences are highly conserved and so can be identified by
    matching with known gene sequences in other species
-   Species with close evolutionary relationships typically shareÂ a
    higher degree of gene sequence homology

When an equivalent gene is discovered in another organism, it enables
scientists to use that organism to study gene function

-   There are greater ethical restraints involved in human
    experimentation, so using model organisms is a valid alternative
-   The most useful model organisms will be those with the highest
    degree of sequence similarity (e.g. bonobos = > 98%)
-   However, studying less related species may also be viable but
    present less ethical concerns (e.g. mouse = > 80%)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â EST is an expressed sequence tag that can be used to identify
potential genes

Â  Â Â 
One method of identifying conserved genes in different species is via
the use of anÂ expressed sequence tag (EST)

-   An EST is a short sequence of DNA (~200 â€“ 500 nucleotides) that is
    derived from the sequence of an expressed gene
-   An EST is generated by sequencing the terminal region of a cDNA
    construct (cDNA is copied from transcribed mRNA)

The EST is used to find a corresponding geneÂ by finding its matching
sequenceÂ within another organismâ€™s genome

-   The efficacy of this process will be dependent on the genome size
    and occurrence of introns (cDNA does notÂ copy introns)

Application:

â€¢ Â Discovery of genes by EST data mining

Â  Â Â 
EST data mining involves searching genome databases for sequences that
are a match to an expressed sequence tag

-   As as EST represents the terminal portion of a gene, an exact
    sequence match may denote a geneâ€™s presence and locationÂ 

EST sequences can be used to establish the function of novel genes:

-   If an EST sequence from a novel gene matches that of a known gene,
    it may indicate common functionality
-   If the EST returns no significant matches within a database, then no
    information can be gleaned regarding gene function

An example of an EST database which can be used for data mining gene
locations and functions is GenBank

-   In order to specifically search the GenBank database for expressed
    sequence tags, change the search parameter toÂ â€˜ESTâ€™

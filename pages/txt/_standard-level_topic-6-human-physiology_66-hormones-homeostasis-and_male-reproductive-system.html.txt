â€¢ Â Annotate diagrams of the maleÂ reproductive system to show names
of structures and their functions

Â  Â Â 
The male reproductive system includes all the organs responsible for the
production of sperm (the male gamete)

-   It also includes the organs that are involved in synthesising the
    semen in which the sperm is transported during copulation

Structures of the Male Reproductive System

The following structures all contribute to the production of sperm and
semen as part of the reproductive process in males

-   Structures are organised according to the path taken by sperm (from
    production to release)

Testis

-   The testis (plural: testes) is responsible for the production of
    sperm and testosterone (male sex hormone)

Epididymis

-   Site where sperm matures and develops the ability to be motile
    (i.e.Â â€˜swimâ€™) â€“ mature sperm is stored here until ejaculation

Vas Deferens

-   Long tube which conducts sperm from the testes to the prostate gland
    (which connects to the urethra) during ejaculation

Seminal Vesicle

-   Secretes fluid containing fructose (to nourish sperm), mucus (to
    protect sperm) and prostaglandin (triggers uterine contractions)

Prostate Gland

-   Secretes an alkaline fluid to neutralise vaginal acids (necessary to
    maintain sperm viability)

Urethra

-   Conducts sperm / semen from the prostate gland to the outside of the
    body via the penis (also used to convey urine)

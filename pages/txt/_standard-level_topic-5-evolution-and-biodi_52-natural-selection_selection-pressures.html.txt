Selection Pressures

Selection pressures are external agents which affect an organismâ€™s
ability to survive in a given environment

-   Selection pressures can be negative (decreases the occurrence of a
    trait) or positive (increases the proportion of a trait)
-   Selection pressures may not remain constant, leading to changes in
    what constitutes a beneficial adaptation

Types of selection pressures include:

-   Resource availability â€“ Presence of sufficient food, habitat
    (shelter / territory) and mates
-   Environmental conditions â€“ Temperature, weather conditions or
    geographical access
-   Biological factors â€“ Predators and pathogens (diseases)

Selection pressures can be density-dependent (affected by population
size) or density-independent (unaffected by population)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A nerve impulse is only initiated if a threshold potential is
reached

Â  Â Â 
Neurotransmitters bind to neuroreceptors on the post-synapticÂ membrane
of target cells and open ligand-gated ion channels

-   The opening of these channels cause small changes in membrane
    potential known as graded potentials

A nerve impulse is only initiated if a threshold potential is reached,
so as to open the voltage-gated ion channels within the axon

-   Excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenaline) cause
    depolarisation by opening ligand-gated sodium or calcium channels
-   Inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g. GABA) cause hyperpolarisation by
    opening ligand-gated potassium or chlorine channels

The combined action of all neurotransmitters acting on a target neuron
determines whether a threshold potential is reached

-   If overall there is more depolarisation than hyperpolarisation and a
    threshold potential is reached, the neuron will fire
-   If overall there is more hyperpolarisation than depolarisation and a
    threshold potential is not reached, the neuron will not fire

For a typicalÂ neuron, the threshold potential (required to open
voltage-gated ion channels) is approximately â€“55 mV

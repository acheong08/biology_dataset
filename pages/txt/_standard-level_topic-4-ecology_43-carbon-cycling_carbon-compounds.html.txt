â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide diffuses from the atmosphere or water into
autotrophs

â€¢ Â Autotrophs convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and other
carbon compounds

[carbon organic]

Autotrophs, such as all plants and algae, convert inorganic carbon
dioxide into organic compounds via photosynthesis

-   These organic compounds include the carbohydrates, lipids and
    proteins required by the organism for survival

Since autotrophs use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, the levels of
carbon dioxide within the organism should always be low

-   In other words, carbon dioxide should always be at a higher
    concentration in the atmosphere (or water)
-   This concentration gradient ensures that carbon dioxide will
    passively diffuse into the autotrophic organism as required
-   In aquatic producers, CO₂ can usually diffuse directly into the
    autotroph; whereas in terrestrial plants, diffusion occurs at
    stomata

Heterotrophs cannot synthesise their own organic molecules and instead
obtain carbon compounds via feeding

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is produced by respiration and diffuses out of
organisms into water or the atmosphere

Â  Â Â 

All organisms may produce the chemical energy (ATP) required to power
metabolic processes via the process of cell respiration

-   Cell respiration involves the breakdown of organic molecules (e.g.
    sugars) and produces carbon dioxide as a by-product
-   The build up of CO₂ in respiring tissues creates a concentration
    gradient, allowing it to be removed by passive diffusion

In autotrophs, the uptake of CO₂ by photosynthesis may at times be
balanced by the production of CO₂ by respiration

-   This is known as the compensation point, at which the net carbon
    dioxide assimilation is zero (intake = output)

Similarly, the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment will be
determined by the level of these two processes:

-   If there is more net photosynthesis than cell respiration occuring
    in the biosphere, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels should drop
-   If there is more net respiration than overall photosynthesis
    occuring, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels should increase

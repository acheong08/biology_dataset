Cell Checkpoints

Cell cycle checkpoints are mechanisms that ensure the fidelity and
continued viability of mitotic division in cells

Multiple checkpoints have been discovered, each with different specific
roles:

G₁ Checkpoint:

-   Determine appropriate growth conditions (sufficient nutrients, cell
    size, presence of growth factors, etc.)
-   Assess level of DNA damage (fromÂ ionising radiation or UV)Â 

G₂ Checkpoint:

-   Determine state of pre-mitotic cell (suitable cell size required for
    successful division)
-   Identify an replication faults (changes to DNA sequence will distort
    genetic fidelity in daughter cells)

Metaphase Checkpoint:

-   Ensure proper spindle assembly and correct attachment to centromeres
    (prevents non-disjunction events)

G0 Stage

Not all cells are continually replicating â€“ some cells may enter into
a non-dividing G₀ stage

These cells may either be dormant (quiescent) or ageing and
deteriorating (senescent)

Cells enter the G₀ phase from the G₁ phase; quiescent cells may re-enter
G₁ at a later time (senescent cells do not)

Normally, cells will only divide a finite time before reaching
senescence (a typical human cell will divide ~ 40 - 60 times)

Specialised cells will often permanently enter G₀, as differentiation
has prevented their capacity for further division Â 

Neurons are examples of cells that have been arrested in a G₀ state â€“
these cells are amitotic (cannot divide)

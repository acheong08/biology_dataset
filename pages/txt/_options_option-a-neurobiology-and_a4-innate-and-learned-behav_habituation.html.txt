Habituation

Habituation is a type of learned behaviour whereby the strength of a
response diminishes when the response is repeated

-   The response is usually an innate behaviour (e.g. reflex), rather
    than conditioned behaviours (which undergoÂ â€˜extinctionâ€™)

An example of habituation can be seen in the response of crows to the
presence of a scarecrow

-   Initially the birds will react to the scarecrow as if it is a valid
    threat (predator) and fly away
-   Eventually the birds will react less and not fly away â€“
    demonstrating habituation

Habituation can even be seen in the slime mould Physarum polycephalum,
which lacks any form of nervous system

-   When introduced by a bitter (yet harmless) barrier between its food
    source, the mould quickly learned to ignore the barrier
-   This acquired behaviour could even be passed on to naive mould cells
    when the two types of slime moulds fused

The opposite of habituation is sensitisation â€“ whereby the strength of
a response is amplified with repetition

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Brain metabolism requires large energy inputs

Â  Â Â 
The human brain consumes ~20% of the bodyâ€™s energy levels, despite
making up only ~2% of the bodyâ€™s mass

-   The brainâ€™s rate of energy consumption varies little, regardless
    of the level of physical exertion by the body

The large amounts of energy required by the brain are used to sustain
neurons and their processes

-   Energy is needed to maintain a resting potential whenÂ neurons are
    not firing (Na⁺/K⁺ pump uses ATP)
-   Energy is used to synthesise large numbers of neurotransmitters to
    facilitate neuronal communication

11.3 Â The Kidney and Osmoregulation

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
All animals excrete nitrogenous waste products and some
animals also balance water and solute concentrations

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   All animals are either osmoregulators or osmoconformers
-   The Malpighian tubule system in insects and the kidney carry out
    osmoregulation and the removal of nitrogenous wastes
-   The composition of blood in the renal artery is different from that
    in the renal vein
-   The ultrastructure of the glomerulus and Bowmanâ€™s capsule
    facilitate ultrafiltration
-   The proximal convoluted tubule selectively reabsorbs useful
    substances by active transport
-   The loop of Henle maintains hypertonic conditions in the medulla
-   ADH controls reabsorption of water in the collecting duct
-   The length of the loop of Henle is positively correlated with the
    need for water conservation in animals
-   The type of nitrogenous waste in animals is correlated with
    evolutionary history and habitat

Applications:

-   Consequences of dehydration andÂ overhydration
-   Treatment of kidney failure by hemodialysis or kidney transplant
-   Blood cells, glucose, proteins and drugs are detected in urinary
    tests

Skills:

-   Drawing and labelling a diagram of the human kidney
-   Annotation of diagrams of the nephron

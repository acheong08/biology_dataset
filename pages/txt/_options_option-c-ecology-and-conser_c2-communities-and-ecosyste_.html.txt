C2 Â Communities and Ecosystems

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Changes in community structure
affect and are affected by organisms

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Most species occupy different trophic levels in multiple food chains
-   A food web shows all the possible food chains in a community
-   The percentage of ingested energy converted to biomass is dependent
    upon the respiration rate
-   The type of stable ecosystem that will emerge in an area is
    predictable based on climate
-   In closed ecosystems energy but not matter is exchanged with the
    surroundings
-   DisturbanceÂ influxes the structure and rate of change within
    ecosystems

Applications:

-   Conversion ratio in sustainable food production practices
-   Consideration of one example how humans interfere with nutrient
    cycling

Skills:

-   Comparison of pyramids of energy from different ecosystems
-   Analysis of a climograph showing the relationshipÂ between
    temperature, rainfall and the type of ecosystem
-   Construction of Gersmehl diagrams to show the inter-relationships
    between nutrient stores and flows between taiga, desert and tropical
    rainforest
-   Analysis of data showing primary succession
-   Investigation into the effect of an environmental disturbance on an
    ecosystem

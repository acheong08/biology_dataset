Protein Expression

There are a number of ways via which protein expression patterns can
beÂ moderated:
1. Â Transcriptional control

-   Protein expression can be regulated by controlling to amount of
    transcription (less mRNA = less protein)
-   This level of control is achieved primarily through the coordinated
    effects of transcription factors and regulatory proteins

2. Â RNA processing control

-   This involves regulating the formation of mature mRNA in eukaryotes
    (e.g.Â 5â€™-capping and 3â€™-polyadenylation)
-   These processes are necessary to help direct the mRNA to the
    ribosome and prevent its premature degradation

3. Â RNA transport control

-   In eukaryotes, RNA must be transported out of the nucleus (through
    nuclear pores) in order to associate with the ribosome
-   If this transport is prevented, the related protein cannot by
    synthesised

4. Â Translational control

-   Protein expression can also be regulated by controlling the amount
    of translation
-   This may involve inhibiting ribosomal subunit assembly or actively
    targeting mRNA for degradation

5. Â Protein activity control

-   Protein expression patterns may also be affected by the rate of
    protein degradation
-   Post-translational modifications (such as ubiquitination or
    phosphorylation) may target proteins for destruction

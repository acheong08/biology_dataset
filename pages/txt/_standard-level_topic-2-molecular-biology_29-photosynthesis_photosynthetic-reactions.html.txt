Understanding:

â€¢ Â Oxygen is produced in photosynthesis from the photolysis of water

â€¢ Â Energy is needed to produce carbohydrates and other carbon
compounds from carbon dioxide

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthesis is a two step process:

-   The light dependent reactions convert light energy from the Sun into
    chemical energy (ATP)
-   The light independent reactions use the chemical energy to
    synthesise organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates)

Step 1: Â Light Dependent Reactions

-   Light is absorbed by chlorophyll, which results in the production of
    ATP (chemical energy)
-   Light is also absorbed by water, which is split (photolysis) to
    produce oxygen and hydrogen
-   The hydrogen and ATP are used in the light independent reactions,
    the oxygen is released from stomata as a waste product

Step 2: Â Light Independent Reactions

-   ATP and hydrogen (carried by NADPH) are transferred to the site of
    the light independent reactions
-   The hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide to form complex organic
    compounds (e.g. carbohydrates, amino acids, etc.)
-   The ATP provides the required energy to power these anabolic
    reactions and fix the carbon molecules together

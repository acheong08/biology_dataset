â€¢ Â William Harveyâ€™s discovery of the circulation of blood with the
heart acting as a pump

Â  Â Â 
Our modern understanding of circulatory system is based upon the
discoveries of 17^(th) century English physician, William Harvey

-   Harveyâ€™s findings were published in a book commonly called De Motu
    Cordis â€“ On the Motion of the Heart and Blood

Prior to Harveyâ€™s findings, scientists held to the antiquated views of
the Greek philosopher Galen, who believed that:

-   Arteries and veins were separate blood networks (except where they
    connected via invisible pores)
-   Veins were thought to pump natural blood (which was believed to be
    produced by the liver)
-   Arteries were thought to pump heat (produced by the heart) via the
    lungs (for cooling â€“ like bellows)

Based on some simple experiments and observations, Harvey instead
proposed that:

-   Arteries and veins were part of a single connected blood network (he
    did not predict the existence of capillaries however)
-   Arteries pumped blood from the heart (to the lungs and body tissues)
-   Veins returned blood to the heart (from the lungs and body tissues)

Circulation According to William Harvey

Understanding:

â€¢ Â There is a separate circulation for the lungs

Â  Â Â 
The human heart is a four chambered organ, consisting of two atria and
two ventricles

-   The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart
    is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles)
-   The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at
    high pressure via arteries

The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because
there are two distinct locations for blood transport

-   The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body
    (systemic circulation)
-   The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs
    (pulmonary circulation)

There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of
heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart)

-   The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall
    (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Pollutants become concentrated in the tissues of organisms at
higher trophic levels by biomagnification

Â  Â Â 
Biomagnification is the process in which chemical substances become more
concentrated at each trophic level

-   In contrast, bioaccumulation refers to the build up of a chemical
    substance in the tissues of a single organism

Biomagnification occurs because organisms at higher trophic levels must
consume more biomass to meet requirements

-   Energy transformations are only ~10% efficient, so higher order
    consumers must eat more to meet energy demands
-   This means higher order consumers will experience increased
    contamination from a chemical substance

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of data illustrating the causes and consequences of
biomagnification

Â  Â Â 
An example of a chemical substance which is biomagnified is DDT
(dichloroÂ diphenylÂ trichloroethane)

-   DDT is a chemical pesticide that is sprayed on crops and
    subsequently washed into waterways at low concentrations
-   It is fat soluble and is selectively retained within the tissues of
    an organism instead of being excrete

When DDT is sprayed on water to eliminate mosquito larvae, it is taken
up by algae and passed on to primary consumers

-   At each subsequent trophic level the concentration of DDT stored in
    the body increases due to increased food intake
-   Very high levels of DDT were discovered in birds that preyed on
    fish, and was found to interfere withÂ eggshell formation
-   Birds exposed to high levels of DDT were found to produce thinner
    shells, which decreased survival rates of fledglings

Application:

â€¢ Â Discussion of the trade-off between control of the malarial
parasite and DDT pollution

Â  Â Â 
DDT was widely employed as a chemical pesticide in the 1940s and 1950s
to control insect-borne diseases like malaria

-   Its use as an agricultural insecticide led to the complete
    eradication of malaria in many high socioeconomic world regions
-   It was less effective in low socioeconomic tropical regions where
    eradication programs could not be sustained

Eradication programs were curtailed by the World Health Organisation in
1969 over safety and environmental concerns

-   DDT can bioaccumulate to toxic levels and poses a significant threat
    to higher trophic levels (due to biomagnification)
-   Current interventions for malaria now focus on non-spraying
    strategies (such as the use of bednets soaked in insecticides)

Malaria versus DDT

Arguments for DDT Spraying:

-   DDT spraying is an affordable and effective means of killing
    mosquitos that carry disease (malaria, dengue fever, etc.)
-   Where the use of DDT has been discontinued, the incidence of malaria
    and associated deaths have increased
-   Health costs associated with the treatment of malaria are reduced
    when DDT spraying is implemented
-   Alternative strategies are not as cost-effective or successful

Arguments against DDT Spraying:

-   DDT spraying is associated with adverse health effects in humans
    (cancer, birth defects, reduced fertility, etc.)
-   DDT persists in the environment for long periods of time (more than
    15 years)
-   DDT is biomagnified in higher order consumers, which has adverse
    consequences on ecosystems

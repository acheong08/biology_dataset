Application:

â€¢ Â Recognition features of porifera, cnidaria,Â platyhelmintha,
annelida, mollusca, arthropoda and chordata

Â  Â Â 
The kingdom Animalia can be sub-divided into two main groups â€“
invertebrates (no backbone) and vertebrates (most chordata)

-   Examples of invertebrate phyla include porifera,
    cnidaria,Â platyhelmintha, annelida, mollusca and arthropoda
-   All vertebrates belong to the phylum chordata â€“ however not all
    chordata are vertebrates (e.g. invertebrate sea squirts)
-   These phyla can be differentiated according to a few key recognition
    features

[porifera icon]

Porifera

-   No body symmetry (asymmetrical)
-   No mouth or anus (have pores to facilitate the circulation of
    material)
-   May have silica or calcium carbonate based spicules for structural
    support
-   Examples include sea sponges

[cnidaria icon]

Cnidaria

-   Have radial symmetry
-   Have a mouth but no anus (single entrance body cavity)
-   May have tentacles with stinging cells for capturing and disabling
    prey
-   Examples include jellyfish, sea anemones and coral

[platyhelminth icon]

Platyhelmintha

-   Have bilateral symmetry
-   Have a mouth but no anus (single entrance body cavity)
-   Have a flattened body shape to increase SA:Vol ratio and may be
    parasitic
-   Examples include tapeworms and planaria

[annelid icon]

Annelida

-   Have bilateral symmetry
-   Have a separate mouth and anus
-   Body composed of ringed segments with specialisation of segments
-   Examples include earthworms and leeches

[mollusc icon]

Mollusca

-   Have bilaterial symmetry
-   Have a separate mouth and anus
-   Body composed of a visceral mass, a muscular foot and a mantle (may
    produce shell)
-   Examples include snails, slugs, octopi, squid and bivalves (e.g.
    clams)

[arthropod icon]

Arthropoda

-   Have bilateral symmetry
-   Have a separate mouth and anus
-   Have jointed body sections / appendages and have a hard exoskeleton
    (chitin)
-   Examples include insects, crustaceans, spiders, scorpions and
    centipedes

[chordate icon]

Chordata

-   Have bilateral symmetry
-   Have a separate mouth and anus
-   Have a notochord and a hollow, dorsal nerve tube for at least some
    period of their life cycle
-   Examples include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish (also
    invertebrate seaÂ squirts)

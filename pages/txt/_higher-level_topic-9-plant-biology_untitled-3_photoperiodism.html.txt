Understanding:

â€¢ Â The switch to flowering is a response to the length of light and
dark periods in many plants

Â  Â Â 
The purpose of flowering is to enable the plant to sexually reproduce
via pollination, fertilisation and seed dispersal

-   Consequently, flowers need to bloom when pollinators are most active
    and abundant â€“ this is dependent on seasons
-   Some plants bloom in long day conditions (summer), whereas other
    plants bloom in short day conditions (autumn / winter)

The critical factor responsible for flowering is the length of light and
dark periods, which is detected by phytochromes

Phytochromes

Phytochromes are leaf pigments which are used by the plant to detect
periods of light and darkness

-   The response of the plant to the relative lengths of light and
    darkness is called photoperiodismÂ 

Phytochromes exist in two forms â€“ an active form and an inactive form:

-   The inactive form of phytochrome (P_(r)) is converted into the
    active form when it absorbs red light (~660 nm)
-   The active form of phytochrome (P_(fr)) is broken down into the
    inactive form when itÂ absorbs far red light (~725 nm)
-   Additionally, the active form will gradually revert to the inactive
    form in the absence of light (darkness reversion)

Because sunlight contains more red light than moonlight, the active form
is predominant during the day

-   Similarly, as the active form is reverted in darkness, the inactive
    form is predominant during the night

Photoperiodism

Only the active form of phytochrome (P_(fr)) is capable of causing
flowering, however its action differs in certain types of plants

-   Plants can be classed as short-day or long-day plants, however the
    critical factor in determiningÂ their activity is night length

Short-day plants flower when the days are short â€“ hence require the
night period to exceed a critical length

-   In short-day plants,Â P_(fr)Â inhibits flowering and hence flowering
    requires low levels ofÂ P_(fr)Â (i.e. resulting from long nights)

Long-day plants flower when the days are long â€“ hence require the
night period to be less than a critical length

-   In long-day plants,Â P_(fr)Â activatesÂ flowering and hence
    flowering requires high levels ofÂ P_(fr)Â (i.e. resulting from
    short nights)

Application:

â€¢ Â Methods used to induce short-day plants to flower out of season

Â  Â Â 
Horticulturalists can manipulate the flowering of short-day and long-day
plants by controlling the exposure of light

-   The critical night length required for a flowering response must be
    uninterrupted in order to be effective

Long-day plants require periods of darkness to be less than an
uninterrupted critical length

-   These plants will traditionally not flower during the winter and
    autumn months when night lengths are long
-   Horticulturalists can trigger flowering in these plants by exposing
    the plant to a light source during the night
-   Carnations are an example of a long-day plant

Short-day plants require periods of darkness to be greater than
anÂ uninterrupted critical length

-   These plants will traditionally not flower during the summer months
    when night lengths are short
-   Horticulturalists can trigger flowering in these plants by covering
    the plant with an opaque black cloth for ~12 hours a day
-   Crysanthemums are an example of a short-day plant

Virus Classification

Viruses do not share the same classification system as organisms because
they are not considered to be living

-   Viruses do not have metabolism and can only reproduce using the
    cellular machinery of an infected host cell

Viruses are classified mainly according to phenotypic characteristics,
including:

-   Morphology (e.g. helical, icosohedral, spherical, complex)
-   Nucleic acid type (e.g. DNA = adenovirus ; RNA = retrovirus)
-   Method of viral replication (e.g. lytic vs lysogenic cycles)
-   Host organisms (e.g. bacteriophages)
-   Types of disease caused (e.g. influenza virus, HIV)

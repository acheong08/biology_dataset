Types of RNA

RNA functions to transfer genetic instructions from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, where the information is decoded

There are three main types of RNA which cooperate to complete this goal:

-   Messenger RNAÂ (mRNA)Â â€“ a transcript copy of a gene which encodes
    a specific polypeptide
-   Transfer RNAÂ (tRNA)Â â€“ carries the polypeptide subunits (amino
    acids) to the organelle responsible for synthesis (ribosome)
-   Ribosomal RNAÂ (rRNA)Â â€“ a primary component of the ribosome and
    is responsible for its catalytic activity

Additionally, cells may produce other variants of non-coding RNA to
support and regulate the expression of genes:

-   Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) â€“ a component of the spliceosome
    (involved in splicing of introns)
-   Short interfering RNA (siRNA) â€“ moderates gene expression levels
    via RNA interference (RNAi)

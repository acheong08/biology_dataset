Understanding:

â€¢ Â Marker genes are used to indicate successful uptake

Â  Â Â 
Following gene delivery, scientists must identify which cells have
successfully taken up the recombinant DNA

-   These transgenic cells can then be cultured and developed to form
    transgenic crops for agricultural use

Marker genes are typically included as part of the recombinant construct
to indicate successful uptake

-   Most commonly, marker genes will code for resistance to a particular
    antibiotic
-   Plant cells are grown on media containing the antibiotic and only
    the transgenic cells will be able to surviveÂ

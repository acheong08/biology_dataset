Understandings:

-   Mitosis is division of the nucleus into two genetically identical
    daughter nuclei
-   Chromosomes condense by supercoiling during mitosis
-   Interphase is a very active phase of the cell cycle with many
    processes occurring in the nucleus and cytoplasm
-   Cytokinesis occurs after mitosis and is different in plant and
    animal cells
-   Cyclins are involved in the control of the cell cycle
-   Mutagens, oncogenes and metastasis are involved in the development
    of primary and secondary tumours

Applications:

-   The correlation between smoking and incidence of cancers

Skills:

-   Identification of phases of mitosis in cells viewed with a
    microscope or in a micrograph
-   Determination of a mitotic index from a micrograph

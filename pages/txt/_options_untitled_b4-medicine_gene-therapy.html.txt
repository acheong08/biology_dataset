Understanding:

â€¢ Â Viral vectors can be used in gene therapy

Â  Â  Â Â 
Gene therapyÂ is the insertion of genes into an individualâ€™s cells to
treat hereditary diseases by replacing defective alleles

-   It differs from standard transgenic practices in that it is intended
    to transform existing organisms rather than create new ones
-   Viral vectors are typically used, due to their ability to integrate
    DNA into the hostâ€™s genome
-   The process involves removing cells from a patient and using a viral
    vector to introduce aÂ functional copy of the defective gene
-   When the cells are transplanted back into the patient, they should
    begin expressing the missing protein to restore normal healthÂ

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of viral vectors in the treatment of Severe Combined
Immunodeficiency (SCID)

Â  Â  Â Â 
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder caused by
the absence of functional T lymphocytes

-   This impairs the adaptive immune system and prevents antibody
    production, resulting in a deficient immune response
-   Individuals with SCID are unable to respond to trivial infections
    and opportunistic infections can prove to be fatal

SCID is commonly caused by an autosomal recessive condition known as
adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency

-   This condition results from an inability to produce the enzyme ADA,
    which is needed to safely break down a toxic chemical
-   Immature lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to this toxic
    chemical and consequently fail to mature (leading to SCID)
-   Individuals who have undergone gene therapy have shown steady
    increases in cellular ADA levels following the procedure

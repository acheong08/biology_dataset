Extinction

Extinction is the total cessation of a species or higher taxon level,
reducing biodiversity

-   It can result gradually, as one population of organisms
    progressively evolve into something else (phyletic extinction)
-   Alternatively, a species may not leave any
    identifiableÂ descendentsÂ and simply cease to exist (abrupt
    extinction)

Extinction can be caused by a range of factors, including habitat
degradation, predation, disease or natural disaster

-   Over 99% of species that have ever existed on Earth are now extinct

Mass extinction events are categorised by an unusually high number of
species dying out in a relatively short period

-   There have been five commonly recognised mass extinction events in
    the history of the Earth

Mass Extinction Events

1. Ordovicianâ€“Silurian mass extinction (~450 million years ago):
Approximately 60 â€“ 70% of all species wiped out

2. Late Devonian mass extinction (~370 million years ago): Over 75% of
all species wiped out

3. Permian mass extinction (~250 million years ago): Roughly 96% of all
species were wiped out

4. Triassic mass extinction (~200 million years ago): Over 50% of all
species were wiped out

5. Cretaceous mass extinction (~65 million years ago): Approximately 80%
of all species wiped out

â€¢ Â Structure of cardiac muscle cells allows propagation of stimuli
through the heart wall

Â  Â Â 
The heart is composed of cardiac muscle cells which have specialised
features that relates to their function:

-   Cardiac muscle cells contract without stimulation by the central
    nervous system (contraction is myogenic)
-   Cardiac muscle cells are branched, allowing for faster signal
    propagation and contraction in three dimensions
-   Cardiac muscles cells are not fused together, but are connected by
    gap junctions at intercalated discs
-   Cardiac muscle cells have more mitochondria, as they are more
    reliant on aerobic respiration than skeletalÂ muscle

These structural features contribute to the unique functional properties
of the cardiac tissue:

-   Cardiac muscle has a longer period of contraction and refraction,
    which is needed to maintain a viable heart beat
-   The heart tissue does not become fatigued (unlike skeletal muscle),
    allowing for continuous, life long contractions
-   The interconnected network of cells is separated between atria and
    ventricles, allowing them to contract separately

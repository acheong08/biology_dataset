Understanding:

â€¢ Â The structure of the mitochondrion is adapted to the function it
performs

Â  Â 
Mitochondria are theÂ â€˜powerplantsâ€™Â of the cell â€“ synthesising
large amounts of ATP via aerobic respiration

-   All eukaryotic cells possess mitochondria â€“ aerobic prokaryotes
    use the cell membrane to perform oxidative phosphorylation

Mitochondria are thought to have once been independent prokaryotes that
were internalised by eukaryotes via endosymbiosis

-   They have a double membrane structure (due to vesicular coating as
    part of the endocytotic process)
-   They have their own DNA (circular and naked) and ribosomes (70S)
-   Their metabolic processes are susceptible to certain antibiotics

The structure of the mitochondrion is adapted to the function it
performs:

-   Outer membrane â€“ the outer membrane contains transport proteins
    that enable the shuttling of pyruvate from the cytosol
-   Inner membrane â€“ contains the electron transport chain and ATP
    synthase (used for oxidative phosphorylation)Â 
-   Cristae â€“ the inner membrane is arranged into folds (cristae) that
    increase the SA:Vol ratio (more available surface)
-   Intermembrane space â€“ small space between membranes maximises
    hydrogen gradient upon proton accumulation
-   Matrix â€“ central cavity that contains appropriate enzymes and a
    suitable pH for the Krebs cycle to occur

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram of a mitochondrion to indicate the
adaptations to its function

Â  Â 
Electron micrographs of a mitochondrion may differ in appearance
depending on where the cross-section occurs

Typically, mitochondrial diagrams should display the following features:

-   Usually sausage-shaped in appearance (though will appear more
    rounded in perpendicular cross-sections)
-   Inner membrane contains many internal protrusions (cristae)
-   Intermembrane space is very small (allows for a more rapid
    generation of a proton motive force)
-   Ribosomes and mitochondrial DNA are usually not visible at standard
    resolutions and magnifications

Application:

â€¢ Â Electron tomography used to produce images of active mitochondria

Â  Â  Â 
Electron tomography is a technique by which the 3-dimensional internal
structure of a sample can be modelled

-   Samples are repeatedly imaged using a transmission electron
    microscope
-   Following each image, the sample is tilted to a different angle
    relative to the electron beam
-   The images are then compiled and used to computationally reconstruct
    a 3-D representation (called a tomogram)

When dealing with biological materials, samples are first prepared by
either fixing and dehydrating or freezing (cryogenics)

-   This stabilises the biological structures and prevents aqueous
    contents (i.e. water) from expanding and exploding

Using electron tomography, the following features of active mitochondria
have been identified:

-   The cristae are continuous with the internal mitochondrial membrane
-   The intermembrane space is of a consistent width thoughout the
    entire mitochondrion
-   The relative shape, position and volume of the cristae can change in
    active mitochondria

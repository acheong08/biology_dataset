selection

Â  Â Â 
Natural selection is the change in the composition of a gene pool in
response to a differentially selective environmental pressure

-   The frequency of one particular phenotype in relation to another
    will be a product of the type of selection that is occurring

Stabilising Selection

-   Where an intermediate phenotype is favoured at the expense of both
    phenotypic extremes
-   This results in the removal of extreme phenotypes (phenotypic
    distribution becomes centrally clustered to reflect homogeneity)
-   Operates when environmental conditions are stable and competition is
    low
-   An example of stabilising selection is human birth weights (too
    large = birthing complications ; too small = risk of infant
    mortality)

Directional Selection

-   Where one phenotypic extreme is selected at the cost of the other
    phenotypic extreme
-   This causes the phenotypic distribution to clearly shift in one
    direction (towards the beneficial extreme)
-   Operates in response to gradual or sustained changes in
    environmental conditions
-   Directional selection will typically be followed by stabilising
    selection once an optimal phenotype has been normalised
-   An example of directional selection is the development of antibiotic
    resistance in bacterial populations

Disruptive Selection

-   Where both phenotypic extremes are favoured at the expense of the
    intermediate phenotypic ranges
-   This causes the phenotypic distribution to deviate from the centre
    and results in a bimodal spread
-   This occurs when fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g. seasons)
    favour the presence of two different phenotypes
-   Continued separation of phenotypic variants may eventually split the
    population into two distinct sub-populations (speciation)
-   An example of disruptive selection is the proliferation of black or
    white moths in regions ofÂ sharply contrasting colour extremes

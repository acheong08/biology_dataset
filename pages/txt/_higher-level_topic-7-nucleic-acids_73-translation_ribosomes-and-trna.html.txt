â€¢ Â The use of molecular visualisation software to analyse the
structure of eukaryotic ribosomesÂ 

Â  Â  and a tRNA molecule

Ribosomes

-   Ribosomes are made of protein (for stability) and ribosomal RNA (for
    catalytic activity)
-   They consist of a large and small subunit:
    -   The small subunit contains an mRNA binding site
    -   The large subunit contains three tRNA binding sites â€“ an
        aminoacyl (A) site, a peptidyl (P) site and an exit (E) site
-   Ribosomes can be found either freely floating in the cytosol or
    bound to the rough ER (in eukaryotes)
-   Ribosomes differ in size in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (prokaryotes
    = 70S ; eukaryotes = 80S)

Transfer RNA (tRNA)

tRNA molecules fold into a cloverleaf structure with four key regions:

-   The acceptor stem (3â€™-CCA) carries an amino acid
-   The anticodon associates with the mRNA codon (via complementary base
    pairing)
-   The T arm associates with the ribosome (via the E, P and A binding
    sites)
-   The D arm associates with the tRNA activating enzyme (responsible
    for adding the amino acid to the acceptor stem)

Molecular Visualisation

To view the structure of a ribosome or a tRNA molecule via an
interactive pop-up, click on the name of the structure below:

* Hint:Â For the ribosome, select nucleic acids and then colour
structure by chain to identify the two subunits and three tRNA binding
sitesÂ

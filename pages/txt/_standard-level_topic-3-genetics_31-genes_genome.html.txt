Understanding:

â€¢ Â The genome is the whole of the genetic information of an organism

Â  Â Â 
The genome is the totality of genetic information of a cell, organism or
organelle

-   This includes all genes as well as non-coding DNA sequences (e.g.
    introns, promoters, short tandem repeats, etc.)

The human genome consists of:

-   46 chromosomes (barring aneuploidy)
-   ~3 billion base pairs
-   ~21,000 genes

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The entire base sequence of human genes was sequenced in the Human
Genome Project

Â  Â Â 
The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international cooperative venture
established to sequence the human genome

-   The HGP showed that humans share the majority of their sequence,
    with short nucleotide polymorphisms contributing diversity

The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 lead to many
outcomes:

-   Mapping â€“ The number, location, size and sequence of human genes
    is now established
-   Screening â€“ This has allowed for the production of specific gene
    probes to detect sufferers and carriers of genetic diseases
-   Medicine â€“ The discovery of new proteins have lead to improved
    treatments (pharmacogenetics and rational drug design)
-   Ancestry â€“ Comparisons with other genomes have provided insight
    into the origins, evolution and migratory patterns of man

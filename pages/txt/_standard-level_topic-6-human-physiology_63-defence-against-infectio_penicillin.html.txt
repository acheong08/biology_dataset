Application:

â€¢ Â Florey and Chainâ€™s experiments to test penicillin on bacterial
infections in mice

Â  Â Â 
The first chemical compound found to have antibiotic properties was
penicillin, which was identified by Alexander Fleming in 1928

-   The discovery of penicillin was a fortuitous accident, resulting
    from the unintended contamination of a dish containing S. aureus
-   A Penicillium mould began to grow on the plate and a halo of
    inhibited bacterial growth was observed around the mould
-   Fleming concluded that the mould was releasing a
    substanceÂ (penicillin) that was killing the nearby bacteriaÂ

Medical Applications

The medical applications of penicillin as an antibiotic were
demonstrated by an Australian scientist, Sir Howard Florey, in 1940

-   Working with another scientist (Ernst Chain) and a team of
    researchers, Florey tested penicillin on infected mice
-   Eight mice were injected with hemolytic streptococci and four of
    these mice were subsequently injected with doses of penicillin
-   The untreated mice died of bacterial infection while those treated
    with penicillin all survived â€“ demonstrating its antibiotic
    potential

Historical Significance

In 1945, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and Alexander Fleming were
collectively awarded the Nobel Prize for MedicineÂ 

-   Following the chemical determination of penicillin structure in
    1945, several synthetic derivatives have since been created
-   These derivatives (including methicillin) offer many benefits
    including a broader spectrum, more stability and greater tolerance

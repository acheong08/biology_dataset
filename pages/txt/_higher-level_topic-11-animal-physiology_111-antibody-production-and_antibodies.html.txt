Understanding:

â€¢ Â Plasma cells secrete antibodies

â€¢ Â Antibodies aid in the destruction of pathogens

Â  Â Â 
When a specific B lymphocyte is activated following antigen
presentation, it divides into plasma cells and memory cells

-   Plasma cells are short-lived and secrete high numbers of antibodies
    that are specific to a particular antigen
-   Plasma cells will secrete ~ 2,000 antibody molecules per second into
    the bloodstream for roughly 4 to 5 days

Antibodies aid in the destruction of pathogens by a number of different
mechanisms:

[panic]

â€¢ Â Precipitation â€“ Soluble pathogens become insoluble and
precipitateÂ 

â€¢ Â Agglutination â€“ Cellular pathogens become clumped for easier
Â removalÂ 

â€¢ Â Neutralisation â€“ Antibodies may occlude pathogenic regions (e.g.
exotoxins)

â€¢ Â Inflammation â€“ Antibodies may trigger an inflammatory response
within the body

â€¢ Â Complement activation â€“ Complement proteins perforate membranes
(cell lysis)
Mnemonic: Â PANIC

Collectively, the action of antibodies enhance the immune system by
aiding the detection and removal of pathogens by the phagocytic
leukocytes of the innate immune system (macrophages)

-   The constant region of antibodies can be recognised by macrophages,
    improving pathogen identification (opsonisation)
-   The macrophages can now engulf and eliminate pathogens more
    efficiently, reducing disease symptoms

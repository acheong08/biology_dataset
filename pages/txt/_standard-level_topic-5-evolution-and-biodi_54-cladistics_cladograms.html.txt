â€¢ Â Analysis of cladograms to deduce evolutionary relationships

Â  Â Â 
Constructed cladograms all typically share certain key features:

-   Root â€“ The initial ancestor common to all organisms within the
    cladogram (incoming line shows it originates from a larger clade)
-   Nodes â€“ Each node corresponds to a hypothetical common ancestor
    thatÂ speciated to give rise to two (or more) daughter taxa
-   Outgroup â€“ The most distantly related species in the cladogram
    which functions as a point of comparison and reference group
-   Clades â€“ A common ancestor and all of its descendants (i.e. a node
    and all of its connected branches)

Key Features of a Cladogram

Constructing Cladograms

Cladograms can be constructed based on either a comparison of
morphological (structural) features or molecular evidence

-   Historically, structural features were used to construct cladograms,
    but molecular evidence is now more commonly used

1. Â Using Structural Evidence

Step 1: Â Organise selected organisms according to defined
characteristics

-   Use characteristics that are developmentally fixed (i.e. innate) and
    not influenced by environmental pressures

Step 2: Â Sequentially order organisms according to shared
characteristics to construct a cladogram

-   Grouping of organisms may be facilitated by constructing a Venn
    diagram prior to developing a cladogram
-   Each characteristic will be represented by a node, with more common
    characteristics representing earlier nodes
-   The species with the least number of characteristics in common will
    represent theÂ outgroup (establishes baseline properties)

2. Â Using Molecular Evidence

Step 1: Â Select a gene or protein common to a range of selected
organisms

-   Examples of molecules which are ubiquitously found in many animals
    include haemoglobin and cytochrome c

Step 2: Â Copy the molecular sequence (DNA or amino acid) for each of
the selected organisms

-   Use online databases such as Genbank orÂ Ensembl to identify
    relevant DNA or amino acid sequences
-   Sequences can be collated in a Word document and then saved as a
    document in plain text format (.txt)Â 
-   Before each sequence, designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)

Step 3: Â Run a multiple alignment to compare molecular sequences (DNA
or amino acid)

-   Multiple alignment software compares DNA or protein sequences for
    similarities and differences
-   Closely related species are expected to have a higher degree of
    similarity in their molecular sequence
-   Clustal Omega is a free online tool that will align multiple DNA or
    amino acid sequences for comparison

Step 4: Â Generate a phylogeny tree (cladogram) from multiple alignment
data

-   Clustal Omega can generate branched phylograms after a sequence
    alignment is completed (selectÂ â€˜Phylogenetic Treeâ€™)
-   Below is a plain text file that can be uploaded to compare amino
    acid sequences from different species:
    -   HBA Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin alpha chain (amino acid sequence) from
        various species

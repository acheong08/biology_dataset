â€¢ Â Use of databases to identify potential new anti-malarial drugs

Â  Â Â 
Malaria is a disease caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus
Plasmodium

-   The life cycle of the parasite requires both a human and mosquito
    host â€“ hence the disease is transmitted via mosquito bites
-   The maturation and development of the parasite in both human and
    mosquito host is coordinated by specific enzymes
-   By targeting these enzymes for inhibition, new anti-malarial drugs
    and medications can be produced

Scientists have sequenced the genome of infectious species of Plasmodium
and used it to determine the parasiteâ€™s proteome

-   From the proteome, enzymes involved in parasitic metabolism have
    been identified as potential targets for inhibition

These enzymes may be screened against a bioinformaticÂ database of
chemicals to identify potential enzyme inhibitors

-   Once a promising compound is identified, it may be chemically
    modified to improve its binding affinity and lower its toxicity
-   In one particular study, over 300,000 chemicals were screened to
    identify 19 new chemicals that might function as inhibitorsÂ 

An alternative method by which potential new anti-malarial medications
can be synthesised is via rational drug design

-   Rational drug design involves using computer modelling techniques to
    invent a compound that will function as an inhibitor
-   Using combinatorial chemistry, a compound is synthesised that is
    complementary to the active site of the target enzyme

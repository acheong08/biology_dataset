Understanding:

â€¢ Â Impulses caused by sound perception are transmitted to the brain
via the auditory nerve

Â  Â Â 
Sound travels as pressure waves in the air, which travel down the
auditory canal and cause the eardrum to vibrate

-   The degree of vibration of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) will
    depend on the frequency and amplitude of the sound wave

The eardrum transfers the vibrations via the bones of the middle ear
(the ossicles) to the oval window of the cochlea

-   The function of these bones is to amplify the vibrations from the
    eardrum (can increase magnification by ~ 20 times)

The vibration of the oval window causes fluid within the cochlea to be
displaced â€“ this displacement is detected by hair cells

-   Activation of these hair cells generates nerve impulses which are
    transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Structures in the middle ear transmit and amplify sound

Â  Â Â 
The middle ear is separated from the outer ear by the eardrum and the
inner ear by the oval window

-   It is an air-filled chamber that houses three small bones
    (collectively called the ossicles)

The bones of the middle ear are individually called the malleus
(hammer), incus (anvil) and stapes (stirrup)

-   The malleus is in contact with the eardrum and the stapes contacts
    the oval window (while the incus connects the two)

The function of the ossicles is to amplify the sound vibrations by
acting like levers to reduce the force distribution

-   Sound travelling through air is mostly reflected when contacted by a
    liquid medium (due to the incompressibility of fluids)
-   The amplification of sound by the ossicles allows the vibrational
    pressure to pass to the cochlear fluid with very little lossÂ 
-   The oval window is smaller than the ear drum, which also assists in
    amplifying the sound energy

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Sensory hairs of the cochlea detect sounds at specific wavelengths

Â  Â Â 
The cochlea is a fluid-filled spiral tube within the inner ear that
converts sound vibrations into nerve impulses

-   Displacement of fluid by sound vibrations activates sensory hair
    cells within the spiral part of the cochlea (organ of Corti)

Hair cells are mechanoreceptors that possess tiny hair-like extensions
called stereocilia

-   The cilia on hair cells vary in length and will each resonate to a
    different frequency of sound (i.e. specific wavelengths)

When the stereocilia are moved by the cochlear fluid, the hair cell will
depolarise to generate a nerve impulse

-   The nerve impulse will be transmitted via the auditory nerve to the
    auditory centres of the brain
-   The kinetic movement of the cochlear fluid (and stereocilia motion)
    is dissipated by the vibration of the round window

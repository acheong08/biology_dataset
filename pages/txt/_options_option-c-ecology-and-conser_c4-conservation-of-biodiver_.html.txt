C4 Â Conservation of Biodiversity

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Entire communities need to be conserved
in order to preserve biodiversity

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   An indicator species is an organism used to assess a specific
    environmental condition
-   Relative numbers of indicator species can be used to calculate the
    value of a biotic index
-   In situ conservation may require active management of nature
    reserves or national parks
-   Ex situ conservation is the preservation of species outside their
    natural habitats
-   Biogeographic factors affect species diversity
-   Richness and evenness are components of biodiversity

Applications:

-   Case study of the captive breeding and reintroduction of an
    endangered animal species
-   Analysis of the impact of biogeographic factors on diversity limited
    to island size and edge effects

Skills:

-   Analysis of the biodiversity of two local communities using
    Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal index of diversity

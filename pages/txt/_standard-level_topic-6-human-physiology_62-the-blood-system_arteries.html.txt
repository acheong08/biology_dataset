Understanding:

â€¢ Â Arteries convey blood at high pressure from the ventricles to the
tissues of the body

â€¢ Â Arteries have muscle cells and elastic fibres in their walls

Â  Â Â 
Structure and Function

The function of arteries is to convey blood at high pressureÂ from the
heart ventricles to the tissues of the body and lungs

To this end, arteries have a specialised structure in order to
accomplish this task:

-   They have a narrow lumen (relative to wall thickness) to maintain a
    high blood pressure (~ 80 â€“ 120 mmHg)
-   They have a thick wall containing an outer layer of collagen to
    prevent the artery from rupturing under the high pressure
-   The arterial wall also contains an inner layer of muscle and elastic
    fibres to help maintain pulse flow (it can contract and stretch)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The muscle and elastic fibres assist in maintaining blood pressure
between pump cycles

Â  Â Â 
Flow of Blood

Blood is expelled from the heart upon ventricular contraction and flows
through the arteries in repeated surges called pulses

-   This blood flows at a high pressure and the muscle and elastic
    fibres assist in maintaining this pressure between pumps

The muscle fibres help to form a rigid arterial wall that is capable of
withstanding the high blood pressure without rupturing

-   Muscle fibres can also contract to narrow the lumen, which increases
    the pressure between pumps and helps to maintain blood pressure
    throughout the cardiac cycle

The elastic fibres allow the arterial wall to stretch and expand upon
the flow of a pulse through the lumen

-   The pressure exerted on the arterial wall is returned to the blood
    when the artery returns to its normal size (elastic recoil)
-   The elastic recoil helps to push the blood forward through the
    artery as well as maintain arterial pressure between pump cycles

Membrane Fluidity

Cell membranes are fluid, meaning they are not fixed in position and can
adopt amorphous shapes

Membrane fluidity is enhanced at higher temperatures and is also
affected by the composition of the bilayer

Phospholipid Structure

Phospholipids may vary in the length and relative saturation of the
fatty acid tails

-   Shorter fatty acid tails will increase fluidity as they are less
    viscous and more susceptible to changes in kinetic energy
-   Lipid chains with double bonds (unsaturated fatty acids) have kinked
    hydrocarbon tails that are harder to pack togetherÂ

Cholesterol

Cholesterol acts as a bi-directional regulator of membrane fluidity

-   At high temperatures it stabilises the membrane and raises the
    melting pointÂ 
-   At low temperatures it intercalates between the phospholipids and
    prevents clustering

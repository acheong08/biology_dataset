X-Inactivation

X-inactivation is the process by which one of the two X chromosomes
present in females is inactivated

-   This ensures that females do not produce twice as many X-linked gene
    proteins as males (who possess one X chromosome)

The silenced X chromosome is packaged as transcriptionally inactive
heterochromatin, forming a structure called a Barr body

-   Once an X chromosome is inactivated, it will remain permanently
    inactive in the cell (and all cells derived from it)

X-inactivation occurs randomly in mammals, meaning both X chromosomes
may be active in different cells

-   This allows for a heterozygous phenotype to occur in the female as a
    whole

3.4 Â Inheritance

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The inheritance of genes follows patterns

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Mendel discovered the principles of inheritance with experiments in
    which large numbers of pea plants were crossed
-   Gametes are haploid so contain only one allele of each gene
-   The two alleles of each gene separate into different haploid
    daughter nuclei during meiosis
-   Fusion of gametes results in diploid zygotes with two alleles of
    each gene that may be the same allele or different alleles
-   Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles but
    co-dominant alleles have joint effects
-   Many genetic diseases in humans are due to recessive alleles of
    autosomal genes, although some genetic diseases are due to dominant
    or co-dominant alleles
-   Some genetic diseases are sex linked
-   The pattern of inheritance is different with sex-linked genes due to
    their location on sex chromosomes
-   Many genetic diseases have been identified in humans but most are
    very rare
-   Radiation and mutagenic chemicals increase the mutation rate and can
    cause genetic diseases and cancer

Applications:

-   Inheritance of ABOÂ blood groups
-   Red-green colour blindness and haemophilia as examples of sex-linked
    inheritance
-   Inheritance of cystic fibrosis and Huntingtonâ€™s disease
-   Consequences of radiation after nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and
    accident at Chernobyl

Skill:

-   Construction of Punnett grids for predicting the outcomes of
    monohybrid genetic crosses
-   Comparison of predicted and actual outcomes of genetic crosses using
    real data
-   Analysis of pedigree charts to deduce the patterns of inheritance of
    genetic diseases

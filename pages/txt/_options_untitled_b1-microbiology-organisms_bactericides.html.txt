â€¢ Â Experiments showing zone of inhibition of bacterial growth by
bactericides in sterile bacterial cultures

Â  Â Â 
Bactericides are substances which kill bacteria â€“ they include certain
types of disinfectants, antiseptics and antibiotics

-   Whereas bactericidal agents will kill bacteria, bacteriostatic
    agents function by slowing their growth and reproduction

The efficacy of a particular bactericide can be tested by examining its
effect on bacterial growth in a sterile bacterial culture

-   If a bactericide is effective against a particular bacterial strain,
    there will be no growth around the agent (zone of inhibition)
-   The larger the zone of inhibition, the more effective the
    bactericidal agent is at killing the bacterial strain

The zone of inhibition will also be affected by the solubility of the
bactericide (i.e. fast diffusion rate = large zone of inhibition)

-   This is an important consideration when testing multiple
    bactericides on the same growth medium

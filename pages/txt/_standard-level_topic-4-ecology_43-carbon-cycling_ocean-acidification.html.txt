Ocean Acidification

The ocean is the largest active carbon sink on Earth, responsible for
absorbing roughly a third of all human-produced CO₂

-   Some CO₂ may remain as dissolved gas within the water, however the
    majority will combine with water to form carbonic acid
-   The solubility of CO₂Â in sea water is inversely proportional to
    oceanic temperature (i.e. more soluble in cooler temperatures)
-   It is therefore a concern that global warming could limit carbon
    storage in oceans, exacerbating climate change

Ocean-Atmosphere Exchange

-   Typically, when carbon dioxide is dissolved in the ocean, it
    combines with water molecules to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃)
-   The carbonic acid then dissociates to form bicarbonate ions
    (HCO₃^(â€“)) and hydrogen ions (H⁺)
-   The ocean also contains carbonate ions (CO₃^(â€“)), which are
    absorbed by coral and molluscs to form calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)
-   Calcium carbonate is used to form the hard exoskeletons of
    reef-building corals and is used by molluscs to develop shells
-   H⁺ ions can reduce the stock of carbonate ions in the ocean by
    combining with it to form bicarbonate
-   Hence, the levels of H⁺ ions must be kept low to ensure that their
    is sufficient stock of carbonate ions for aquatic organisms

Ocean Acidification

-   As a result of deforestation and the increased burning of fossil
    fuels, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased
-   With more CO₂ being absorbed by the oceans, there is an associated
    increase in the production of H⁺ ions
-   These H⁺ ions lower the pH of the ocean, causing acidification
    (ocean pH has dropped ~0.2 since the industrial revolution)
-   The H⁺ ions will also combine with carbonate ions, reducing
    theÂ amounts available to marine organisms
-   This will result in the formation of thinner, deformed shells and
    reduce the population numbers of reef-building corals
-   The reduction in pH will also dissolve calcium carbonate structures,
    enhancing the damage to shells and corals

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hair cells in the semicircular canals detect movement of the head

Â  Â Â 
The vestibular system is a sensory system in the inner ear that is
involved in balance and spatial orientation (proprioception)

-   Within the semicircular canals are gelatinous caps called cupula,
    which are embedded with numerous hair cells
-   When the head moves, the fluid in the semicircular canals
    (endolymph) follows the direction of movement (due to inertia)
-   This fluid movement exerts pressure on the hair cells embedded in
    the cupula, triggering nerve impulses
-   There are three semicircular canals at 90Âº angles to one another,
    allowing head movement to be detected in all three planes
-   The brain integrates information from the semicircular canals in
    each ear in order to identify head position and movement

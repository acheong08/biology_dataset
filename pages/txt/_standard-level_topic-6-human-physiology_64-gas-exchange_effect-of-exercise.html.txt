Effect of Exercise

While ventilation is driven by the need to expel carbon dioxide, the
uptake of oxygen is a vitally importantÂ corollary effect

-   Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration, by which large amounts
    of ATP areÂ produced (relative to anaerobic respiration)

When describing oxygen intake, the following terms are commonly used:

-   VO₂ â€“ The volume of oxygen absorbed by the body per minute and
    supplied to the tissues (i.e. oxygen consumption)
-   VO₂Â max â€“ The maximum rate at which oxygen can be absorbed and
    supplied to body tissues (i.e. maximum consumption)

At rest, the body does not consume the maximal amount of oxygen
available to the tissues (oxygen deficit)

-   As exercise intensity increases, the volume of oxygen supplied to
    the tissues also increases (up to the VO₂ max)
-   If energy demands exceedÂ oxygen intake, ATP may be produced via
    anaerobic respiration (producing lactic acid)
-   The lactic acid is transferred to the liver and requires oxygen to
    convert it back to a usable form (pyruvate)
-   This extra oxygen required to restore normal body functioning after
    exercise is referred to as the oxygen debt

The body requires more oxygen to generate a set amount of energy when
metabolising fats as compared to carbohydrates

-   This is why there is an increase in carbohydrate metabolism and a
    decrease in fat metabolism with higher intensity exercise

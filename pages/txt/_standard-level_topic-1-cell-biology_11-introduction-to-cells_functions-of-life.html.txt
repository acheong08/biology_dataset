Understanding:

â€¢ Â Organisms consisting of only one cell carry out all functions of
life in that cell

Â  Â Â 
Unicellular organisms (e.g. Euglena, amoeba) are the smallest organisms
capable of independent life

[mr sheng]

All living things carry out 7 basic functions integral to survival:

-   Metabolism â€“ Living things undertake essential chemical reactions
-   Reproduction â€“ Living things produce offspring, either sexually or
    asexually
-   Sensitivity â€“ LivingÂ things are responsive to internal and
    external stimuli
-   Homeostasis â€“ Living things maintain a stable internal environment
-   Excretion â€“ Living things exhibit the removal of waste products
-   Nutrition â€“ Living things exchange materials and gases with the
    environment
-   Growth â€“ Living things can move and change shape or size

Application:

â€¢ Â Investigate the functions of life in Paramecium and one named
photosynthetic unicellular organism

Â  Â Â 
As unicellular organisms are composed of a single cell, this cell must
be able to carry out all the life functions

How unicellular organisms fulfil these basic functions may differ
according to structure and habitat

1. Â Paramecium Â (heterotroph)

-   Paramecia are surrounded by small hairs called cilia which allow it
    to move (responsiveness)
-   Paramecia engulf food via a specialised membranous feeding groove
    called a cytostome (nutrition)
-   Food particles are enclosed within small vacuoles that contain
    enzymes for digestion (metabolism)
-   Solid wastes are removed via an anal pore, while liquid wastes are
    pumped out via contractile vacoules (excretion)
-   Essential gases enter (e.g. O₂) and exitÂ (e.g. CO₂)Â the cell via
    diffusion (homeostasis)
-   Paramecia divide asexually (fission) although horizontal gene
    transfer can occur via conjugation (reproduction)

2. Â Scenedesmus Â (autotroph)

-   Scenedesmus exchange gases and other essential materials via
    diffusion (nutrition / excretion)
-   Chlorophyll pigments allow organic molecules to be produced via
    photosynthesis (metabolism)
-   Daughter cells form as non-motile autospores via the internal
    asexual division of the parent cell (reproduction)
-   Scenedesmus may exist as unicells or form colonies for protection
    (responsiveness)

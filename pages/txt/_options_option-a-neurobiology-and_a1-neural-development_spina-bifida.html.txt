Application:

â€¢ Â Incomplete closure of the embryonic neural tube can cause spina
bifida

Â  Â Â 
Closure of the neural tube does not occur simultaneously along the
entire length of the embryo

-   The area where the brain forms is well advanced over the caudal
    (tail) region, where closure occurs more slowly

Spina bifida is a birth defect resulting in the incomplete closure of
the neural tube (and associated vertebrae)

-   It is most commonly seen in the lumbar and sacral areas, as these
    are the regions where closure is slowest
-   The vertebral processes do not fuse, leaving the spinal cord nerves
    exposed and prone to damage

Comparison of Vertebrae

[vertebrae]

The severity of the condition can vary from mild to severe depending on
the consequence of the incomplete closure

-   In cases of spina bifidaÂ occulta, the splits in the vertebrae are
    so small that the spinal cord does not protrude
-   In spina bifidaÂ cystica, a meningeal cyst forms (meningocele) which
    may include the spinal elements (myelomeningocele)
-   In the more severe cases, patients may typically suffer some degree
    of paralysis, as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction

Spina bifida is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and
environmental factors

-   The average worldwide incidence of the condition is ~1 in 1,000
    births, however marked geographic variation occurs
-   Not having enough folate in the diet during pregnancy is believed to
    play a significant role in causing spina bifida

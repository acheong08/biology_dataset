Types of Levers

Muscles and bones act together to achieve a variety of movement by
forming different types of levers

A lever consists of four main parts: lever arm, fulcrum, force and load

-   Bones function as the lever arm (structural framework of lever)
-   Joints function as the fulcrum (point on which the lever turns)
-   Muscles provide the force or effort required to move the lever
-   The load is typically the weight of the body part being moved

Levers can be categorised into different classes according to the
relative positions of the lever components

-   In first class levers, the fulcrum is between the load and the force
    (e.g. nodding the head)
-   In second class levers, the load is inbetween the fulcrum and the
    force (e.g. standing on tip toes)
-   In third class levers, the force is inbetween the fulcrum and the
    load (e.g. bending your arm)

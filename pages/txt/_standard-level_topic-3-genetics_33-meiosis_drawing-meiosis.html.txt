Drawing Meiosis

Meiosis consists of two divisions and results in the formation of four
daughter cells

-   Interphase replicates DNA in the S phase, so chromosomes should
    initially possess sister chromatidsÂ (Â |Â â†’Â XÂ )
-   The first division separates the homologous pairs ( X XÂ â†’Â X ,
    XÂ ) and hence halves the chromosome number
-   The second division separates the sister
    chromatidsÂ (Â XÂ â†’Â |Â ,Â |Â )Â leading to the formation of
    single chromatid chromosomes
-   By the end of the process, the cells should be haploid (have half
    the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell)

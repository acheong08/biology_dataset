Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hydrogen bonding and dipolarity explain the cohesive, adhesive,
thermal and solvent properties of water

Â  Â Â 
Water has the capacity to form intermolecular associations with
molecules that share common properties

Because water is polar it will be attracted to other molecules that are
polar or have an ionic charge

[cohesion versus adhesion]

Cohesive Properties:

-   Cohesion is the ability of like molecules to stick together
-   Water is strongly cohesive (it will form hydrogen bonds)

Adhesive Properties:

-   Adhesion is the ability of dissimilar molecules to stick together
-   Water will form intermolecular associations with polar and charged
    molecules

Significance of Cohesive and Adhesive Properties:

The cohesive properties of water explain its surface tensionÂ 

-   The hydrogen bonding between water molecules allows the liquid to
    resist low levels of external force (surface tension)
-   The high surface tension of water makes it sufficiently dense for
    certain smaller organisms to move along its surface

The adhesive properties of water explain its capillary action

-   Attraction to charged or polar surfaces (e.g. glass) allows water to
    flow in opposition of gravitational forces (capillary action)
-   This capillary action is necessary to allow water to be transported
    up plant stems via a transpiration stream

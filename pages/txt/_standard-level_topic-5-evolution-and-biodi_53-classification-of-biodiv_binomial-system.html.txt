Understanding:

â€¢ Â The binomial system of names for species is universal among
biologists and has been agreed and developedÂ 

Â  Â  at a series of congresses

Â  Â Â 
The binomial system of nomenclature is the formal system by which all
living species are classified (taxonomy)

-   It was initially developed by a Swedish botanist named Carolus
    Linnaeus in 1735Â 
-   It is periodically assessed and updated at a series of international
    congresses which occur every 4 years

The binomial system of nomenclature provides value because:

-   It allows for the identification and comparison of organisms based
    on recognised characteristics
-   It allows all organisms to be named according to a globally
    recognised scheme
-   It can show how closely related organisms are, allowing for the
    prediction of evolutionary links
-   It makes it easier to collect, sort and group information about
    organisms

Understanding:

â€¢ Â When species are discovered they are given scientific names using
the binomial system

Â  Â Â 
According to the binomial system of nomenclature, every organism is
designated a scientific name with two parts:

-   Genus is written first and is capitalised (e.g. Homo)
-   Species follows and is written in lower case (e.g. Homo sapiens)
-   Some species may occasionally have a sub-species designation (e.g.
    Homo sapiens sapiens â€“ modern man)

Writing conventions:

-   When typing the scientific name, it should be presented in italics
-   When hand writing the scientific name, it is customary to underline

Monocots versus Dicots

Flowering plants are the most diverse group of land plants and belong
within a phyla called angiospermophyta

-   Historically, angiosperms were subdivided into two identifiable
    groups â€“ monocotyledons and dicotyledons
-   However, recent molecular evidence has caused the dicotyledons to be
    reclassified as a paraphyletic groupÂ 
-   Due to the ease of identification, many scientists still prefer to
    categorise angiosperms as monocots or dicots

Monocotyledons and dicotyledons can be differentiated according to a
number of features:

-   Cotyledons â€“ monocots have one cotyledon within their seed, dicots
    have two cotyledons
-   Leaf veins â€“ monocots show parallel venation, whereas dicots
    display reticulated venation
-   Roots â€“ monocots have fibrous (adventitious) roots, dicots have a
    main tap root with lateral branches
-   Floral organs â€“ monocots have flower parts in multiples of three,
    dicots in multiples of four or five
-   Stem vascularisation â€“ the vascular bundles in monocots are
    scattered, whereas they form a ringed structure in dicots
-   Pollen â€“ monocot pollen has a single pore (monosulcate), dicot
    pollen has three pores or furrows (trisulcate)

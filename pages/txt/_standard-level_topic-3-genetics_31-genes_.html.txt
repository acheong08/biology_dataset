3.1 Â Genes

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Every living organism inheritsÂ 
a blueprint for life from its parents

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   A gene is a heritable factor that consists of a length of DNA and
    influences a specific characteristic
-   A gene occupies a specific position on a chromosome
-   The various specific forms of a gene are alleles
-   Alleles differ from each other by one or only a few bases
-   New alleles are formed by mutation
-   The genome is the whole of the genetic information of an organism
-   The entire base sequence of human genes was sequenced in the Human
    Genome Project

Applications:

-   The causes of sickle cell anaemia, including a base substitution
    mutation, a change to the base sequence of mRNA trancribed from it
    and a change to the sequence of a polypeptide inÂ haemoglobin
-   Comparison of the number of genes in humans with other species

Skills:

-   Use of a database to determine differences in the base sequence of a
    gene in two species

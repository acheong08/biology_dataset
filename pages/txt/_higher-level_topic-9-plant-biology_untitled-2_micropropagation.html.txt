Application:

â€¢ Â Micropropagation of plants using tissues from the shoot apex,
nutrient agar gels and growth hormones

Â  Â Â 
Micropropagation is a technique used to produce large numbers of
identical plants (clones) from a selected stock plant

-   Plants can reproduce asexually from meristems because they are
    undifferentiated cells capable of indeterminate growth
-   When a plant cutting is used to reproduce asexually in the native
    environment it is called vegetative propagation
-   When plant tissues are cultured in the laboratory (in vitro) in
    order to reproduce asexually it is called micropropagation

The process of micropropagation involves a number of key steps:

-   Specific plant tissue (typically the undifferentiated shoot apex) is
    selected from a stock plant and sterilised
-   The tissue sample (called the explant) is grown on a sterile
    nutrient agar gel
-   The explant is treated with growth hormones (e.g. auxins) to
    stimulate shoot and root development
-   The growing shoots can be continuously divided and separated to form
    new samples (multiplication phase)
-   Once the root and shoot are developed, the cloned plant can be
    transferred to soil

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of micropropagation for rapid bulking up of new varieties,
production of virus-free strains of existing

Â  Â Â varieties and propagation of orchids and other rare species

Â  Â Â 
Micropropagation is used to rapidly produce large numbers of cloned
plants under controlled conditions:
Rapid Bulking

-   Desirable stock plants can be cloned via micropropagation to
    conserve the fidelity of the selected characteristic
-   This process is more reliable that selective breeding because new
    plants are genetically identical to the stock plant
-   This technique is also used to rapidly produce large quantities of
    plants created via genetic modification

Virus-Free Strains

-   Plant viruses have the potential to decimate crops, crippling
    economies and leading to famine
-   Viruses typically spread through infected plants via the vascular
    tissue â€“ which meristems do not contain
-   Propagating plants from the non-infected meristems allows for the
    rapid reproduction of virus-free plant strains

Propagation of Rare Species

-   Micropropagation is commonly used to increase numbers ofÂ rare or
    endangered plant species
-   It is also used to increase numbers of species that are difficult to
    breed sexually (e.g. orchids)
-   It may also be used to increase numbers of plant species that are
    commercially in demandÂ

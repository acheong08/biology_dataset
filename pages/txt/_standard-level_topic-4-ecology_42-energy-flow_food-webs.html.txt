Food Webs

A food web is a diagram that shows how food chains are linked together
into more complex feeding relationships
A food web is more representative of actual feeding pathways within an
ecosystem because:

-   Organisms can have more than one food source
-   Organisms can have more than one predator

This means that, unlike a food chain, organisms in a food web can occupy
more than one trophic level

-   Hint: When constructing food webs, position organisms at their
    highest trophic level (keeps all arrows pointing in same direction)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evolution of homologous structures by adaptive radiation explains
similarities in structure when there areÂ 

Â  Â  differences in function

Â  Â Â 
Comparative anatomy of groups of organisms may show certain structural
features that are similar, implying common ancestry

-   Anatomical features that are similar in basic structure despite
    being used in different ways are called homologous structures
-   The more similar the homologous structures between two species are,
    the more closely related they are likely to be

Homologous structures illustrate adaptive radiation, whereby several new
species rapidly diversify from an ancestral source, with each new
species adapted to utilise a specific unoccupied nicheÂ

Application:

â€¢ Â Comparison of the pentadactyl limb of mammals, birds, amphibians &
reptiles with different modes of locomotion

Â  Â Â 
A classical example of homologous structures is the pentadactyl limb in
a variety of different animals

-   Mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles all share a similar
    arrangement of bones in their appendages based on a five-digit
    limbÂ 

Despite possessing similar bone arrangements, animal limbs may be highly
dissimilar according to the mode of locomotion:

-   Human hands are adapted for tool manipulation (power vs precision
    grip)
-   Bird and bat wings are adapted for flying
-   Horse hooves are adapted for galloping
-   Whale and dolphin fins are adapted for swimming

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gel electrophoresis is used to separate proteins or fragments of
DNA according to size

Â  Â Â 
Gel electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to separate and
isolate proteins or DNA fragments based on mass / size

-   Samples are placed in a block of gel and an electric current is
    appliedÂ which causes the samples to move through the gel
-   Smaller samples are less impeded by the gel matrix and hence will
    move faster through the gel
-   This causes samples of different sizes to separate as they travel at
    different speeds

While both DNA and proteins are separated according to the same basic
process, differences exist between the two protocols

DNA Separation

-   DNA may be cut into fragments using restrictionÂ endonuclease â€“
    different DNA samples will generate different fragment lengths
-   Fragments separate because DNA is negatively charged due to the
    presence of aÂ phosphate group (PO₄^(3â€“)) on each nucleotide
-   DNA samples are placed into an agarose gel and fragment size
    calculated by comparing against known industry standards
-   Specific sequences can be identified by incorporating a
    complementary radiolabelled hybridisation probe, transferring the
    separated sequences to a membrane and then visualising via
    autoradiography (Southern blotting)

Protein Separation

-   Proteins may be folded into a variety of shapes (affecting size) and
    have positive and negative regions (no clear charge)
-   Proteins must first be treated with an anionic detergent (SDS) in
    order to linearise and impart a uniform negative charge
-   Protein samples are placed into a polyacrylamide gel and sizes
    compared against known industry standards
-   Separated proteins are transferred to a membrane and then target
    proteins are identified by staining with specific monoclonal
    antibodies (Western blotting)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Infections by a pathogen can be detected by the presence of its
genetic material or by its antigens

Â  Â Â 
Surface Markers

Pathogenic infections by microorganisms can be detected by the presence
of specific markers on the cellâ€™s surface

-   These foreign markers which are capable of eliciting an immune
    response are called antigens
-   The part of the antigen to whichÂ specificÂ antibodies will bind is
    called an epitope (or antigenic determinant)

Specific infections can be identified by determining which antigens are
present to form a complex with specific antibodies

-   Infectious pathogens may possess multiple different antigens, with
    each antigen potentially possessing multiple epitopes
-   The presence of particular antigens can be detected by undertaking
    an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Predisposition to a genetic disease can be detected through the
presence of markers

Â  Â Â 
Genetic Markers

Certain genes may predispose individuals to particular disease
conditions (e.g. BRCA genes predispose to breast cancer)

-   Screening an individualâ€™s genome for certain genetic sequences
    allows for the identification of disease predispositions

Genetic markers can be detected using gene probes â€“ nucleotide
sequences that are complexed to fluorescent labels

-   The gene probe is complementary to specific target sequences and
    will hybridise and fluoresce if that sequence is present
-   A large variety of genetic markers can be tested for using DNA
    microarrays (also commonly known as DNA chips / biochips)

In addition to testing for genetic diseases, gene probes can also be
used to identify pathogenic genetic material

-   Pathogens will have unique genetic sequences which, if detected by a
    gene probe, will indicate infection has occurred
-   Pathogenic genetic material can be amplified and identified using
    modified PCR techniques

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Metabolites that indicate disease can be detected in blood and
urine

Â  Â Â 
Metabolic Markers

A disease is an abnormal condition of the body that impairs normal
functioning (i.e. deviation from homeostasis)

-   Diseased cells will have an altered metabolism and may synthesise
    products that are not present in normal, healthy cells
-   These metabolic products (metabolites) may be detected in blood or
    urine to enable identification of disease conditions
-   Disease metabolites may be detected with monoclonal antibodies using
    an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

10.1 Â Meiosis

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Meiosis leads to independent assortment of chromosomes Â 
and unique composition of alleles in daughter cells

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Chromosomes replicate in interphase before meiosis
-   Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I
-   Sister chromatids separate in meiosis II
-   Independent assortment of genes is due to the random orientation of
    pairs of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I
-   Chiasmata formation between non-sister chromatids can result in an
    exchange of alleles
-   Crossing over is the exchange of DNA material between non-sister
    homologous chromatids
-   Crossing over produces new combinations of alleles on the
    chromosomes of the haploid cells

Skills:

-   Drawing diagrams to show chiasmata formed by crossing over

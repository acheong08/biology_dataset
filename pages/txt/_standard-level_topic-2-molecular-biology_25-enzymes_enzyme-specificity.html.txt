Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzymes can be denatured

Â  Â Â 
All enzymes possess an indentation or cavity to which the substrate can
bind with high specificity â€“ this is the active site

-   The shape and chemical properties of the active site are highly
    dependent on the tertiary structure of the enzyme

Like all proteins, enzyme structure can be modified by external factors
such as high temperatures and extreme pH

-   These factors disrupt the chemical bonds which are necessary to
    maintain the tertiary structure of the enzyme
-   Any change to the structure of the active site (denaturation) will
    negatively affect the enzymeâ€™s capacity to bind the substrate

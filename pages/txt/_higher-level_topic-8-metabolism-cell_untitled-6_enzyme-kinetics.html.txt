Skill:

â€¢ Â Calculating and plotting rates of reaction from raw experimental
results

Â  Â Â 
The rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction can be calculated and plotted
according to the time taken for the reaction to proceed

-   The time taken can be measured according to either the amount of
    product formed or the amount of substrate consumed
-   Reaction rate is the inverse of time taken, meaning that the
    reaction rate is higher when less time is taken (and vice versa)

The rate of reaction can be calculated according to the following
formula:

-   Rate of reaction (s^(â€“1)) = 1 / time taken (s)

Factors which can influence the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction
include temperature, pH and substrate concentration

Skill:

â€¢ Â Distinguishing different types of inhibition from graphs at
specified substrate concentrations

Â  Â Â 
Competitive and non-competitive inhibitors effect the kinetics of an
enzyme-catalysed reaction in different ways:

-   Both reduce the rate of reaction by limiting the amount of
    uninhibited enzyme available for reaction

Competitive Inhibitors

-   Bind directly to the active site and hence exist in direct
    competition with the substrate
-   Increasing substrate levels will increase the likelihood of the
    enzyme colliding with the substrate instead of the inhibitor
-   The maximum rate of enzyme activity (Vmax) can still be achieved,
    although it requires a higher substrate concentration

Noncompetitive Inhibitors

-   Bind to an allosteric site and hence do not exist in direct
    competition with the substrate
-   Increasing substrate concentrations will not effect the level of
    inhibition caused by the non-competitive inhibitor
-   The maximum rate of enzyme activity (Vmax) is therefore reduced

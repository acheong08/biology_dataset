Chi Squared Table

A chi-squared table shows the distribution of critical values according
to each degree of freedom

-   This allows for an assessment to be made as to whether the data is
    statistically significant (p<0.05) or not

For accurate data, the following conditions should be met:

-   All items in the group should be independent and collected on a
    random basis
-   No group should contain very few items (e.g. less than 10)
-   The total number of items should be large (e.g. more than 50)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some fatty acids and some amino acids are essential

â€¢ Â Lack of essential amino acids affects the production of proteins

Â  Â Â 
Amino acids are the monomeric building blocks from which proteins are
constructed

-   There areÂ 20Â different amino acids which are universal to all
    living organisms

Amino acids can be either essential, non-essential or conditionally
non-essential according to dietary requirements

-   Essential amino acids cannot be produced by the body and must be
    present in the diet
-   Non-essential amino acids can be produced by the body and are
    therefore not required as part of the diet
-   Conditionally non-essential amino acids can be produced by the body,
    but at rates lower than certain conditional requirements (e.g.
    during pregnancy or infancy) â€“ they are essential at certain times
    only

A shortage of one or more essential amino acids in the diet will prevent
the production of specific proteins

-   This is known as protein deficiency malnutrition and the health
    effects will vary depending on the amino acid shortage

Application:

â€¢ Â Cause and treatment of phenylketonuria

Â  Â Â 
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic condition that results in the
impaired metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine

-   It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation to the
    gene encoding the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase
-   Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) normally converts excess
    phenylalanine within the body into tyrosine
-   In people with PKU, the excess phenylalanine is instead converted
    into phenylpyruvate (also known as phenylketone)
-   This results in a toxic build up of phenylketone in the blood and
    urine (hence phenylketonuria)

Untreated PKU can lead to brain damage and mental retardation, as well
as other serious medical problems

-   Infants with PKU are normal at birth because the mother is able to
    break down phenylalanine during pregnancy
-   Diagnosis of PKU is made by a simple blood test for elevated
    phenylalanine levels shortly after birth

PKU is treated by enforcing a strict diet that restricts the intake of
phenylalanine to prevent its build up within the body

-   This low-protein diet should include certain types of fruits,
    grains, vegetables and special formula milk
-   This diet should be supplemented with a medical formula that
    contains precise quantities of essential amino acids
-   Patients who are diagnosed early and maintain this strict diet can
    have a normal life span without damaging symptoms

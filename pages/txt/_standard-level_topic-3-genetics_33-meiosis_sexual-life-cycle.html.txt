Understanding:

â€¢ Â The halving of the chromosome number allows a sexual life cycle
with fusion of gametes

Â  Â Â 
Most sexually reproducing organisms are diploid, meaning they have two
copies of every chromosome (maternal / paternal copy)

-   In order to reproduce, these organisms need to make gametes that are
    haploid (one copy of each chromosome)

Fertilisation of two haploid gametes (egg + sperm) will result in the
formation of a diploid zygote that can grow via mitosis

-   If chromosome number was not halved in gametes, total chromosome
    numbers would double each generation (polyploidy)

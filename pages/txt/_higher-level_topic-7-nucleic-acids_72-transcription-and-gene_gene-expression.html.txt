Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gene expression is regulated by proteins that bind to specific
base sequences in DNA

Â  Â Â 
Transcriptional activity is regulated by two groups of proteins that
mediate binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter

Transcription factors form a complex with RNA polymerase at the promoter

-   RNA polymerase cannot initiate transcription without these factors
    and hence their levels regulate gene expression

Regulatory proteins bind to DNA sequences outside of the promoter and
interact with the transcription factors

-   Activator proteins bind to enhancer sites and increase the rate of
    transcription (by mediating complex formation)
-   Repressor proteins bind to silencer sequences and decrease the rate
    of transcription (by preventing complex formation)

The presence of certain transcription factors or regulatory proteins may
be tissue-specific

-   Additionally, chemical signals (e.g. hormones) can moderate protein
    levels and hence mediate a change in gene expression

Differential Gene Expression

Control Elements

The DNA sequences thatÂ regulatory proteins bind to are called control
elements

-   Some control elements are located close to the promoter (proximal
    elements) while others are more distant (distal elements)
-   Regulatory proteins typically bind to distal control elements,
    whereas transcription factors usually bind to proximal elements
-   Most genes have multiple control elements and hence gene expression
    is a tightly controlled and coordinated process

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The environment of a cell and of an organism has an impact on gene
expression

Â  Â Â 
Changes in the external or internal environment can result in changes to
gene expression patterns

-   Chemical signals within the cell can trigger changes in levels of
    regulatory proteins or transcription factors in response to stimuli
-   This allows gene expression to change in response to alterations in
    intracellular and extracellular conditions

There are a number of examples of organisms changing their gene
expression patterns in response to environmental changes:

-   Hydrangeas change colour depending on the pH of the soil (acidic
    soil = blue flower ; alkaline soil = pink flower)
-   The Himalayan rabbit produces a different fur pigment depending on
    the temperature (>35ÂºC = white fur ; <30ÂºC = black fur)
-   Humans produce different amounts of melanin (skin pigment) depending
    on light exposure
-   Certain species of fish, reptile and amphibian can even change
    gender in response to social cues (e.g. mate availability)

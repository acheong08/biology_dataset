Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Active transport uses energy to move molecules against a concentration
gradient

This energy may either be generated by:Â 

-   The direct hydrolysis of ATP (primary active transport)
-   Indirectly coupling transport with another molecule that is moving
    along its gradient (secondary active transport)

Active transport involves the use of carrier proteins (called protein
pumps due to their use of energy)

-   A specific solute will bind to the protein pump on one side of the
    membrane
-   The hydrolysis of ATP (to ADP + Pi) causes a conformational change
    in the protein pump
-   The solute molecule is consequently translocated across the membrane
    (against the gradient) and released

Application:

â€¢ Â Structure and function of sodium-potassium pumps for active
transport and potassium channels forÂ 

Â  Â facilitatedÂ diffusion in axons

Â  Â Â 
The axons of nerve cells transmit electrical impulses by translocating
ions to create a voltage difference across the membrane

-   At rest, the sodium-potassium pump expels sodium ions from the nerve
    cell, while potassium ions are accumulated within
-   When the neuron fires, these ions swap locations via facilitated
    diffusion via sodium andÂ potassium channels

Sodium-Potassium Pump

An integral protein that exchanges 3 sodium ions (moves out of cell)
with two potassium ions (moves into cell)

The process of ion exchange against the gradient is energy-dependent and
involves a number of key steps:

1.  Three sodium ions bind to intracellular sites on the
    sodium-potassium pump
2.  A phosphate group is transferred to the pump via the hydrolysis of
    ATP
3.  The pump undergoes a conformational change, translocating sodium
    across the membrane
4.  The conformational change exposes two potassium binding sites on the
    extracellular surface of the pump
5.  The phosphate group is released which causes the pump to return to
    its original conformation
6.  This translocates the potassium across the membrane, completing the
    ion exchange

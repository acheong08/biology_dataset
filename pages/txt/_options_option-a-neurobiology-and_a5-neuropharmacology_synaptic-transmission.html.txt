Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some neurotransmitters excite nerve impulses in postsynaptic
neurons and others inhibit them

Â  Â Â 
Presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that diffuse into the
synapse and bind receptors on postsynaptic neurons

-   Some neurotransmitters generate excitatory post-synaptic potentials
    (EPSPs) by causing depolarisation (e.g. glutamate)
-   Some neurotransmitters generate inhibitoryÂ post-synaptic potentials
    (IPSPs) by causing hyperpolarisation (e.g. GABA)

If the combination of excitatory and inhibitory signals reaches a
threshold limit, an action potential will be generated

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nerve impulses are initiated or inhibited in postsynaptic neurons
as a result of summation of all excitatory

Â  Â Â and inhibitory neurotransmitters received from presynaptic
neurons

Â  Â Â 

The combination of graded potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) in the
post-synaptic neuron is known as summation

-   Cancellation occurs when excitatory and inhibitory graded potentials
    cancel each other out (no threshold potential reached)
-   Spatial summation occurs when EPSPs are generated from multiple
    presynaptic neurons simultaneously to reach threshold
-   Temporal summation occurs when multiple EPSPs are generated from a
    single presynaptic neuron in quick succession

These summative effects determine which nerve pathways are activated and
hence lead to alternate decision-making processes

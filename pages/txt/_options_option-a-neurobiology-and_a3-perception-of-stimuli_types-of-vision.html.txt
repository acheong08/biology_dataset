Types of Vision

Accommodation is the process by which the human eye changes optical
power to maintain a clear focus on an object

-   This is mediated by ciliary muscles, which contract to change the
    aperture of the lens (and thus adjust focal distance)

Normally, the light from an object will be focused on the centre of the
retina (at the fovea) in a healthy person

-   However some individuals may be short / near-sighted (myopic) or
    long / far-sighted (hyperopic)

Short Sightedness

-   Light is focused in front of the retina, causing distant objects to
    appear blurry (close objects still appear focused)
-   Commonly develops with age (the ciliary muscles start to lose
    tensile strength, resulting in the widening of the lens)
-   Most common corrective measure is the use of concave lenses to
    refocus the incoming light

Long Sightedness

-   Light is focused on a point behind the retina, causing nearby
    objects to appear blurry (distant objects still appear focused)
-   It is a type of refractive error caused by imperfections in the eye
    (e.g. the eyeball may be too short)
-   Most common corrective measure is the use of convex lenses to
    refocus the incoming light

2.6 Â Structure of DNA and RNA

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The structure of DNA allows
efficient storage of genetic information

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides
-   DNA differs from RNA in the number of strands present, the base
    composition and the type of pentose
-   DNA is a double helix molecule made of two antiparallel strands of
    nucleotides linked by hydrogen bonding between complementary base
    pairs

Applications:

-   Crick and Watsonâ€™s elucidation of the structure of DNA using model
    making

Skills:

-   Drawing simple diagrams of the structure of single nucleotides of
    DNA and RNA, using circles, pentagons and rectangles to represent
    phosphates, pentoses and bases

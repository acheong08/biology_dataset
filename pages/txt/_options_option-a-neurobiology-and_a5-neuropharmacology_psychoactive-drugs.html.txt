Understanding:

â€¢ Â Psychoactive drugs affect the brain by either increasing or
decreasing postsynaptic transmission

â€¢ Â Stimulant drugs mimic the stimulation provided by the sympathetic
nervous system

Â  Â Â 
Psychoactive drugs affect the brain and personality by either increasing
or decreasing postsynaptic transmissions

-   Drugs that increase neurotransmission levels are called stimulants
    and increase psychomotor arousal and alertness
-   Drugs that decrease neurotransmission levels are called depressants
    and slow down brain activities and relax muscles

Stimulant drugs mimic the stimulation provided by the sympathetic
nervous system (i.e. 'fight or flightâ€™ responses)

-   Examples of stimulants include caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines,
    ecstasy (MDMA) and nicotine

Depressants reduce stimulation of the central nervous system and may
induce sleep (sedatives)

-   Examples of sedatives include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol
    and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC = cannabis)

Application:

â€¢ Â Effects on the nervous system of two stimulants and two sedatives

Â  Â Â 
Stimulants

1. Â Nicotine

-   Nicotine stimulates the cholinergic pathways by mimicking the action
    of acetylcholine (bindsÂ Ach receptors)
-   Nicotine is not broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase,
    resulting in overstimulation of Ach receptors
-   Nicotine raises dopamine levels in the brain (leading to addiction)
    and activates parasympathetic pathways (calming effect)

2. Â MDMA (ecstasy)

-   MDMA binds to reuptake pumps on presynaptic neurons and blocks the
    recycling of dopamine and serotonin (5-HT)
-   MDMA also enters the presynaptic neurons via the reuptake pumps and
    triggers the secretion of neurotransmitter
-   This increases levels of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft,
    prompting feelings of euphoria and heightened sensation

Sedatives

1. Â Benzodiazepine

-   Benzodiazepines bind to GABA receptors on the post-synaptic neuron
    and increase the efficiency of GABA action
-   GABA triggers the opening of chloride channels to
    causeÂ hyperpolarisation â€“ benzodiazepines enhance this effect
-   Benzodiazepines promote sleep-inducing and muscle relaxing responses
    by the body

2. Â Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)

-   THC mimics the neurotransmitter anandamide by binding to cannabinoid
    receptors on presynaptic neurons
-   Anandamide (and THC) blocks the release of inhibitory
    neurotransmitters that prevent dopamine secretion
-   By preventing the inhibition of dopamine secretion, THC causes a
    sense of euphoria and emotional well-being

Mechanism of Drug Action

Skill:

â€¢ Â Evaluation of data showing the impact of MDMA on serotonin and
dopamine metabolism in the brain

Â  Â Â 
MDMA (ecstasy) is a recreational drug known to increase the activity of
specific neurotransmitters â€“ serotonin and dopamine

-   Serotonin (5-HT) is found in regions of the brain associated with
    sleep and emotion and is involved in regulating mood
-   Dopamine is involved in the brainâ€™s reward pathway and plays an
    important role in regulating motivation and pleasure

MDMA binds to reuptake pumps and increases the release of
neurotransmitter whilst slowing its rate of uptake

-   This causes an overstimulation of post-synaptic receptors until
    neurotransmitter reserves are depleted
-   Long-term usage of MDMA can cause adverse changes to brain
    architecure and result in cognitive impairment

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Molecular biology explains living processes in terms of the
chemical substances involved

Â  Â Â 
Molecular biology is a field of study that focuses on investigating
biological activity at a molecular level

-   This includes elucidating the structure and function of chemical
    substances and determining their interactions as parts of living
    processes

Biological processes are tightly regulated by enzymes, whose expression
is controlled by gene activation (DNA)

-   Changes in activity are typically determined by signalling molecules
    (either endogenous or exogenous in origin)

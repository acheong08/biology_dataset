Asthma

Asthma is a common, chronic inflammation of the airways to the lungs
(i.e. bronchi and bronchioles)

-   Inflammation leads to swelling and mucus production, resulting in
    reduced airflow andÂ bronchospasm
-   During an acute asthma attack, constriction of the bronchi smooth
    muscle may cause significant airflow obstruction
-   Common symptoms of an asthma attack include shortness of breath,
    chest tightness, wheezing and coughing
-   Severe cases of asthma may be life threatening if left untreated

Asthma may be caused by a number of variable and recurring environmental
triggers, including allergens, smoke, cold air, certain medications and
arthropods (e.g. dust mites)

Pneumothorax

A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of gas in the pleural space
that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall

-   The pleural cavity is a thin, fluid-filled space between the lung
    and chest wall
-   Surface tension of the pleural fluid causes the lung to adhere
    closely to the chest wall and thus inflate upon chest expansion
-   If this cavity becomes filled with air (pneumothorax) or blood
    (haemothorax), the lung will collapse until the pressure is relieved
-   The build up of fluid or gas will also compress other local organs
    (including the heart), resulting in life threatening complications

A pneumothorax is typically treated by inserting a syringe into the
pleural cavity and draining the excess liquid or gas

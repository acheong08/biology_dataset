Key Features:

-   Pili â€“ shown as single lines
-   Flagella â€“ shown as thicker and significantly longer lines than

-   Ribosomes â€“ labelled as 70S
-   Cell wall â€“ labelled as being composed of peptidoglycan; thicker
    than cell membrane
-   Shape â€“ appropriate for bacteria chosen (e.g. E. coli is a
    rod-shaped bacillus)
-   Size â€“ appropriate dimensions (e.g. length of cell twice the
    width)

Greenhouse Impacts

There are many proposed environmental consequences associated with an
enhanced greenhouse effect, including:

-   Disease spread â€“ More temperate climates will increase the
    prevalence and spread of pathogenic vectors (e.g. mosquitos)
-   Ice caps melting â€“ Higher temperatures are melting ice caps and
    reducing permafrosts, releasing detritus trapped in ice
-   Extreme weather conditions â€“ Climate change is linked to an
    increase in extreme weather (e.g. cyclones, tropical storms)

-   Extinction â€“ Changing climate will increase competition, leading
    to a loss of biodiversity and extinction eventsÂ 
-   Acidification of oceans â€“ Rising atmospheric CO₂ levels contribute
    to an increase in the acidification of oceans
-   Rising sea levels â€“ Global warming is associated with rising sea
    levels, leading to the displacement of communities
-   Temperature increases â€“ Greenhouse gas emissions are linked to an
    increase in average global temperatures
-   Habitat destruction â€“ Changing climate conditions will lead to the
    destruction of habitats and expansion of temperate species

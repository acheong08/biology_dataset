1.4 Â Membrane Transport

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Membranes control the composition of cells
by active andÂ passive transport

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
    diffusion, osmosis and active transport
-   The fluidity of membranes allows materials to be taken into cells by
    endocytosis or released by exocytosis
-   Vesicles move materials within cells

Applications:

-   Structure and function of sodium-potassium pumps for active
    transport and potassium channels for facilitated diffusion in axons
-   Tissues or organs to be used in medical procedures must be bathed in
    a solution with the same osmolarity as the cytoplasm to prevent
    osmosis

Skills:

-   Estimation of osmolarity in tissues by bathing samples in hypotonic
    and hypertonic solutions

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A gene pool consists of all the genes and their different alleles,
present in an interbreeding population

Â  Â Â 
Gene Pools

A gene pool represents the sum total of alleles for all genes present in
a sexually reproducing population

-   A large gene pool indicates high amounts of genetic diversity,
    increasing the chances of biological fitness and survival
-   A small gene pool indicates low amounts of genetic diversity,
    reducing biological fitness and increasing chances of extinction

Gene pools can be used to determine allele frequency â€“ the proportion
of a particular allele within a population

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evolution requires that allele frequencies change with time in
populations

Â  Â Â 
Evolution is the cumulative change in the heritable characteristics of a
population across successive generations

-   This requires that allele frequencies change within the gene pool of
    the population to reflect these evolving characteristics

Mechanisms of Change

Changes to allele frequency within a gene pool (evolution) can result
from five key processes:

-   Mutation: Â A random change in the genetic composition of an
    organism due to changes in the DNA base sequence
-   Gene flow: Â The movement of alleles into, or out of, a population
    as a result of immigration or emigration
-   Sexual reproduction: Â Sex can introduce new gene combinations and
    alter allele frequencies if mating isÂ assortative
-   Genetic drift: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as a
    result of a chance or random event
-   Natural selection: Â The change in the composition of a gene pool as
    a result of differentially selective environmental pressures

4.1 Â Species, Communities and Ecosystems

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The continued survival of living organisms includingÂ 
humans depends on sustainable communities

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Species are groups of organisms that can potentially interbreed to
    produce fertile offspring
-   Members of a species may be reproductively isolated inÂ separate
    populations
-   A community is formed by populations of different species living
    together and interacting with each other
-   A community forms an ecosystem by its interactions with the abiotic
    environment
-   Species have either an autotrophic or heterotrophic method of
    nutrition (a few species have both methods)
-   Autotrophs obtain inorganic nutrients from the abiotic environment
-   Consumers are heterotrophs that feed on living organisms by
    ingestion
-   Detritivores are heterotrophs that obtain organic nutrients from
    detritus by internal digestion
-   Saprotrophs are heterotrophs that obtain organic nutrients from dead
    organisms by external digestion
-   The supply of inorganic nutrients is maintained by nutrient cycling
-   Ecosystems have the potential to be sustainable over long periods of
    time

Skills:

-   Classifying species as autotrophs, consumers, detritivores or
    saprotrophs from a knowledge of their mode of nutrition
-   Setting up sealed mesocosms to try to establish sustainability
-   Testing for association between two species using the chi-squared
    test with data obtained byÂ quadrat sampling
-   Recognising and interpreting statistical significance

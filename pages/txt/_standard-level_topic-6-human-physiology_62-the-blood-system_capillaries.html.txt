Understanding:

â€¢ Â Capillaries have permeable walls that allow exchange of material
between cells in tissues and blood in capillaries

Â  Â Â 
Structure and Function

The function of capillaries is to exchange materials between the cells
in tissues and blood travelling at low pressure (<10mmHg)

-   Arteries split into arterioles which in turn split into capillaries,
    decreasing arterial pressure as total vessel volume is increased
-   The branching of arteries into capillaries therefore ensures blood
    is moving slowly and all cells are located near a blood supply
-   After material exchange has occurred, capillaries will pool into
    venules which will in turn collate into larger veins

Capillaries have specialised structures in order to accomplish their
task of material exchange:

-   They have a very small diameter (~ 5 Âµm wide) which allows passage
    of only a single red blood cell at a time (optimal exchange)
-   The capillary wall is made of a single layer of cells to minimise
    the diffusion distance for permeable materials
-   They are surrounded by a basement membrane which is permeable to
    necessary materials
-   They may contain pores to further aid in the transport of materials
    between tissue fluid and blood

Capillaries structure may vary depending on its location in the body and
specific role:

-   The capillary wall may be continuous with endothelial cells held
    together by tight junctions to limit permeability of large molecules
-   In tissues specialised for absorption (e.g. intestines, kidneys),
    the capillary wall may be fenestrated (contains pores)
-   Some capillaries are sinusoidal and have open spaces between cells
    and be permeable to large molcules and cells (e.g. in liver)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Blood flows through tissues in capillaries

Â  Â Â 
Flow of Blood

Blood flows through the capillaries very slowly and at a very low
pressure in order to allow for maximal material exchange

-   The high blood pressure in arteries is dissapated by extensive
    branching of the vessels and the narrowing of the lumen

The higher hydrostatic pressure at the arteriole end of the capillary
forces material from the bloodstream into the tissue fluid

-   Material that exits the capillaries at body tissues include oxygen
    and nutrients (needed by the cells for respiration)

The lower hydrostatic pressure at the venule end of the capillary allows
materials from the tissues to enter the bloodstream

-   Materials that enters the capillaries at body tissues include carbon
    dioxide and urea (wastes produced by the cells)

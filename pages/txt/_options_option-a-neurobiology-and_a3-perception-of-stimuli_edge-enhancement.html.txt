Edge Enhancement

The human eye has the capacity to see the edges of objects in greater
contrast (edge enhancement)

-   This is why the eye can detect shapes and outlines in dark
    conditions, but not detect finer details

Stimulated photoreceptors will activate opposing bipolar cells but
inhibit adjacent bipolar cells

-   This is known as vertical activation and lateral inhibition
    respectively

This will increase the contrast between the light and dark borders of an
object due to the fact that:

-   The light edge is not being laterally inhibited by photoreceptors in
    the adjoining dark region (hence appears lighter)
-   The dark edge is not being vertically activated but is receiving
    lateral inhibition from the light edge (hence appears darker)

Optical Illusions

Edge enhancement can give rise to a number of different optical
illusions, including:

-   Scintillating Grid Illusion â€“ Dots appear to change colour as the
    point of visual focus is adjusted
-   Hermannâ€™s Grid Illusion â€“ Grey spots appear to be visible at the
    intersection between the white lines
-   Simultaneous Contrast â€“ A inner grey square appears darker when
    encased in a white square as opposed to a black square

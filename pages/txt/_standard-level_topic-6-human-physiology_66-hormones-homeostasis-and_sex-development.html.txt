Understanding:

â€¢ Â A gene on the Y chromosome causes embryonic gonads to develop as
testes and secrete testosterone

Â  Â Â 
Humans have 46 chromosomes in all diploid somatic cells â€“ 22 pairs are
autosomes and the 23^(rd) pair are the sex chromosomes

-   Females possess two copies of the X chromosome (XX), while males
    possess one X and a shorter Y chromosome (XY)

The Y chromosome includes a gene called the SRY gene (Sex Determining
Region Y), which leads to male development

-   The SRY gene codes for a testis-determining factor (TDF) that causes
    embryonic gonads to form into testes (male gonads)
-   In the absence of the TDF protein (i.e. no Y chromosome), the
    embryonic gonads will develop into ovaries (female gonads)

The male and female gametes produce different hormones to promote
further development of sex characteristics:

-   The testes produce testosterone to promote the further development
    of male sex characteristicsÂ 
-   The ovaries will produce estrogen and progesterone to promote the
    development of female sex characteristics

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Testosterone causes pre-natal development of male genitalia and
both sperm production and development of

Â  Â Â male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty

Â  Â Â 
The main male reproductive hormone is testosterone, which is secreted by
the testes and serves a number of roles:

-   It is responsible for the pre-natal development of male genitalia
-   It is involved in sperm production following the onset of puberty
-   It aids in the development of secondary sex characteristics
    (including body hair, muscle mass, deepening of voice, etc.)
-   It helps to maintain the male sex drive (libido)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Estrogen and progesterone cause pre-natal development of female
reproductive organs and female secondary

Â  Â Â sexual characteristics during puberty

Â  Â Â 
The main female reproductive hormones (secreted by the ovaries) are
estrogen and progesterone, which serve several roles:

-   They promote the pre-natal development of the female reproductive
    organs
-   They are responsible for the development of secondary sex
    characteristics (including body hair and breast development)
-   They are involved in monthly preparation of egg release following
    puberty (via the menstrual cycle)

Initially, estrogen and progesterone are secreted by the motherâ€™s
ovaries and then the placenta â€“ until female reproductive organs
develop (this occurs in the absence of testosterone)

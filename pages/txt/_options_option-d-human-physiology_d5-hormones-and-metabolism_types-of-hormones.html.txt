Understanding:

â€¢ Â Steroid hormones bind to receptor proteins in cytoplasm of target
cells to form a receptor-hormone complex

â€¢ Â The receptor-hormone complex promotes the transcription of
specific genes

Â  Â Â 
Steroid Hormones

-   Steroid hormones are lipophilic (fat-loving) â€“ meaning they can
    freely diffuse across the plasma membrane of a cell
-   They bind to receptors in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of the
    target cell, to form an active receptor-hormone complex
-   This activated complex will move into the nucleus and bind directly
    to DNA, acting as a transcription factor for gene expression
-   Examples of steroid hormones include those produced by the gonads
    (i.e. estrogen, progesterone and testosterone)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Peptide hormones bind to receptors in the plasma membrane of the
target cell

â€¢ Â Binding to membrane receptors activates a cascade mediated by a
second messenger inside the cell

Â  Â Â 
Peptide Hormones

-   Peptide hormones are hydrophylic and lipophobic (fat-hating) â€“
    meaning they cannot freely cross the plasma membrane
-   They bind to receptors on the surface of the cell, which are
    typically coupled to internally anchored proteins (e.g. G proteins)
-   The receptor complex activates a series of intracellular molecules
    called second messengers, which initiate cell activity
-   This process is called signal transduction, because the external
    signal (hormone) is transduced via internal intermediaries
-   Examples of second messengers include cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium
    ions (Ca²⁺), nitric oxide (NO) and protein kinases
-   The use of second messengers enables the amplification of the
    initial signal (as more molecules are activated)
-   Peptide hormones include insulin, glucagon, leptin, ADH and oxytocin

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fertilization in animals can be internal or external

Â  Â Â 
External Fertilization

-   External fertilization involves the fusion of gametes (egg and
    sperm) outside of the body of a parent
-   It is most common in aquatic animals, where the water acts as a
    medium via which the gametes can travel
-   This method of fertilization is susceptible to environmental
    influences, such as predators and pH changes
-   Consequently, species that reproduce this way usually release large
    quantities of gametes to compensate for losses
-   The process of releasing gametes into the water is called spawning

InternalÂ Fertilisation

-   Internal fertilization involves the fusion of gametes (egg and
    sperm) inside of the body of a parent
-   This requires a method by which the gamete of one parent can be
    introduced inside the body of another (e.g. copulation)
-   Terrestrial animals typically use internalÂ fertilization so as to
    prevent exposure and desiccation of gametes or embryos
-   Internal fertilization offers more protection to the gametes and
    embryos, but at a potential survival cost to the parentÂ

â€¢ Â Crick and Watsonâ€™s elucidation of the structure of DNA using
model making

Â  Â Â 
The structural organisation of the DNA molecule was correctly proposed
in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick

-   These British scientists constructed models to quickly visualise and
    assess the viability of potential structures

Their efforts were guided by an understanding of molecular distances and
bond angles developed by Linus Pauling, and were based upon some key
experimental discoveries:

-   DNA is composed of nucleotides made up of a sugar, phosphate and
    base â€“ Phoebus Levene, 1919
-   DNA is composed of an equal number of purines (A + G) and
    pyrimidines (C + T) â€“ Erwin Chargaff, 1950
-   DNA is organised into a helical structure â€“ Rosalind Franklin,
    1953Â  (data shared without permission)

Making DNA Models

Using trial and error, Watson and Crick were able to assemble a DNA
model that demonstrated the following:

-   DNA strands are antiparallel and form a double helix
-   DNA strands pair via complementary base pairing (A = T ; CÂ Îž G)
-   Outer edges of bases remain exposed (allows access to replicative
    and transcriptional proteins)

As Watson and Crickâ€™s model building was based on trial and error, a
number of early models possessed faults:

-   The first model generated was a triple helix
-   Early models had bases on the outside and sugar-phosphate residues
    in the centre
-   Nitrogenous bases were not initially configured correctly and hence
    did not demonstrate complementarity

The Rosalind Franklin Controversy

The final construction of a correct DNA molecule owed heavily to the
X-ray crystallography data generated by Franklin

-   This data confirmed the arrangement of the DNA strands into a
    helical structure
-   The data was shared without Franklinâ€™s knowledge or permission and
    contributed profoundly to the final design
-   Hence, Franklin is now recognised as a key contributor to the
    elucidation of DNA structure

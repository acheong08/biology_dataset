3.5 Â Genetic Modification and Biotechnology

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Scientists have developed techniques for
artificial manipulation of DNA, cells and organisms

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   PCR can be used to amplify small amounts of DNA
-   Gel electrophoresis is used to separate proteins or fragments of DNA
    according to size
-   DNA profiling involves comparison of DNA
-   Genetic modification is carried out by gene transfer between species
-   Clones are groups of genetically identical organisms, derived from a
    single original parent cell
-   Many plant species and some animal species have natural methods of
    cloning
-   Animals can be cloned at the embryo stage by breaking up the embryo
    into more than one group of cells
-   Methods have been developed for cloning adult animals using
    differentiated cells

Applications:

-   Use of DNA profiling in paternity and forensic investigations
-   Gene transfer to bacteria using plasmids makes use of restriction
    endonucleases and DNA ligase
-   Assessment of the potential risks and benefits associated with
    genetic modification of crops
-   Production of cloned embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear
    transfer

Skills:

-   Design of an experiment to assess one factor affecting the rooting
    of stem cuttings
-   Analysis of examples of DNA profiles
-   Analysis of data on risks to monarch butterflies of Bt crops

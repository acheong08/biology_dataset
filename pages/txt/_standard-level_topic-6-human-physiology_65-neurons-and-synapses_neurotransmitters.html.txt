Understanding:

â€¢ Â When presynaptic neurons areÂ depolarized they release a
neurotransmitter into the synapse

Â  Â Â 
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers released from neurons and
function to transmit signals across the synaptic cleft

-   Neurotransmitters are released in response to the depolarisation of
    the axon terminal of a presynapticÂ neuron
-   Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on post-synaptic cells and can
    either trigger (excitatory) or prevent (inhibitory) a response

Neurotransmitters can trigger a variety of responses depending on the
type of cell activated:

Application:

â€¢ Â Secretion and reabsorption of acetylcholine by neurons at synapses

Â  Â Â 
One example of a neurotransmitter used by both the central nervous
system and peripheral nervous system is acetylcholine

-   It is commonly released at neuromuscular junctions and binds to
    receptors on muscle fibres to trigger muscle contraction
-   It is also commonly released within the autonomic nervous system to
    promote parasympathetic responses (â€˜rest and digestâ€™)

Acetylcholine is created in the axon terminal by combining choline with
an acetyl group (derived from mitochondrial Acetyl CoA)

-   Acetylcholine is stored in vesicles within the axon terminal until
    released via exocytosis in response to a nerve impulse

Acetylcholine activates a post-synaptic cell by binding to one of two
classes of specific receptor (nicotinic or muscarinic)

-   Acetylcholine must be continually removed from the synapse, as
    overstimulation can lead to fatal convulsions and paralysis

Acetylcholine is broken down into its two component parts by the
synaptic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE)

-   AChE is either released into the synapse from the presynaptic neuron
    or embedded on the membrane of the post-synaptic cell
-   The liberated choline is returned to the presynaptic neuron where it
    is coupled with another acetate to reform acetylcholine

Application:

â€¢ Â Blocking of synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses in
insects by binding of neonicotinoid pesticides to

Â  Â Â acetylcholine receptors

Â  Â Â 
Neonicotinoid pesticides are able to irreversibly bind to nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors and trigger a sustained responseÂ 

-   Neonicotinoid pesticides cannot be broken down by
    acetylcholinesterase, resulting in permanent overstimulation of
    target cells

While low activation of acetylcholine receptors promotes nerve
signalling, overstimulation results in fatal convulsions and paralysis

-   Insects have a different composition of acetylcholine receptors
    which bind to neonicotinoids much more stronglyÂ 
-   Hence, neonicotinoids are significantly more toxic to insects than
    mammals, making them a highly effective pesticide

While neonicotinoids have been successfully used to protect crops from
pest species, there are disadvantages to their usageÂ 

-   Neonicotinoid use has been linked to a reduction in honey bee
    populations (bees are important pollinators within ecosystems)
-   Neonicotinoid use has also been linked to a reduction in bird
    populations (due to the loss of insects as a food source)
-   Consequently, certain countries (including the European Union) have
    restricted the use of neonicotinoid pesticides

Adaptive radiation describes the rapid evolutionary diversification of a
single ancestral line

-   It occurs when members of a single species occupy a variety of
    distinct niches with different environmental conditions
-   Consequently, members evolve different morphological features
    (adaptations) in response to the different selection pressures

An example of adaptive radiation can be seen in the variety of beak
types seen in the finches of the Galapagos Islands

-   These finches have specialised beak shapes depending on their
    primary source of nutrition (e.g. seeds, insects, nuts, nectar)

Daphne Major

Daphne Major is a volcanic island that forms part of the archipelago
that is collectively referred to as the Galapagos Islands

-   It is the native habitat of a variety of bird species known as
    Darwinâ€™s finches (subfamily: Geospizinae)

Darwinâ€™s finches demonstrate adaptive radiation and show marked
variation in beak size and shape according to diet

-   Finches that feed on seeds possess compact, powerful beaks â€“ with
    larger beaks better equipped to crack larger seed cases

In 1977, an extended drought changed the frequency of larger beak sizes
within the population by natural selection

-   Dry conditions result in plants producing larger seeds with tougher
    seed casings
-   Between 1976 and 1978 there was a change in average beak depth
    within the finch population
-   Finches with larger beaks were better equipped to feed on the seeds
    and thus produced more offspring with larger beaks

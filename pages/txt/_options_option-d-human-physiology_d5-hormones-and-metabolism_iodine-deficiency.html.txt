Iodine Deficiency

Certain hormones may require specifc precursor molecules in order to be
synthesised by the body

-   Thyroxin contains iodine within its chemical structure and cannot be
    produced if iodine is deficient in the diet
-   Iodine deficiency will therefore effect the thyroid gland â€“ where
    thyroxin is produced
-   IndividualsÂ with an iodine deficiency will develop an enlarged
    thyroid gland â€“ a condition known as goitre

Iodine deficiency is common in many countries, asÂ iodine is not a
common component of most diets (sea food excepted)

-   The International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency
    Disorders works to eliminate the harm of iodine deficiency
-   One strategy employed is to add iodine to common dietary products
    (e.g. iodised table salt)

Types of Fats

Whilst all types of fats consumed as part of dietary intake will cause
adverse health effects if taken in excessive amounts, some types of fats
are associated with increased health risks

The mix of fats in the diet influences the level of cholesterol in the
bloodstream

Saturated fats and trans fats raise blood cholesterol levels, while
(cis) unsaturated fats lower blood cholesterol levels

Comparison of Main Types of Fatty Acids

Regulating Blood Cholesterol Levels

Fats and cholesterol cannot dissolve in blood and are consequently
packaged with proteins (to form lipoproteins) for transport

-   Low density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to
    the rest of the body
-   High density lipoproteins (HDL) scavenge excess cholesterol and
    carry it back to the liver for disposal

Hence LDLs raise blood cholesterol levels (â€˜badâ€™) while HDLs lower
blood cholesterol levels (â€˜goodâ€™)
High intakes of certain types of fats will differentially affect
cholesterol levels in the blood

-   Saturated fats increase LDL levels within the body, raising blood
    cholesterol levels
-   Trans fats increase LDL levelsÂ and decrease HDLÂ levels within the
    body, significantly raising blood cholesterol levels
-   Unsaturated (cis) fats increase HDLÂ levels within the body,
    lowering blood cholesterol levels

Health Risks of High Cholesterol

High cholesterol levels in the bloodstream lead to the hardening and
narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis)

When there are high levels of LDL in the bloodstream, the LDL particles
will form deposits in the walls of the arteries

The accumulation of fat within the arterial walls lead to the
development of plaques which restrict blood flow

If coronary arteries become blocked, coronary heart disease (CHD) will
result â€“ this includes heart attacks and strokes Â

Application:

â€¢ Â Evaluation of evidence and the methods used to obtain the evidence
for health claims made about lipids

Â  Â Â 
Lipid Health Claims

There are two main health claims made about lipids in the diet:

-   Diets rich in saturated fats and trans fats increase the risk of CHD
-   Diets rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated (cis) fats
    decrease the risk of CHD

These health claims are made based on evidence collected in a number of
ways:

-   Epidemiological studies comparing different population groups
-   Intervention studies that monitor cohorts following dietary
    modifications
-   Experimental designs utilising animal models or data based on
    autopsies

Evidence Supporting Health Claims

A positive correlation has been found between the intake of saturated
fats and the incidence of CHD in human populations

-   Counter: Certain populations do not fit this trend (e.g. the Maasai
    tribe in Africa have a fat-rich diet but very low rates of CHD)

Intervention studies have shown that lowering dietary intakes of
saturated fats reduces factors associated with the development of CHD
(e.g. blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.)

-   Counter: Validity of intervention studies is dependent on size and
    composition of cohort, as well as the duration of the study

In patients who died from CHD, fatty deposits in diseased arteries were
found to contain high concentrations of trans fats

-   Counter: Genetic factors may play a role (e.g. blood cholesterol
    levels only show a weak association to dietary levels)

Evidence Against Health Claims

Proportion of saturated and trans fats in Western diets has decreased
over the last 50 years, but incidence of CHD has risen

-   Counter: Increased carbohydrate intake may cause detrimental health
    effects associated with CHD (e.g. diabetes, obesity)
-   Counter: Incidence of CHD dependent on a myriad of factors besides
    dietary intake (e.g. exercise, access to health care, etc.)Â

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In situ conservation may require active management of nature
reserves or national parks

Â  Â Â 
Conservation involves the protection andÂ maintenance of natural
resources â€“ such as trees, water and wildlife

-   Conservation can be either in situ (on site) or ex situ (off site)

In situ conservation is the preservation of plant and animal species
within their natural habitat

-   This typically involves the designation of protected areas of land
    as either nature reserves or national parks

These areas may require active management to ensure that an appropriate
and sustainable ecological balance is maintained

-   Ecological monitoring of species may be required to ensure viable
    population levels are maintained
-   Interventions may be required to prevent habitat degradation or
    competition from invasive species
-   Legislation may be necessary to ensure adequate funding for policing
    and education

In situ conservation offers several advantages when protecting
endangered species from extinction:

-   It allows species to live in the environment to which they are
    adapted and to occupy their natural position in the food chain
-   It maintains the animal's normal behaviour (offspring usually aquire
    skills from parents and peers around them)
-   Retaining the natural habitatÂ prevents its eventual loss and
    ensures it remains available for other endangered species
-   Such areas provide a place to return animals from breeding programs
    as they provide realistic conditions for reintegration
-   Reserves in different areas can share information and provide a
    place for scientific study and developing public awareness

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Ex situ conservation is the preservation of species outside their
natural habitats

Â  Â Â 
Ex situ conservation involves the preservation of plant and animal
species outside their natural habitats

-   Ex situ conservation may typically be required for critically
    endangered species when urgent intervention is required

There are several advantages associated with ex situ conservation:

-   It allows for greater control of essential conditions (e.g. climate
    control, dietary intake, veterinary care, etc.)
-   It can improve the chances of successful breeding by utilising
    artificial methods (e.g. embryo transfer, IVF, etc.)

Ex situ conservation is also associated with several disadvantages:

-   Such conservation methods do not prevent the potential destruction
    of their natural habitats
-   Species raised in captivity are less likely to be successfully
    reintroduced into the wild (loss of autonomous survival)
-   Ex situ conservation increases inbreeding by restricting the gene
    pool and restricts the evolution of the species

There are a number of ex situ conservation measures employed around the
world, including:

-   Captive breeding â€“ animals are raised and bred in containment
    (e.g. zoos) to ensure survival prospects
-   Botanical gardens â€“ areas devoted to the collection, cultivation
    and display of a wide variety of plant species
-   Seed banks â€“ secure sites that store and catalogue seeds, in order
    to preserve plant genetic diversity

Application:

â€¢ Â Case study of the captive breeding and reintroduction of an
endangered animal species

Â  Â Â 
Case Study 1: Â Indian Rhinoceros

-   The Indian rhinoceros is a endangered species with only
    approximately 3,500 rhinoceros living in the wild
-   This number was as low as 2,000 in the early 1990s, but has
    increased due toÂ successful captive breeding programs
-   In addition to habitat loss, the Indian rhinoceros is threatened by
    poachers (their horn is considered potent in some cultures)
-   It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list and the majority of
    the species is situated in Indian protected areas (reserves)Â

Case Study 2: Â Mountain Chicken Frog

-   The mountain chicken frog is a species of frog native to the
    Carribean islands of Dominica and Montserrat
-   The population of this frog has declined 81% in the last ten years
    due to the fungal disease chytridiomycosis
-   The mountain chicken frog is also threatened by human consumption
    (it is a local delicacy said to taste like chicken)
-   It is now considered to be critically endangered with fewer than
    8,000 individuals estimated to be existing in the wild
-   The frog has been artificially bred in laboratories in England prior
    to being reintroduced into the wild

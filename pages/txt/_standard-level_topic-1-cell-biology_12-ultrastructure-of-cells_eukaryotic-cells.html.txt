Understanding:

â€¢ Â Eukaryotes have a compartmentalised cell structure

Â  Â Â 
Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells contain a nucleus (â€˜euâ€™Â = good
/ true ;Â â€˜karyonâ€™Â = nucleus)

They have a more complex structure and are believed to have evolved from
prokaryotic cells (via endosymbiosis)

Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalised by membrane-bound structures
(organelles) that perform specific roles

Eukaryotes can be divided into four distinct kingdoms:

-   Protista â€“ unicellular organisms; or multicellular organisms
    without specialised tissue
-   Fungi â€“ have a cell wall made of chitin and obtain nutrition via
    heterotrophic absorption
-   Plantae â€“ have a cell wall made of cellulose and obtain nutrition
    autotrophically (via photosynthesis)
-   Animalia â€“ no cell wall and obtain nutrition via heterotrophic
    ingestion

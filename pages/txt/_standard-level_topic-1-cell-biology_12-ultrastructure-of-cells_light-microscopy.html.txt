Light Microscopy

Optical microscopes use lenses to bend light and magnify images (extent
of magnification determined by lenses)

-   Most light microscopes include both an ocular lens (~10Ã—) and
    objective lens (~10Ã—; 40Ã—; 100Ã—)

Components of a Light Microscope

[]
    Component:
       none
       Eyepiece
       Focus Mechanism
       Revolving Nosepiece
       Objective Lenses
       Stage
       Stage Clips
       Iris Diaphragm

Function of Microscope Components:

-   Eyepiece â€“ The point through which the magnified image is observed
    (contains ocular lens)
-   Focus Mechanism â€“ Responsible for resolving the image (may include
    both fine and coarse focus adjustments)
-   Revolving Nosepiece â€“ Rotating device that allows for selection of
    objective lens
-   Objective Lens â€“ Magnifies image of specimen (in conjunction with
    ocular lens)
-   Stage â€“ Platform on which specimen is positioned (specimen is
    usually affixed to a glassÂ slide)Â 
-   Stage Clips â€“ Holds specimen in place (some mechanical stages can
    be moved to reposition slide while viewing)
-   Iris Diaphragm â€“ Regulates the intensity of light that is
    projected onto the slide
-   Light Source â€“ Either external (redirected by mirrors) or internal
    (light bulb within the microscope base)Â

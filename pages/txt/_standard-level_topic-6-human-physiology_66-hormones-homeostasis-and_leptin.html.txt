Understanding:

â€¢ Â Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and act on the
hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite

Â  Â Â 
Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose cells that regulates fat stores
within the body by suppressing appetite

-   Leptin binds to receptors located within the hypothalamus to inhibit
    appetite and thereby reduce food intake

Overeating causes more adipose cells to formed and hence more leptin is
produced, suppressing further appetite

-   Conversely, periods of starvation lead to a reduction in adipose
    tissue and hence less leptin is released, triggering hunger

As obese people are constantly producing higher levels of leptin, their
body becomes progressively desensitised to the hormone

-   This means they are more likely to feel hungry, less likely to
    recognise when they are full and are hence more likely to overeat
-   Leptin resistance also develops with age, increasing the potential
    for weight gain later in life (e.g. theÂ â€˜middle-age spreadâ€™)

The Role of Leptin in Hunger and Satiety

Application:

â€¢ Â Testing of leptin on patients with clinical obesity and reasons
for the failure to control the disease

Â  Â Â 
Because leptin suppresses appetite, it was considered as a form of
treatment for individuals with clinical obesity

-   Theoretically, leptin injections would reduce hunger and limit food
    intake in obese individuals, leading to weight loss

Mice Experiments

Leptin trials were initially conducted by surgically fusing the blood
circulation of obese and healthy mice (parabiosis)

-   This experiment was conducted using mice that were either obese due
    to a leptin gene mutation or a defective leptin receptor

When the obese mouse with no leptin was parabiotically fused to a
healthy mouse:

-   Leptin in the blood of the healthy mouse was transferred to the
    obese mouse
-   The obese mouse responded to the leptin and began to lose weight,
    demonstrating the potential viability of leptin treatment

However, when the obese mouse with a defective leptin receptor was
parabiotically fused to a healthy mouse:

-   Leptin was transferred to the healthy mouse (the obese mouse
    overproduced leptin to compensate for low receptor sensitivity)Â 
-   The obese mouse remained obese as its body could not respond to
    leptin
-   The healthy mouse became emaciated due to the abnormally high levels
    of leptin transferred into its bloodstream

Human Experiments

Most humans have naturally high levels of leptin in the bloodstream

-   When linked to leptin activity, most cases of obesity are caused by
    an unresponsiveness to leptin and not a leptin deficiencyÂ 
-   Hence, in clinical trials, very few participants experienced
    significant weight loss in response to leptin injections
-   However, many patients did experience adverse side effects from
    leptin injections, including skin irritations
-   For these reasons, leptin treatments are not considered to be an
    effective way of controlling obesity

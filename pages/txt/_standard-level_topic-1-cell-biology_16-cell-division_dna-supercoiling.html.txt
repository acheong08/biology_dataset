Chromatin versus Chromosome

Chromatin:

-   DNA is usually loosely packed within the nucleus as unravelled
    chromatin
-   In this unravelled form, the DNA is accessible to transcriptional
    machinery and so genetic information can be translated
-   DNA is organised as chromatin in all non-dividing cells and
    throughout the process of interphase

Chromosome:

-   DNA is temporarily packaged into a tightly wound and condensed
    chromosome prior to division (viaÂ supercoiling)
-   In this condensed form, the DNA is able to be easily segregated
    however is inaccessible to transcriptional machinery
-   DNA is organised as chromosomes during the process of mitosis
    (condense in prophase, decondense in telophase)

Chromosome versus Chromatid

A chromosome is the condensed form of DNA which is visible during
mitosis (via microscopy)

As the DNA is replicated during the S phase of interphase, the
chromosome will initially contain two identical DNA strands

These genetically identical strands are called sister chromatids and are
held together by a central region called the centromere

When these chromatids separate during mitosis, they become independent
chromosomes, each made of a single DNA strand

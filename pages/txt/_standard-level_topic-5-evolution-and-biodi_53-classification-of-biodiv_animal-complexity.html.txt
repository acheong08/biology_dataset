Animal Complexity

Animal phyla can be differentiated according to a number of features of
increasing complexity

-   These features include body symmetry, number of body openings, body
    segmentation and the presence of a notochord

Body Symmetry

-   Body symmetry describes the alignment of body parts around a central
    axis (radial = circular plane ; bilateral = linear plane)
-   Porifera are the most primitive of animals and lack any body
    symmetry (asymmetrical) as they have no true tissues or organs
-   Cnidaria are sedentary or slow moving and have radial symmetry, so
    as to experience the environment equally from all directionsÂ 
-   All other animals have bilateral symmetry, which promotes
    development of a head and allows for streamlined, directional
    movement

Body Openings

-   Porifera are the most basic invertebrate and have no body openings
    â€“ instead they exchange materials through pores
-   Cnidaria and platyhelminths have a singular body opening, leading to
    a saccular digestive system
-   All other specified phyla have two body openings (i.e. a separate
    mouth and anus), resulting in a tubular digestive system
-   Having two body openings allows for specialisation of digestive
    processes as food is travelling in a single direction

Body Segmentation

-   Segmentation of body parts allows for the specialisation of function
    in these different areas
-   Organisms with more basic body plans (including porifera, cnidaria
    and platyhelminths) lack distinctive body segmentation
-   Organisms with more developed body plans have segmented bodies (e.g.
    annelids, mollusca, arthropoda, chordata)
-   Sometimes body segmentation may not be clearly visible â€“ all
    molluscs have a mantle, visceral mass and muscular foot but these
    segments may not be readily apparent through visual inspection

Chordates

-   All chordates share four key features: a notochord, a hollow dorsal
    nerve tube, pharyngeal slits and a postanal tail
-   These features are always present in an embryonic state, but might
    not always persist into adulthood
-   In vertebrates (a sub-phyla), the notochord is largely replaced and
    surrounded by vertebra, forming a backbone

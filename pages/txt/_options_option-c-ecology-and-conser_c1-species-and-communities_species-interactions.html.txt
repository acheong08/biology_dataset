Understanding:

â€¢ Â Interactions between species in a community can be classified
according to their effect

Â  Â Â 
In nature, no species exist in total isolation â€“ all organisms
interact with both the abiotic environment and other organisms

-   The interactions between species in a community can be classified
    according to their effect on the organisms involved

Herbivory

Herbivory is the act of eating only plant matter (e.g. primary consumers
are considered herbivores)

-   Herbivores may employ different feeding strategies (e.g. mucivores
    feed on plant sap, granivores feed on seeds, etc.)

Herbivory can be either harmful or beneficial to the plant species as a
whole:

-   Certain types of beetle may feed voraciously on the leaves / foliage
    of crop plants (folivores), causing crop failure
-   Fruit-eating animals (frugivores) spread the seeds from a fruit in
    their faeces, promoting overall seed dispersal Â 

Examples of Herbivores

Predation

Predation is a biological interaction whereby one organism (predator)
hunts and feeds on another organism (prey)

Because the predator relies on the prey as a food source, their
population levels are inextricably intertwined

-   If the prey population drops (e.g. due to over-feeding), predator
    numbers will dwindle as intra-specific competition increases
-   If the prey population rises, predator numbers will increase as a
    result of the over-abundance of a food source

Symbiosis

Symbiosis describes the close and persistent (long-term) interaction
between two species

-   Symbiotic relationships can be obligate (required for survival) or
    facultative (advantageous without being strictly necessary)

Symbiotic relationships can be beneficial to either one or both
organisms in the partnership:

-   MutualismÂ â€“ Both species benefit from the interaction (anemone
    protects clownfish, clownfish provides fecal matter for food)
-   CommensalismÂ â€“ One species benefits, the other is unaffected
    (barnacles transported to plankton-rich waters by whales)
-   ParasitismÂ â€“ One species benefits to the detriment of the other
    species (ticks or fleas feed on the blood of their canine host)

can interact within a community

Â  Â Â 
Mutualism

Mutualism describes an ongoing interaction between two species whereby
both species benefit from the interaction

-   Honey bees gather food (nectar) from flowers and distributes pollen
    between plants (mediating plant life cycle)
-   Plover birds pick food morsels from between the jaws of crocodiles,
    cleaning the crocodiles teeth in the process
-   Zooxanthellae (algae) photosynthesise within the protective
    environment of the polypâ€™s endodermis (feeding the coral)

[mutualism]

Commensalism

Commensalism describes an ongoing interaction between two species
whereby one benefits and the other is unaffected

-   Remora attach to the underside of larger predatory fish (e.g.
    sharks) and feed off the uneaten food scraps
-   Monarch butterflies can safely store poisonous chemicals produced by
    milkweeds, discouraging predators from eating it
-   Decorator crabs remove small fragments of tissue from sea sponges
    and uses them as a source of camouflage

[commensalism]

Parasitism

Parasitism describes an ongoing interaction between two species whereby
one species benefits at the other's expense

-   Ticks infest the skin and fur of host animals (such as humans),
    feeding off the host and potentially causing disease
-   Leeches attach to the skin and drinks the blood of the host animal
    until fully engorged
-   Tongue-eating louses eat the tongue of a fish (it may then function
    as a replacement tongue â€“ stealing ingested food)

Application:

â€¢ Â The symbiotic relationship between Zooxanthellae and reef-building
coral reef species

Â  Â Â 
Reef-building coral will form a symbiotic relationship with the
photosynthetic unicellular algae â€“ Zooxanthellae

-   Coral are colonial organisms made up of individual polyps that are
    connected by a layer of living tissue
-   The algae lives within the cells of the coralâ€™s endodermis
    (innermost lining of the animal)

The coral provides the algae with a protective environment and source of
inorganic compounds:

-   Coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate to build a stony skeleton
    which encases the polyps (and zooxanthellae)
-   Coral polyps also recycle the waste products of the algae and
    supplies the zooxanthellae with carbon dioxide

The zooxanthellae, in turn, provides the coral polyps with a necessary
source of nutrition:

-   The algae supplies the coral with oxygen, glucose and other organic
    molecules (produced via photosynthesis)
-   The algae also helps the coral to remove necessary waste products

Coral Bleaching

It is the zooxanthellae within the polyp endodermis which gives the
coral its vibrantÂ pigmentation

-   When there is a large scale loss of zooxanthellae from the coral
    (due to environmental stress), bleaching occurs
-   When bleaching occurs, coral begins to starve and will die unless
    the zooxanthellae are restored

Conditions which can cause coral bleaching include:

-   Changes in light availability (e.g. sedimentation may increase the
    opacity of the oceanic waters)
-   Temperature increases (water temperatures in excess of 30ÂºC can
    irrevocably stress the zooxanthellae)Â 
-   Ocean acidification (the build up of carbon dioxide concentrations
    in the ocean can lower pH and stress the algae)

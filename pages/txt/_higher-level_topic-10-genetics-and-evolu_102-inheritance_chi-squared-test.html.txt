Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chi-squared tests are used to determine whether the difference
between an observed and expected frequencyÂ 

Â  Â  distribution is statistically significant

Â  Â Â 
It is possible to infer whether two genes are linked or unlinked by
looking at the frequency distribution of potential phenotypes

Offspring with unlinked genes have an equal possibility of inheriting
any potential phenotypic combination

-   This is due to the random segregation of alleles via independent
    assortment

Offspring with linked genes will only express the phenotypic
combinations present in either parent unless crossing over occurs

-   Consequently, theÂ â€˜unlinkedâ€™Â recombinant phenotypes occur less
    frequently than theÂ â€˜linkedâ€™Â parental phenotypes

Chi-Squared Tests

Chi-squared tests are a statistical measure that are used to determine
whether the difference between an observed and expected frequency
distribution is statistically significant
If observed frequencies do not conform to those expected for an unlinked
dihybrid cross, this suggests that either:

-   Genes are linked and hence not independently assorted
-   The inheritance of the traits are not random, but are potentially
    being affected by natural selection

â€¢ Â Use of a chi-squared test on data from dihybrid crosses

Â  Â Â 
A chi-squared test can be applied to data generated from a dihybrid
cross to determine if there is a statistical correlation between
observed and expected frequencies

A chi-squared test can be completed by following five simple steps:

-   Identify hypotheses (null versus alternative)
-   Construct a table of frequencies (observed versus expected)
-   Apply the chi-squared formula
-   Determine the degree of freedom (df)
-   Identify the p value (should be <0.05)

Example of Chi-Squared Test Application

The trait for smooth peas (R) is dominant over wrinkled peas (r) and
yellow pea colour (Y) is dominant to green (y)

A dihybrid cross between two heterozygous pea plants is performed
(RrYyÂ Ã—Â RrYy)

The following phenotypic frequencies are observed:

-   701 smooth yellow peas Â ; Â 204 smooth green peas Â ; Â 243
    wrinkled yellow peas Â ; Â 68 wrinkled green peasÂ

Step 1: Â Identify hypotheses

A chi-squared test seeks to distinguish between two distinct
possibilities and hence requires two contrasting hypotheses:

-   Null hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference between
    observed and expected frequencies (i.e. genes are unlinked)
-   Alternative hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference
    between observed and expected frequencies (i.e. genes are linked)

Step 2: Â Construct a table of frequencies

A table must be constructed that compares observed and expected
frequencies for each possible phenotype

-   Expected frequencies are calculated by first determining the
    expected ratios and then multiplying against the observed total

Step 3: Â Apply the chi-squared formula

The formula used to calculate a statistical value for the chi-squared
test is as follows:

Where: Â âˆ‘Â = Sum Â ; Â O = Observed frequency Â ; Â E = Expected
frequency
These calculations can be broken down for each phenotype and added to
the table to make the final summation easier

[chi squared three]

Based on these results the statistical value calculated by the
chi-squared test is as follows:

-   ð??Œ²Â  = Â (0.42 + 2.53 + 0.99 + 0.84) Â = Â 4.76

Step 4: Â Determine the degree of freedom (df)

In order to determine if the chi-squared value is statistically
significant a degree of freedom must first be identified

-   The degree of freedom is a mathematical restriction that designates
    what range of values fall within each significance levelÂ 

The degree of freedom is calculated from the table of frequencies
according to the following formula:

df = (m â€“ 1) (n â€“ 1)Â 

Where: Â m = number of rows Â ; Â n = number of columns
For all dihybrid crosses, the degree of freedom should be: (number of
phenotypes â€“ 1)

-   In this particular instance, the degree of freedom is 3

Step 5: Â Identify the p value

The final step is to apply the value generated to a chi-squared
distribution table to determine if results are statistically significant

-   A value is considered significant if there is less than a 5%
    probability (p < 0.05) the results are attributable to chance

[chi squared four]

When df = 3, a value of greater than 7.815 is required for results to be
considered statistically significant (p < 0.05)

-   A value of 4.76 lies between p values of 0.25 and 0.1, meaning there
    is a 10 â€“ 25% probability results are caused by chance
-   Hence, the difference between observed and expected frequencies are
    not statistically significant

As results are not statistically significant, the alternative hypothesis
is rejected and the null hypothesis accepted:

-   Null hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference between
    observed and expected frequencies (genes are unlinked)

Practice Question

[question] In sweet pea plants, the trait for purple flowers (P) is
dominant to the trait for red flowers (p).
Similarly, the trait for long pollen (L) is dominant to the trait for
round pollen (l).
Two heterozygotes are crossed, yielding the following frequencies for
the F1 generation:
296 purple, long plants ; 19 purple, round plants ; 27 red, long plants
; 85 red, round plants
Activity: Use the chi-squared test to determine if these results are due
to independent assortment.

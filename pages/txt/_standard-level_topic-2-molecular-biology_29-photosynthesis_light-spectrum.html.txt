Understanding:

â€¢ Â Visible light has a range of wavelengths with violet the shortest
wavelength and red the longest

Â  Â Â 
The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of
electromagnetic radiation

The Sun emits its peak power in the visible region of this spectrum
(white light ~ 400 â€“ 700 nm)

Colours are different wavelengths of white light and range from red
(~700 nm) to violet (~400 nm)

The colours of the visible spectrum are (from longest to shortest
wavelength):

Red Â  Â Orange Â  Â Yellow Â  Â Green Â  Â Blue Â  Â Indigo Â 
Â VioletÂ  (Mnemonic: Â Roy G. Biv)

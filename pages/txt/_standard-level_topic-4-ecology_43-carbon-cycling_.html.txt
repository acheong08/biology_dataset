4.3 Â Carbon Cycling

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Continued availability of carbonÂ 
in ecosystems depends on carbon cycling

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Autotrophs convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and other
    carbon compounds
-   In aquatic ecosystems carbon is present as dissolved carbon dioxide
    and hydrogen carbonate ions
-   Carbon dioxide diffuses from the atmosphere or water into autotrophs
-   Carbon dioxide is produced by respiration and diffuses out of
    organisms into water or the atmosphere
-   Methane is produced from organic matter in anaerobic conditions by
    methanogenic archaeans and some diffuses into the atmosphere or
    accumulates in the ground
-   Methane is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere
-   Peat forms when organic matter is not fully decomposed because of
    acidic and/or anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils
-   Partially decomposed organic matter from past geological eras was
    converted into either coal or into oil and gas that accumulates in
    porous rocks
-   Carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of biomass and
    fossilised organic matter
-   Animals such as reef-building corals and mollusca haveÂ hard parts
    that are composed of calcium carbonate and can become fossilised in
    limestone

Applications:

-   Estimation of carbon fluxes due to processes in the carbon cycle
-   Analysis of data from air monitoring stations to explain annual
    fluctuations

Skills:

-   Construct a diagram of the carbon cycle

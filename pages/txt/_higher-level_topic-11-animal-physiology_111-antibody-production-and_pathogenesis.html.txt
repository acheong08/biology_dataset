Understanding:

â€¢ Â Pathogens can be species-specific although others can cross
species barriers

Â  Â Â 
A pathogen is an agent that causes disease â€“ either a microorganism
(bacteria, protist, fungi or parasite), virus or prion

-   A disease is any condition that disturbs the normal functioning of
    the body (i.e. the body can no longer maintain homeostasis)
-   An illness is a deterioration in the normal state of health of an
    organism (a disease may cause an illness)

Pathogens are generally species-specific in that their capacity to cause
disease (pathogenesis) is limited to a particular species

-   Polio, syphilis, measles andÂ gonorrhoea are examples of diseases
    caused by pathogens that specifically affect human hostsÂ 

Certain pathogens may cross the species barrier and be able to infect
and cause disease in a range of hosts

-   Diseases from animals that can be transmitted to humans are called
    zoonotic diseases (or zoonoses)
-   Examples of zoonotic diseases include rabies (dogs), certain strains
    of influenza (e.g. bird flu) and the bubonic plague (rats)

Disease Transmission

Transmission of infectious diseases can occur via a number of distinct
mechanisms:

-   Direct contact â€“ the transfer of pathogens via physical
    association or the exchange of body fluids
-   Contamination â€“ ingestion of pathogens growing on, or in, edible
    food sources
-   Airborne â€“ certain pathogens can be transferred in the air via
    coughing and sneezing
-   Vectors â€“ intermediary organisms that transfer pathogens without
    developing disease symptoms themselves

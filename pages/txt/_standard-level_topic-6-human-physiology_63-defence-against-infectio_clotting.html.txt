Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cuts in the skin are sealed by blood clotting

Â  Â Â 
Blood Clots

Clotting (haemostasis) is the mechanism by which broken blood vessels
are repaired when damaged

-   Clotting functions to prevent blood loss from the body and limit
    pathogenic access to the bloodstream when the skin is broken

There are two key components of a blood clot â€“ platelets and insoluble
fibrin strands

-   Platelets undergo a structural change when activated to form a
    sticky plug at the damaged region (primaryÂ haemostasis)
-   Fibrin strands form an insoluble mesh of fibres that trap blood
    cells at the site of damage (secondaryÂ haemostasis)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Clotting factors are released from platelets

â€¢ Â The cascade results in the rapid conversion of fibrinogen to
fibrin by thrombin

Â  Â Â 
Coagulation Cascade

The process by which blood clots are formed involves a complex set of
reactions collectively called the coagulation cascade

-   This cascade is stimulated by clotting factors released from damaged
    cells (extrinsic pathway) and platelets (intrinsic pathway)

The coagulation cascade involves many intermediary steps, however the
principal events are as follows:

-   Clotting factors cause platelets to become sticky and adhere to the
    damaged region to form a solid plug
-   These factors also initiate localised vasoconstriction to reduce
    blood flow through the damaged region
-   Additionally, clotting factors trigger the conversion of the
    inactive zymogen prothrombin into the activated enzyme thrombin
-   Thrombin in turn catalyses the conversion of the soluble plasma
    protein fibrinogen into an insolube fibrous form called fibrin
-   The fibrin strands form a mesh of fibres around the platelet plug
    and traps blood cells to form a temporary clot
-   When the damaged region is completely repaired, an enzyme (plasmin)
    is activated to dissolve the clot

â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of blood clot formation in coronary
arteries

Â  Â Â 
Coronary Thrombosis

Coronary thrombosis is the formation of a clot within the blood vessels
that supply and sustain the heart tissue (coronaryÂ arteries)

-   Occlusion of a coronary artery by a blood clot may lead to an acute
    myocardial infarction (heart attack)

Blood clots form in coronary arteries when the vessels are damaged as a
result of theÂ deposition ofÂ cholesterol (atherosclerosis)

-   AtheromasÂ (fatty deposits) develop in the arteries and
    significantly reduce the diameter of the lumen (stenosis)
-   The restricted blood flow increases pressure in the artery, leading
    to damage to the arterial wall (from shear stress)
-   The damaged region is repaired with fibrous tissue which
    significantly reduces the elasticity of the vessel wall
-   As the smooth lining of the artery is progressively degraded,
    lesions form calledÂ atherosclerotic plaques
-   If the plaque ruptures, blood clotting is triggered, forming
    aÂ thrombusÂ that restricts blood flow
-   If the thrombus is dislodged it becomes anÂ embolusÂ and can cause a
    blockage in a smaller arteriole

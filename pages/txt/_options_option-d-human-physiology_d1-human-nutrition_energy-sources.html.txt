Determining Energy Content

The energy content of food can be estimated by burning a sample of known
mass and measuring the energy released via calorimetry

-   Combustion of the food source causes the stored energy to be
    released as heat, which raises the temperature of water
-   The amount of energy required to raise 1 g of water by 1ÂºC is 4.18
    J â€“ this is the specific heat capacity of water

The equation for calculating the energy content of a food source via
calorimetry is as follows:

-   Energy (joules) = Mass of water (g)Â Ã— 4.2 (J/gÂºC)Â Ã— Temperature
    increase (ÂºC)

The biggest source of error in calorimetry is usually caused by the
unwanted loss of heat to the surrounding environment

-   The food sources should be burnt at a constant distance from the
    water to ensure reliability of results
-   The initial temperature and volume of water should also be kept
    constant (1 g of water = 1 cm³ or 1 ml)

Comparing Energy Content

The three types of nutrients that are commonly used as energy sources
areÂ carbohydrates, lipids (fats) and proteins

-   Carbohydrates are preferentially used as an energy source because
    they are easier to digest and transport
-   Lipids can store more energy per gram but are harder to digest and
    transport (hence are used for long-term storage)
-   Protein metabolism produces nitrogenous waste products which must be
    removed from cells

The relative energy content of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are as
follows:

-   Carbohydrates â€“ 1,760 kJ per 100 grams
-   Proteins â€“ 1,720 kJ per 100 grams
-   Fats â€“ 4,000 kJ per 100 grams

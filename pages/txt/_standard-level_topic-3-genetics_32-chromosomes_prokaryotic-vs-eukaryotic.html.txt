Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic DNA

Prokaryotic DNA:

-   Is found freely in the cytoplasm (within a region called the
    nucleoid)
-   Is naked (i.e. not bound with proteins and therefore doesnâ€™t form
    chromatin)
-   Genomes are compact (contain little repetitive DNA and no introns)
-   Contains extra-chromosomal plasmids
-   Is circular in shape

Eukaryotic DNA:

-   Is contained within a nucleus
-   Is bound to histone proteins
-   Genomes contain large amounts of non-coding and repetitive DNA
    (including introns)
-   Do not contain plasmids (but organelles such as the mitochondria may
    contain their own chromosomes)
-   Are linear in shape

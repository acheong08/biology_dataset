Sexual Dimorphism

Sexual dimorphism describes differences in the physical characteristics
of the two sexes (beyond sex organs)

-   These differences may be subtle or exaggerated, and include size,
    colours, markings and behaviours

Sexual dimorphism has evolved as a result of differential mate selection
in males and females of a species

-   Exaggerated traits (ornaments) are more likely to attract female
    attention, despite increasing exposure to predators
-   Over many generations, these traits have become more pronounced,
    leading to marked differences between sexes

Examples of sexual dimorphism can be seen in a number of animals:

-   Many species of birds show clear differences between males and
    females of the species (e.g. peacock and peahen)
-   Male and female deer can be differentiated by the presence of large
    antlers on the male stags
-   Even humans demonstrate clear sexual dimorphism (e.g. facial hair
    and other secondary sex characteristics)

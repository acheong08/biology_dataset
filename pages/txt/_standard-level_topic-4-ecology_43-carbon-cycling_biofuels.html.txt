Biofuels

Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source as they take several
million years to form through slow geological processes

-   Fossil fuels include coal (formed from peat) and oil and natural gas
    (e.g. petroleum)

Biofuels are liquid fuels that are produced from the structural
components (biomass) and waste of plant and animal matter

-   As they are derived from biological processes, they are functionally
    renewable (provided there is a constant stock of reagents)
-   Biofuels may use certain industrial wastes as reagents (e.g. COâ‚‚,
    heat), making them an ecologically sustainable alternative
-   Biofuels include bioethanol and biodiesel, with efforts ongoing to
    develop better purification and refinement techniques

â€¢ Â Drawing internal structure of seeds

Â  Â Â 
When fertilisation occurs, the ovule will develop into a seed (which may
be contained within a fruit)

-   The seed will be dispersed from the parental plant and will then
    germinate, giving rise to a new plant

A typical seed will possess the following features:

-   Testa â€“ an outer seed coat that protects the embryonic plant
-   Micropyle â€“ a small pore in the outer covering of the seed, that
    allows for the passage of water
-   Cotyledon â€“ contains the food stores for the seed and forms the
    embryonic leaves
-   Plumule â€“ the embryonic shoot (also called the epicotyl)
-   Radicle â€“ the embryonic root

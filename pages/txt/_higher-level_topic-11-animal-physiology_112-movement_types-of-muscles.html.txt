Types of Muscles

There are three main types of muscular tissue responsible for movement
within the human body:
Skeletal Muscle

-   Skeletal muscle is found attached to the skeleton and is responsible
    for the voluntary movement of bones
-   Skeletal muscle fibres run in parallel tracts and are multinucleated
    and heavily striated

Smooth Muscle

-   Smooth muscle is found in the lining of internal organs (GI tract,
    uterus, blood vessels, eyes, etc.)
-   It controls the involuntary constriction of these regions (e.g.
    peristalsis, vasoconstriction, pupil dilation)
-   Smooth muscle fibres are not striated, have a spindle shape and each
    fibre contains a single central nucleus

Cardiac Muscle

-   Cardiac muscle is found in the heart and is responsible for the
    rhythmic contraction of the heart (i.e. heart beat)
-   Cardiac muscle fibres are branching, intercalated, lightly striated
    Â and have a single nucleus per fibreÂ

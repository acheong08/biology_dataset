Insight Learning

Insight learning is the abrupt realisation of a problemâ€™s solution
through cognitive reasoning

-   It is not a result of trial and error, responding to a stimulus or
    mimicry through observation

Insight learning was first described by Wolfgang Kohler, who studied the
behaviour of a chimpanzee named Sultan

-   Sultan was placed in a cage and a piece of food was placed outside
    of his reach
-   Sultan was presented with a short stick, which he learned to use to
    drag the food close enough to reach
-   Kohler then moved the food outside of the range of the short stick
    but placed a longer stick within range
-   Sultan used the short stick to reach the longer stick, and then used
    the longer stick to reach the food
-   Sultan was never conditioned to use the short stick in this way â€“
    he had demonstrated insight learning

Insight learning is typically seen in organisms with higher cognitive
functions â€“ including primates, dolphins and crows

Biologically significant trace elements include:

Calcium (Ca) â€“ Important for neurotransmitter release from synapses

Iron (Fe) â€“ Found in haemoglobin and needed for oxygen transport

Sodium (Na) â€“ Involved in the generation of nerve impulses inÂ neurone

Phosphorus (P) â€“ Component of nucleic acids and cell membranes

Sulphur (S) â€“ Found in some amino acids, allows disulphide bonds to
form

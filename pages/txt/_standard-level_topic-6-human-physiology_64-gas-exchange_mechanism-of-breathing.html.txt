Understanding:

â€¢ Â Muscle contractions cause the pressure changes inside the thorax
that forces air in and out of the lungs

Â  Â Â 
Breathing is the active movement of respiratory muscles that enables the
passage of air into and out of the lungs

-   The contraction of respiratory muscles changes the volume of the
    thoracic cavity (i.e. the chest)

The mechanism of breathing occurs according to the principle of
Boyleâ€™s Law (pressure is inversely proportional to volume)

-   When the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, pressure in the
    thorax decreases
-   When the volume of the thoracic cavity decreases, pressure in the
    thorax increases

Gases will move from a region of high pressure to a region of lower
pressure (similar to movement via concentration gradient)

-   When the pressure in the chest is less than the atmospheric
    pressure, air will move into the lungs (inspiration)
-   When the pressure in the chest is greater than the atmospheric
    pressure, air will move out of the lungs (expiration)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Different muscles are required for inspiration and expiration
because muscles only do work when they contract

Â  Â Â 
Respiratory muscles contract to change the volume of the thoracic cavity
and hence alter the pressure in the chest

-   Because muscles only do work via contraction, different groups of
    muscles are required to expand and contract chest volume

Changing chest volume creates a pressure differential between the chest
and atmosphere â€“ with air then moving to equalise

-   Muscles that increase the volume of the chest cause inspiration (as
    chest pressure is less than atmospheric pressure)
-   Muscles the decrease the volume of the chest cause expiration (as
    chest pressure is greater than atmosphericÂ pressure)

Atmospheric pressure is lower at high altitudes, meaning a greater
increase in chest volume is required before a pressure differential is
formed â€“ making it harder to breathe at high altitudes

-   The body will adapt mechanisms to improve oxygen uptake under these
    conditions, which is why athletes will often undertake high altitude
    training prior to competitions

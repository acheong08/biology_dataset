Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Facilitated diffusion is the passive movement of molecules across the
cell membrane via the aid of a membrane protein

-   It is utilised by molecules that are unable to freely cross the
    phospholipid bilayer (e.g. large, polar molecules and ions)Â 
-   This process is mediated by two distinct types of transport proteins
    â€“ channel proteins and carrier proteins

Carrier Proteins

-   Integral glycoproteins which bind a solute and undergo a
    conformational change to translocate the solute across the membrane
-   Carrier proteins will only bind a specific molecule via an
    attachment similar to an enzyme-substrate interaction
-   Carrier proteins may move molecules against concentration gradients
    in the presence of ATP (i.e. are used in active transport)
-   Carrier proteins have a much slower rate of transport than channel
    proteins (by an order of ~1,000 molecules per second)

Channel Proteins

-   Integral lipoproteins which contain a pore via which ions may cross
    from one side of the membrane to the other
-   Channel proteins are ion-selective and may be gated to regulate the
    passage of ions in response to certain stimuli
-   Channel proteins only move molecules along a concentration gradient
    (i.e. are not used in active transport)
-   Channel proteins have a much faster rate of transport than carrier
    proteins

Application:

â€¢ Â Structure and function of sodium-potassium pumps for active
transport and potassium channels forÂ 

Â  Â facilitatedÂ diffusion in axons

Â  Â Â 
The axons of nerve cells transmit electrical impulses by translocating
ions to create a voltage difference across the membrane

-   At rest, the sodium-potassium pump expels sodium ions from the nerve
    cell, while potassium ions are accumulated within
-   When the neuron fires, these ions swap locations via facilitated
    diffusion via sodium and potassium channels

Potassium Channels

-   Integral proteins with a hydrophilic inner pore via which potassium
    ions may be transported
-   The channel is comprised of four transmembrane subunits, while the
    inner pore contains a selectivity filter at its narrowest region
    that restricts passage of alternative ions
-   Potassium channels are typically voltage-gated and cycle between an
    opened and closed conformation depending on the transmembrane
    voltage

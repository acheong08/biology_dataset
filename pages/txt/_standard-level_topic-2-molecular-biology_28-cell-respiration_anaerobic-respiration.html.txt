Understanding:

â€¢ Â Anaerobic cell respiration gives a small yield of ATP from glucose

Â  Â Â 
Both anaerobic and aerobic respiration pathways begin with the anaerobic
breakdown of glucoseÂ in the cytosolÂ by glycolysis
Glycolysis breaks down glucose (6-C) into two molecules of pyruvate
(3C), and also produces:

-   Hydrogen carriers (NADH) from an oxidised precursor (NAD⁺)
-   A small yield of ATP (net gain of 2 molecules)

Overview of Glycolysis

Anaerobic Respiration

Anaerobic respiration proceeds in the absence of oxygen and does not
result in the production of any further ATP molecules

-   In animals, the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid (or lactate)
-   In plants and yeasts, the pyruvate is converted into ethanol and
    carbon dioxideÂ 

The purpose of anaerobic respiration is to restore stocks of NAD⁺ â€“ as
this molecule is needed for glycolysis

-   By restoring stocks of NAD⁺ via anaerobic pathways, the organism can
    continue to produce ATP via glycolysis

The conversion of pyruvate into lactic acid (animals) or ethanol and CO₂
(plants / yeasts) is reversible

-   Hence, pyruvate levels can be restored once oxygen is present and a
    greater yield of ATP may be produced aerobically

Application:

â€¢ Â Lactate production in humans when anaerobic respiration is used to
maximise the power of muscle contractions

Â  Â Â 
Muscle contractions require the expenditure of high amounts of energy
and thus require high levels of ATP

When exercising at high intensity, the cellsâ€™Â energy demands will
exceed what the available levels of O₂ can supply aerobically

-   Hence the body will begin breaking down glucose anaerobically to
    maximise ATP production

This will result in an increase in the production of lactic acid, which
leads to muscle fatigue

-   When the individual stops exercising, oxygen levels will increase
    and lactate will be converted back to pyruvate

Although carbohydrates, lipids and proteins can all be consumed as
energy sources, only carbohydrates will typically undergo anaerobic
respiration

The Effect of Exercise Intensity on Carbohydrate Consumption (and
Lactate Production)

[lactic acid graph]

The above graph demonstrates how the conditions of cell respiration
change with increasing energy demand

-   At high intensities, the aerobic consumption of fats is decreased
    while the anaerobic consumption of sugars increases
-   Consequently, lactate levels will increase at higher levels of
    exercise intensity

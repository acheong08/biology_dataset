Precautionary Principle

The precautionary principle states that when a human-induced activity
raises a significant threat of harm to the environment or human health,
then precautionary measures should be taken even if there is no
scientific consensus regarding cause and effect
It is argued that the enhanced greenhouse effect requires precautionary
measures because:

-   The global climate is a complex phenomena with many emergent
    properties that are difficult to predict or control
-   Climatic changes are based on time frames well beyond human
    lifespans, making it difficult to gather scientific evidenceÂ 
-   If global warming continues to escalate unchecked, the consequences
    to mankind as a species are potentially life threateningÂ 

According to the precautionary principle, the onus for action falls on
those contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect

-   This makes action on climate change a global issue â€“ involving
    governments, industries, communities and the individual

The precautionary principle is effectively the reverse of theÂ â€˜burden
of proofâ€™, which advocates inaction until cause is proven

Precautionary Principle versus Burden of Proof

[precautionary principle]

Action on Climate Change

Arguments For:

-   Risks of inaction are potentially severe (e.g. more droughts,
    floods, rising sea levels)
-   Higher temperatures will increase the spread of vector-borne
    diseases
-   Loss of habitat will result in the extinction of some species (loss
    of biodiversity)
-   Climate changes may affect food production, resulting in famines
-   Climate changes could destroy certain industries which countries
    rely on (e.g. fishing), leading to poverty
-   These factors would increase economic burdens and competition for
    resources, creating international tensions

Arguments Against:

-   Cutting greenhouse emissions may delay economic growth in developing
    countries, increasing poverty
-   It is difficult to achieve globalÂ consensus on action and even
    harder to police
-   No guarantee that human intervention will be sufficient to alter
    global climate patterns
-   Restrictions imposed by carbon reduction schemes may prevent the
    development of beneficial future technologies
-   Carbon reduction schemes will likely result in significant job
    losses from key industries, requiring retraining of unemployed
    workers

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Community structure can be strongly affected by keystone species

Â  Â Â 
A keystone species is a species that has a disproportionately large
impact on the environment relative to its abundance

-   It is analogous to a keystone in an arch â€“ it fundamentally
    supports the whole structure and prevents it from collapsing

Keystone species may influence communities in a number of ways:

-   Predators â€“ they can exert pressure on lower trophic levels to
    prevent them from monopolising certain resources
-   Mutualism â€“ they can support the life cycle of a variety of
    species within a community (e.g. pollinators / seed dispersal)
-   Engineers â€“ they can refashion the environment in a manner that
    promotes the survival of other species

There are numerous examples of keystone species within different
communities:

-   Sea stars (predator) prey on urchins and mussels, preventing mussel
    overpopulation and coral reef destruction by urchins
-   Honey bees (mutualist) pollinate a wide variety of plant species,
    ensuring the continuation of the plant life cycleÂ 
-   Beavers (engineer) build dams that transform the environment in a
    manner that allows certain other species to survive

Keystone species are not the dominant species (most numerous) within a
community, nor do they have to be apex predators

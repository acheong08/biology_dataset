Understanding:

â€¢ Â Immobilised enzymes are widely used in industry

Â  Â Â 
Immobilised enzymes have been fixed to a static surface in order to
improve the efficiency of the catalysed reaction

-   Enzyme concentrations are conserved as the enzyme is not dissolved
    â€“ hence it can be retained for reuse
-   Separation of the product is more easily achieved as the enzyme
    remains attached to the static surface

Immobilised enzymes are utilised in a wide variety of industrial
practices:

-   Biofuels â€“ Enzymes are used to breakdown carbohydrates to produce
    ethanol-based fuels
-   MedicineÂ â€“ Enzymes are used to identify a range of conditions,
    including certain diseases and pregnancy
-   Biotechnology â€“ Enzymes are involved in a number of processes,
    including gene splicing
-   Food production â€“ Enzymes are used in the production and
    refinement of beers and dairy products
-   Textiles â€“ Enzymes are utilised in the processing of fibres (e.g.
    polishing cloth)
-   Paper â€“ Enzymes assist in the pulping of wood for paper production

â€¢ Â Methods of production of lactose-free milk and its advantages

Â  Â Â 
Lactose is a disaccharide of glucose and galactose which can be broken
down by the enzyme lactase

Historically, mammals exhibit a marked decrease in lactase production
after weaning, leading to lactose intolerance

-   Incidence of lactose intolerance is particularly high in Asian,
    African and Aboriginal populations
-   Incidence is lower in European populations (due to a mutation that
    maintains lactase production into adulthood)

Breakdown of Lactose by the Enzyme Lactase

Producing Lactose-Free Milk

Lactose-free milk can be produced by treating the milk with the enzyme
lactase

-   The lactase is purified from yeast or bacteria and then bound to an
    inert substance (such as alginate beads)
-   Milk is then repeatedly passed over this immobilised enzyme,
    becoming lactose-free

Scientists are currently attempting to create transgenic cows that
produce lactose-free milk

-   This involves splicing the lactase gene into the cowâ€™s genome so
    that the lactose is broken down prior to milking

Generation of Lactose-Free Milk Using Immobilised Enzymes

Advantages of Lactose-Free Dairy Products

The generation of lactose-free milk can be used in a variety of ways:

-   As a source of dairy for lactose-intolerant individuals
-   As a means of increasing sweetness in the absence of artificial
    sweeteners (monosaccharides are sweeter tasting)
-   As a way of reducing the crystallisation of ice-creams
    (monosaccharides are more soluble, less likely to crystalise)
-   As a means of reducing production time for cheeses and yogurts
    (bacteria ferment monosaccharides more readily)

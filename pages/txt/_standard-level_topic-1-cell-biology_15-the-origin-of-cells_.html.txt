1.5 Â The Origin of Cells

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
There is an unbroken chain of life from the first cells
on Earth to all cells in organisms alive today

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Cells can only be formed by division of pre-existing cells
-   The first cells must have arisen from non-living material
-   The origin of eukaryotic cells can be explained by the endosymbiotic
    theory

Applications:

-   Evidence from Pasteurâ€™s experiments that spontaneous generation of
    cells and organisms does not now occur on Earth

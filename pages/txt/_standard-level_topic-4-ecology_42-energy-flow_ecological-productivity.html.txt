Ecological Productivity

In ecology, production (or productivity) refers to the rate of
generation of biomass in an ecosystem

-   It is usually expressed in units of mass per area per time (e.g. kg
    m^(â€“2) day^(â€“1))

Primary Production

Primary production describes the production of chemical energy in
organic compounds by producers

-   The main source of energy for primary production is sunlight, but a
    fraction may be driven by chemosynthesis byÂ lithotrophs

Primary production may be categorised as one of two types:

-   Gross primary production (GPP) is the amount of chemical energy as
    biomass that a producer creates in a given length of time
-   Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of chemical energy that
    is not consumed by respiration (NPP = GPP â€“ respiration)

Secondary Production

Secondary production describes the generation of biomass by
heterotrophic organisms (consumers)

-   This biomass generation is driven by the transfer of organic
    compounds between trophic levels via feeding
-   Secondary production may also be categorised according to gross
    (total) and net (usable) amounts of biomass

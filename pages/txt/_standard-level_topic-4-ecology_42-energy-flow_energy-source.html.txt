Understanding:

â€¢ Â Most ecosystems rely on a supply of energy from sunlight

â€¢ Â Light energy is converted to chemical energy in carbon compounds
by photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 
All green plants, and some bacteria, are photoautotrophic â€“ they use
sunlight as a source of energy

-   This makes light the initial source of energy for almost all
    communities
-   In a few ecosystems the producers are chemoautotrophic bacteria,
    which use energy derived from chemical processes

Light energy is absorbed by photoautotrophs and is converted into
chemical energy via photosynthesis

-   This light energy is used to make organic compounds (e.g. sugars)
    from inorganic sources (e.g. CO₂)
-   Heterotrophs ingest these organic compounds in order to derive their
    chemical energy (ATP)
-   When organic compounds are broken down via cell respiration, ATP is
    produced to fuel metabolic processes

Chlorofluorocarbons

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are chemicals that have been widely used in
past as refrigerants, propellants and solvents

-   As CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, their
    manufacture and use is being phased out

The ozone layer is a stratospheric region composed of ozone (tri-atomic
oxygen â€“ O₃)Â 

-   CFCs are broken down by ultraviolet radiation to release chloride
    ions that react with ozone
-   The chloride ion breaks the ozone down into oxygen â€“ one chloride
    ion can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules

The Role of CFCs in Ozone Depletion

[CFCs]

Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs UV radiation, however there is a limit
to how much radiation ozone can absorb

-   Regions where the ozone layer is thinner (e.g. due to CFCs) will
    experience higher terrestrial UV levels
-   UV light penetrates tissues and damages DNA, causing gene mutations
    that can lead to cancer
-   It can also damage the ability of plants to carry out photosynthesis
    and kill phytoplankton, reducing productivity

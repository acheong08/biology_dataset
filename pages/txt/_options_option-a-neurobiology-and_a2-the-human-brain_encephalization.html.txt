â€¢ Â Analysis of correlations between body size and brain size in
different animals

Â  Â Â 
There is a positive correlation between body size and brain size in
different animals â€“ larger animals have larger brains

-   This correlation follows a linear pattern of progression but is not
    directly proportional

While an increase in body size results in an increase in brain size, the
brain:body ratio decreasesÂ in larger animals

-   Body mass increases disproportionately to an increase in brain mass
    as most tasks only require a fixed brain capacity
-   While there is a correlation between body size and brain size, there
    is not a correlation between brain size and intelligence

Encephalization is defined as the amount of brain mass relative to an
animal's body mass

-   Scientists have derived an encephalization quotient (EQ), which
    attempts to provide a rough estimate of potential cognition
-   The quotient is only applied to mammals â€“ higher values are
    indicativeÂ of a higher predicted capacity for intelligence

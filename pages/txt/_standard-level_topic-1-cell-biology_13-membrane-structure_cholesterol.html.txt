Understanding:

â€¢ Â Cholesterol is a component of animal cell membranes

Â  Â Â 
Cholesterol is a component of animal cell membranes, where it functions
to maintain integrity and mechanical stability

-   It is absent in plant cells, as these plasma membranes are
    surrounded and supported by a rigid cell wall made of cellulose

[cholesterol molecule]

Cholesterol is an amphipathic molecule (like phospholipids), meaning it
has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions

-   Cholesterolâ€™s hydroxyl (-OH) group is hydrophilic and aligns
    towards the phosphate heads of phospholipids
-   The remainder of the molecule (steroid ring and hydrocarbon tail) is
    hydrophobic and associates with the phospholipid tails

Application:

â€¢ Â Cholesterol in mammalian membranes reduces membrane fluidity and
permeability to some solutes

Â  Â Â 
Phospholipid bilayers are fluid, in that the phospholipids are in
constant movement relative to one another

Cholesterol interacts with the fatty acid tails of phospholipids to
moderate the properties of the membrane:

-   Cholesterol functions to immobilise the outer surface of the
    membrane, reducing fluidity
-   It makes the membrane less permeable to very small water-soluble
    molecules that would otherwise freely cross
-   It functions to separate phospholipid tails and so prevent
    crystallisation of the membrane
-   It helps secure peripheral proteins by forming high density lipid
    rafts capable of anchoring the protein

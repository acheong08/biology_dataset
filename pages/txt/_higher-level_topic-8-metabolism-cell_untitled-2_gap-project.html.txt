GAP Project

The Global Artificial Photosynthesis Project (GAP project) is an
international venture aimed at copying the natural process of
photosynthesis in order to develop more efficient solar energy
harvesting technologies

-   Artificial photosynthesis is intended to produce 'cleanâ€™Â energy,
    with heat the only product released

Artificial photosynthesis involves constructing systems that will
undertake three key steps:

-   Harvest light energy (e.g. using chromophores)Â 
-   Transduce this energy to electrons (a photosensitiser can then be
    used to transfer the electrons)
-   Use redox reactions to generate chemical fuel sources (e.g. hydrogen
    catalysts)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland to control circadian
rhythms

Â  Â Â 
Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland within the brain in
response to changes in light

-   Light exposure to the retina is relayed via the suprachiasmatic
    nucleus (in the hypothalamus) and inhibits melatonin secretion
-   Melatonin is therefore secreted in response to periods of darkness,
    resulting in higher concentrations at night

Circadian Rhythms

Melatonin secretion by the pineal gland of the brain plays a pivotal
role in the control of circadian rhythmsÂ 

-   Circadian rhythms are the bodyâ€™s physiological responses to the 24
    hour day-night cycle
-   Circadian rhythms are driven by an internal (endogenous) circadian
    clock, although they can be modulated by external factors

Melatonin is the hormone responsible for synchronising circadian rhythms
and regulates the body's sleep schedule

-   Melatonin secretion is suppressed by bright light (principally blue
    wavelengths) and hence levels increase during the night
-   Over a prolonged period, melatonin secretion becomes entrained to
    anticipate the onset of darkness and the approach of dayÂ 
-   Melatonin functions to promote activity in nocturnal animals and
    conversely promotes sleep in diurnal animals (like humans)
-   During sleep, necessary physiological changes occur in body
    temperature, brain wave activity and hormonal production
-   Melatonin levels naturally decrease with age, leading to changes in
    sleeping patterns in the elderly

Application:

â€¢ Â Causes of jet lag and use of melatonin to alleviate it

Â  Â Â 
Jet Lag

Jet lag is a physiological condition resulting from a change to the
bodyâ€™s normal circadian rhythm

-   This alteration is caused by the bodyâ€™s inability to rapidly
    adjust to a new time zone following extended air travel ('jet' lag)
-   The pineal gland continues to secrete melatonin according to the old
    time zone so that the sleep schedule is not synchronised to the new
    timezone

As a result of these sleep disturbances, individuals suffering from jet
lag will often experience symptoms associated with fatigue

-   Symptoms of jet lag include headaches, lethargy, increased
    irritability and reduced cognitive function
-   Jet lag should only last a few days and symptoms should resolve as
    the body resynchronises its circadian rhythm

Some health professionals recommend taking melatonin near the sleep time
of the new time zone to help recalibrate the body

-   By artificially increasing melatonin levels at the new night time,
    the body can respond quicker to the new day-night schedule

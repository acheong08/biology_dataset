Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA microarrays can be used to test for genetic predisposition or
to diagnose the disease

Â  Â Â 
Individuals can be screened for genetic diseases and cancers by using
cDNA and microarrays

-   This technology can also be used to investigate the protein
    expression pathways that lead to these conditions

cDNA

Complementary DNA (cDNA) is a molecule synthesised from an mRNA template
via reverse transcription

-   cDNA molecules represent gene sequences that areÂ actively
    transcribedÂ by a cell (as they were synthesised from mRNA)Â 
-   This makes them a valuable tool for determining expression patterns
    of proteins in normal and diseased states

Microarray

A DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA sequences (oligos)
attached to a solid surface

-   These sequences represent fractions of a large library of genes that
    are present in a cell
-   If a gene is active within a cell, then the cDNA (produced from the
    mRNA transcript) will bind to its complementary oligo
-   If the cDNA has been fluorescently labeled, then the complementary
    oligo can be identifiedÂ 
-   Each oligo represents a known gene sequence, so genetic diseases are
    identified according to whichÂ oligos are hybridised
-   The greater the expression of a particular gene, the brighter the
    fluorescence seen in the relevant microarray well

In addition to diagnosing genetic diseases, microarrays can also be used
to identify new genes that cause disease conditions

-   If cDNA from healthy and diseased cells are labeled with different
    fluorophores, comparisons of gene expression can be made
-   Genes that areÂ onlyÂ active in a diseased or normal state will be
    of particular interest to scientists

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of a simple microarray

Â  Â Â 
When microarrays are used to compare mRNA expression in healthy and
diseased cells, the following conventions are used:

-   cDNA from healthy cells are typically tagged with green
    fluorescence, while cDNA from diseased cells are tagged with red
-   This enables identification of genes present only in healthy cells
    (green), diseased cells (red), both (yellow) or neither (none)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream

Â  Â Â 
The endocrine system is comprised of ductless glands that release
chemicals into the blood to regulate body functions

-   AÂ hormoneÂ is a chemical messenger that is transported
    indiscriminately via the bloodstream to act on distant target cells
-   Hormones areÂ specificÂ and will only activate cells or tissues that
    possess the appropriate target receptor
-   The endocrine system is slower to initiate, but has a more prolonged
    response when compared to the nervous system

Endocrine Signalling

Endocrine Glands

Endocrine glands secrete their product (hormones) directly into the
bloodstream, rather than through a duct (e.g. exocrine gland)

-   Major endocrine glands include the pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid
    gland, pineal gland and the gonads (ovaries and testes)
-   The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine glands and
    function to link the nervous and endocrine systems
-   Some organs may also secrete hormones despite not being endocrine
    glands (e.g. adipose tissue secretes leptin)

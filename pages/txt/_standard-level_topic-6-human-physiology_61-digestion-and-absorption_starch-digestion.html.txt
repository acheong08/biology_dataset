Application:

â€¢ Â Processes occurring in the small intestine that result in the
digestion of starch and transport of the products of

Â  Â Â digestion to the liver

Â  Â Â 
Starch is a polysaccharide composed of glucose monomers and accounts for
~ 60% of the carbohydrates consumed by humans

-   Starch can exist in one of two forms â€“ linear chains (amylose) or
    branched chains (amylopectin)

The digestion of starch is initiated by salivary amylase in the mouth
and continued by pancreatic amylase in the intestines

-   Starch digestion by amylase does not occur in the stomach as the pH
    is unsuitable for amylase activity (optimal pH ~ 7)

Amylase digests amylose into maltose subunits (disaccharide) and digests
amylopectin into branched chains called dextrins

-   Both maltose and dextrin are digested by enzymes (maltase) which are
    fixed to the epithelial lining of the small intestine
-   The hydrolysis of maltose / dextrin results in the formation of
    glucose monomers

Glucose can be hydrolysed to produce ATP (cell respiration) or stored in
animals as the polysaccharide glycogen

-   Glucose monomers can also be generated from the breakdown of other
    disaccharides (such as lactose and sucrose)

Role of Pancreas

The pancreas serves two functions in the breakdown of starch:

-   It produces the enzyme amylase which is released from exocrine
    glands (acinar cells) into the intestinal tract
-   It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon which are released
    from endocrine glands (islets of Langerhans) into the blood

The hormones insulin and glucagon regulate the concentration of glucose
in the bloodstream (controls availability to cells)

-   Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by increasing glycogen synthesis
    and storage in the liver and adipose tissues
-   Glucagon increases blood glucose levels by limiting the synthesis
    and storage of glycogen by the liver and adipose tissues

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Macroplastic and microplastic debris has accumulated in marine
environments

Â  Â Â 
Plastics are a type of synthetic polymer found in certain types of
clothes, bottles, bags, food wrappings and containers

-   Most plastics are not biodegradable and persist in the environment
    for many centuries

Large visible plastic debris (> 1 mm) is defined asÂ macroplastic, while
smaller debris (< 1 mm) is defined asÂ microplastic

-   Macroplastic debris can be degraded and broken down into
    microplastic debris by UV radiation and the action of waves
-   Ocean currents will concentrate plastic debris in large oceanic
    convergence zones called gyres

Plastic debris will leach chemicals into the water and also absorb toxic
contaminants called persistent organic pollutants

-   Microplastics will absorb more persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
    due to their smaller size (more available surface area)

Both macroplastic and microplastic debris is ingested by marine animals,
which mistake the debris for food

-   This leads to the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of persistent
    organic pollutants within marine animals
-   It may also damage the stomach of animals or cause them to stop
    feeding (by taking up space in the digestive tract)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Case study of the impact of plastic debris on Laysan albatrosses
and one other named example

Â  Â Â 
Case Study One: Â Laysan Albatross

-   The Laysan albatross nests on islands found in the North Pacific
    gyre, where large amounts of plastic debris is found
-   The albatross feeds by skimming the ocean surface with their beak,
    causing them to ingest large quantities of plastic
-   Adults can regurgitate the plastics they have swallowed, but chicks
    are unable to â€“ as such it fills up their stomachs
-   Consequently the mortality rate in albatross chicks is very high
    (estimated 40% die before fledgling)

Case Study Two: Â Sea Turtles

-   Sea turtles will commonly mistake plastic bags for jellyfish (one of
    their primary food sources)
-   Ingestion of the plastic can be fatal â€“ the plastic can become
    lodged in the esophagus and cause future feeding problems
-   Plastic debris can also become wrapped around the turtle,
    restricting movement and developmental growth
-   It is estimated that plastic pollution harms ~100,000 sea turtles
    and other marine animals each year

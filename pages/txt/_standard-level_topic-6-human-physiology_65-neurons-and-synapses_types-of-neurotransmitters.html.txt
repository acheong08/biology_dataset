Types of Neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers released into the synaptic
cleft by neurons

-   They maintain signals in the nervous system by binding to receptors
    on post-synapticÂ neurons and triggering electrical impulses
-   They also activate responses by effector organs (such as contraction
    in muscles or hormone release from endocrine glands)

Neurotransmitters may be either excitatory or inhibitory in their effect
(some may be both depending on the receptor they bind to)

-   Excitatory neurotransmitters trigger depolarisation, increasing the
    likelihood of a response
-   Inhibitory neurotransmitters trigger hyperpolarisation, decreasing
    the likelihood of a response

Major Classes of Neurotransmitter

[types of neurotransmitters]

Examples of Neurotransmitters

Adrenaline

-   Adrenaline is primarily a hormone released by the adrenal gland, but
    some neurons may secrete it as a neurotransmitter
-   It increases heart rate and blood flow, leading to a physical boost
    and heightened awareness
-   It is produced during stressful or exciting situations

Noradrenaline

-   In contrast to adrenaline, noradrenaline is predominantly a
    neurotransmitter that is occasionally released as a hormone
-   It contracts blood vessels and increases blood flow, improving
    attention and the speed at which responsive actions occur

Dopamine

-   It is primarily responsible for feelings of pleasure, but is also
    involved in movement and motivation
-   People tend to repeat behaviours that lead to dopamine release,
    leading to addictions
-   Abnormal dopamine secretion is common in specific movement
    disorders, like Parkinsonâ€™s disease

Serotonin

-   Contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness
-   Is affected by exercise and light exposure, and plays a role in the
    sleep cycle and digestive system regulation

GABA

-   Inhibits neuron firing in the CNS â€“ high levels improve focus
    whereas low levels cause anxiety
-   Also contributes to motor control and vision

Acetylcholine

-   Involved in thought, learning and memory within the brain
-   Activates muscle contraction in the body and is also associated with
    attention and awakening

Glutamate

-   Most common brain neurotransmitter
-   Regulates development and creation of new nerve pathways and hence
    is involved in learning and memory

Endorphins

-   Release is associated with feelings of euphoria and a reduction in
    pain (bodyâ€™s natural 'pain killersâ€™)
-   Released during exercise, excitement and sex

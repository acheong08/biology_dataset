â€¢ Â Analysis of pedigree charts to deduce the patterns of inheritance
of genetic diseases

Â  Â Â 
A pedigree is a chart of the genetic history of a family over several
generations

-   Males are represented as squares, while females are represented as
    circles
-   Shaded symbols mean an individual is affected by a condition, while
    an unshaded symbol means they are unaffected
-   A horizontal line between man and woman represents mating and
    resulting children are shown as offshoots to this line
-   Generations are labeled with roman numerals and individuals are
    numbered according to age (oldest on the left)

Determining Autosomal Inheritance

Dominant and recessive disease conditions may be identified only if
certain patterns occur (otherwise it cannot be confirmed)

Autosomal Dominant

-   IfÂ both parents are affected and an offspring is unaffected, the
    traitÂ mustÂ be dominant (parents are both heterozygous)
-   All affected individuals must have at least one affected parent
-   If both parents are unaffected, all offspring must be unaffected
    (homozygous recessive)

Autosomal Recessive

-   IfÂ both parents are unaffected and an offspring is affected, the
    traitÂ mustÂ be recessive (parents are heterozygous carriers)
-   If both parents show a trait, all offspring must also exhibit the
    trait (homozygous recessive)

Determining X-Linked Inheritance

It is not possible to confirm sex linkage from pedigree charts, as
autosomal traits could potentially generate the same results

-   However certain trends can be used to confirm that a trait is not
    X-linked dominant or recessive

X-linked Dominant

-   If a male shows a trait, so too must all daughters as well as his
    mother
-   An unaffected mother cannot have affected sons (or an affected
    father)
-   X-linked dominant traits tend to be more common in females (this is
    not sufficient evidence though)

X-linked Recessive

-   If a female shows a trait, so too must all sons as well as her
    father
-   An unaffected mother can have affected sons if she is a carrier
    (heterozygous)
-   X-linked recessive traits tend to be moreÂ common in males (this is
    not sufficient evidence though)

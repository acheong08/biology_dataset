Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system is a secondary transport system that protects and
maintains the body by producing and filtering lymph

-   Lymph is a clear fluid that contains white blood cells and arises
    from the drainage of fluid from the blood and surrounding tissues
-   Lymph is filtered at points called lymph nodes, where pathogens are
    removed before the fluid is returned to venous circulation

In addition to its key immune function, the lymphatic system also
absorbs fats from the gut and extra fluids from all over the body

-   In this respect, the lymphatic system plays an important role in
    lipid transport and maintaining a viable blood pressure

Major lymphatic organs include the spleen, tonsils, thymus and adenoids

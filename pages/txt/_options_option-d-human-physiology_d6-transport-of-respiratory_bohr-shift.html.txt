Understanding:

â€¢ Â The Bohr shift explains the increased release of oxygen by
haemoglobin in respiring tissues

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ oxyhaemoglobinÂ dissociation curve demonstrates the saturation of
haemoglobin by oxygen under normal conditions

-   pH changes alter the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen and hence
    alters the uptake and release of O₂ by haemoglobin

Carbon dioxide lowers the pH of the blood (by forming carbonic acid),
which causes haemoglobin to release its oxygen

-   This is known as the Bohr effect â€“ a decrease in pH shifts the
    oxygen dissociation curve to the right

Cells with increased metabolism (i.e. respiring tissues) release greater
amounts of carbon dioxide (product of cell respiration)

-   Hence haemoglobin is promoted to release its oxygen at the regions
    of greatest need (oxygen is an input of cell respiration)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Anesthetics act by interfering with neural transmissions between
areas of sensory perception and the CNS

Â  Â Â 
Anesthetics act on ion channels to block the conduction of sensory nerve
signals to the central nervous system

-   This results in the loss of sensation (numbness) in the affected
    region, allowing for surgical interventions to occur

Anesthetics can be grouped into two classes â€“ local anesthetics and
general anesthetics

-   Local anesthetics only affect a localised region â€“ usually by
    blocking axonal sodium influx (conduction block)
-   General anesthetics affect the whole body â€“ this may involve
    blocking calcium influx to prevent neurotransmitter exocytosis

Application:

â€¢ Â The effect of anesthetics on awareness

Â  Â Â 
Different types of anesthetics will affect consciousness in different
ways:

-   General anesthetics will induce a temporary loss of consciousness as
    they interfere with neural transmissions in the brain
-   Local anesthesia will not result in a loss of consciousness and only
    cause a reversible loss of sensation to the affected area

General anesthetics are typically inhaled (to affect the whole body),
while local anaesthetics are injected into specific regions

-   General anesthetics are administered by trained specialists who
    monitor patient vitals for the duration of the procedure

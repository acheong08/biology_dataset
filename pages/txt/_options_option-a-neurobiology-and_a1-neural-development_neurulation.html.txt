Understanding:

â€¢ Â The neural tube of embryonic chordates is formed by infolding of
ectoderm followed by elongation of the tube

Â  Â Â 
The development of a fully-formed organism from a fertilised egg is
called embryogenesis

-   All tissues are derived from three initial germ layers (ectoderm,
    mesoderm, endoderm) formed via gastrulation
-   In chordates, a flexible notochord will develop during gastrulation
    and lead to the subsequent formation of a neural tube

The formation of a neural tube in embryonic chordates occurs via the
process of neurulation

-   Cells located in the outer germ layer (ectoderm) differentiate to
    form a neural plate
-   The neural plate then bends dorsally, folding inwards to form a
    groove flanked by a neural crest
-   The infolded groove closes off and separates from the neural crest
    to form the neural tube
-   The neural tube will elongate as the embryo develops and form the
    central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
-   The cells of the neural crest will differentiate to form the
    components of the peripheral nervous system

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram of embryonic tissues in Xenopus, used as
an animal model, during neurulation

Â  Â Â 
Xenopus are a genus of frog that possess robust embryos that can
tolerate extensive manipulation

-   This makes them a suitable animal models for investigating the
    developmental stages ofÂ embryogenesis

During neurulation, the following embryonic tissues should be easily
identifiable:

-   Three germ layers (outer = ectoderm ; middle = mesoderm ; inner =
    endoderm)
-   A hollow cavity called the archenteron (will develop into the
    digestive tract)
-   Notochord (flexible rod that stimulates neurulation)
-   Neural tube (developed from the infolding of the neural plate)

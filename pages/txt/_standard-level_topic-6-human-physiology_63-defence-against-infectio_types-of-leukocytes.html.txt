Types of Leukocytes

There are five distinct classes of leukocytes (white blood cells) that
coordinate to provide defence against infectious disease:
Neutrophils

-   Most abundant type of white blood cell and the first responder to
    microbial infection
-   They are unable to renew their lysosomes and die after having
    phagocytosed a few pathogens (forms the majority of pus)
-   Analogy: Â Standard police officer â€“ quick to respond to the
    situation, but lacks special training or skills and so dies rapidly

Eosinophils

-   Prominent at the sites of allergic reactions and parasitic
    infections (rare in blood but common at mucous membranes)
-   Do not phagocytose pathogens but instead release chemical products
    which perforate cell membranes
-   Consequently, they function as the primary response to large
    multicellular parasites (e.g. helminth infections)
-   Analogy: Â Fumigator â€“ specialised to deal with pests / parasites
    (e.g. helminths) by releasing chemical products

Basophil

-   Basophils are chiefly responsible for initiating inflammatory
    responses by releasing the chemicals histamine and heparin
-   Functionally they are similar to mast cells, however they circulate
    in the bloodstream whereas mast cells are localised
-   Because they promote inflammation, they are common contributors to
    allergic responses
-   Analogy: Â Fireman â€“ the leukocyte involved when a region
    isÂ inflamed (â€˜in flamesâ€™)

Monocyte

-   Monocytes are theÂ largest type of leukocyte and share phagocytosis
    duties with neutrophils
-   They are slower to respond than neutrophils but are longer lasting,
    as they can renew their lysosomes for continued digestion
-   Monocytes will differentiate into two types of cells in response to
    pathogenic infection â€“ macrophages and dendritic cells
-   Macrophages will remain in the tissue and phagocytose, whereas
    dendritic cells present antigen fragments to lymphocytes
-   Analogy: Â Riot police (macrophage) â€“ slower to respond than
    standard police but better prepared and survives for longer
-   Analogy: Â Signalman (dendritic cell) â€“ identifies the pathogen
    and sends signals to the appropriate special forces (lymphocytes)

Lymphocyte

-   Lymphocytes are responsible for the production of antibodies which
    target specific antigens present on pathogens
-   They are more common in the lymphatic system than blood and are
    slowest to respond (requiring antigen presentation)
-   Lymphocytes include B cells (which become antibody-secreting plasma
    cells) and T cells (which mediate B cell activity)
-   Lymphocytes are also involved in the destruction of virus-infected
    body cells (via cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells)
-   Analogy: Â Special forces / superheroes â€“ takes longest to
    mobilise but specially trained to target specific pathogens

Prevalence of Leukocytes

[angry monkey]

The relative proportions of the different types of white blood cells
are:

â€¢ Neutrophils (roughly 60 â€“ 70%)

â€¢Â Lymphocytes (roughly 20 â€“ 30%)

â€¢Â Monocytes (approximately 1 â€“ 6%)

â€¢Â Eosinophils (approximately 1 â€“ 3%)

â€¢Â Basophils (less than 1%)

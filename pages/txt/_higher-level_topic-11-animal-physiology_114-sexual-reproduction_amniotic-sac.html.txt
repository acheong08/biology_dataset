Amniotic Sac

The foetus develops in a fluid-filled space that is encased by an
amniotic sac

-   The amniotic sac separates the foetus from the mother and hence
    functions as a barrier against infection

The amniotic sac is filled with a protective liquid called amniotic
fluid, which serves a number of key roles:

-   The fluid is largely incompressible and good at absorbing pressure,
    and so protects the foetus from impacts to the uterus
-   The fluid also creates buoyancy so that the foetus does not have to
    support its own weight while a skeletal system develops
-   Finally, amniotic fluid prevents the dehydration of foetal tissues

The amniotic sac ruptures when a woman comes to term during labour â€“
this is known as herÂ â€˜waters breaking'

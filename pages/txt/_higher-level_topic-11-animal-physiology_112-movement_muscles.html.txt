Understanding:

â€¢ Â Movement of the body requires muscles to work in antagonistic
pairs

Â  Â Â 
Muscles connect to bones (via tendons) and contract to provide the force
required to produce movement

-   The muscle connects a static bone (point of origin) to a moving bone
    (point of insertion)

Skeletal muscles exist in antagonistic pairs (when one contracts, the
other relaxes) to enable opposing movementsÂ 

-   Opposing movements may include: flexion vs extension, abduction vs
    adduction, protraction vs retraction, etc.

Application:

â€¢ Â Antagonistic pairs of muscles in an insect leg

Â  Â Â 
Many types of insects (including grasshoppers and praying mantises) have
hind legs that are specialised for jumping

-   The jointed exoskeleton of the hind leg is divided into three parts:
    femur (upperÂ leg), tibia (middle leg) and tarsus (lower leg)
-   The femur and tibia are connected by two antagonistic muscles:
    flexor tibiae muscle and extensor tibiae muscle

When the flexor muscle contracts, the extensor muscle relaxes and the
tibia and femur are brought closer together

-   This retracts the hind quarters in preparation for pushing off the
    ground

When the extensor muscle contracts, theÂ flexor muscle relaxes and the
tibia is pushed away from the femur

-   This extends the hind quarters and causes the insect to jump

Application:

â€¢ Â Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of stomach ulcers

Â  Â Â 
Stomach ulcers are inflammed and damaged areas in the stomach wall,
typically caused by exposure to gastric acids

-   There is a strong positive correlation between Helicobacter pylori
    infection and the development of stomach ulcers

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that can survive the acid conditions
of the stomach by penetrating the mucus lining

-   H. pylori anchors to the epithelial lining of the stomach,
    underneath the mucus lining
-   An inflammatory immune response damages the epithelial cells of the
    stomach â€“ including the mucus-secreting goblet cells
-   This results in the degradation of the protective mucus lining,
    exposing the stomach wall to gastric acids and causing ulcers
-   The prolonged presence of stomach ulcers may lead to the development
    of stomach cancer over many years (20 â€“ 30 years)
-   Â H. pylori infectionsÂ can be treated by antibiotics (previously,
    stomach ulcers were considered stress related and not treatable)

Application:

â€¢ Â Dehydration due to cholera toxin

Â  Â Â 
Vibrio cholerae is a bacterial pathogen that infects the intestines and
causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration

-   The associated disease â€“ cholera â€“ can kill within hours unless
    treated with oral rehydration therapies

V.Â cholerae releases a toxin that binds to ganglioside receptors on the
surface of intestinal epithelium cells

-   This toxin is internalised by endocytosis and triggers the
    production of cyclic AMP (a second messenger) within the cell
-   Cyclic AMP (cAMP) activates specific ion channels within the cell
    membrane, causing an efflux of ions from the cell
-   The build up of ions in the intestinal lumen draws water from cells
    and tissues via osmosis â€“ causing acute diarrhoea
-   As water is being removed from body tissues, dehydration will result
    if left untreated

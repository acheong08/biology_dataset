Cell Death

The death of a cell may occur by one of two main mechanisms â€“ necrosis
or apoptosis

While necrosis is a traumatic cellular response that is detrimental,
apoptosis is an important and necessary cellular process

Necrosis is uncontrolled cell death (â€˜cell homicideâ€™)

-   Necrosis is the premature death of a cell, caused by disruption to
    the cell by injury, toxins or nutritional deprivation
-   The cell loses functional control and there is destabilisation of
    the plasma and organelle membranes
-   This leads to swelling of the cell and organelles due to increased
    osmotic pressure, and the cell eventually bursts
-   The uncontrolled release of cell contents causes inflammation,
    potentially damaging surrounding tissue

Apoptosis is programmed cell death (â€˜cell suicideâ€™)

-   Apoptosis is a controlled event regulated by molecular signals which
    inhibit or promote this process
-   Mitochondrial proteins play an important role in initiating
    apoptotic processes
-   Catabolic reactions are triggered which digest cytoplasmic
    components, including the cytoskeleton
-   The plasma membrane undergoes irregular bulging, or blebbing, and
    cell contents are repackaged for safe removal
-   The cell shrinks and fragments into apoptotic bodies which are
    subsequently engulfed by neighbouring cells

Apoptosis versus Necrosis

Apoptosis and necrosis can be distinguished according to a number of
differential features â€“ these include:

[sumo]

-   Size (cellular response and area of effect)
-   Uptake (destination of contents and localised effects)
-   Membrane (integrity of bilayer)
-   Organelles (preserved or destroyed)

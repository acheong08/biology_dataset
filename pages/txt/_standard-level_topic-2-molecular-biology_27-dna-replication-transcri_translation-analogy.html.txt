Translation Analogy

A cell is like a restaurant â€“ differentiated cell types are like
restaurants specialising in different cuisines

The DNA is the set of instructions for the cell â€“ like a cook book is
the set of instructions for a restaurant

A single DNA instruction is a gene â€“ this is akin to a single recipe
in a cook book

Transcription is the process of making an RNA copy of a gene â€“ RNA
polymerase is like a photocopy machine

The mRNA transcript (i.e. photocopied recipe) is transported to the
ribosome â€“ which functions as the cook

The ribosome reads the mRNA one codon at a time â€“ as a cook would read
the recipe one step at a time

Each codon corresponds to an amino acid â€“ just like each step in a
recipe refers to a specific ingredient

The amino acids are brought to the ribosome by tRNA â€“ these tRNA
molecules are like kitchen hands

The ribosome joins the amino acids together to make a polypeptide â€“
just like a cook mixes ingredients to make food

Pseudogenes

A transposon is a segment of DNA that inserts itself into another
section within the genome (i.e.Â â€˜jumping' genes)

-   Transposition often results in the duplication of the transposable
    element
-   If the duplicated sequence then undergoes random mutation, a
    pseudogene will result

A pseudogene is a non-functional sequence of DNA that is homologous to
an active gene

-   Pseudogenes may beÂ processed (retrotransposed) or non-processed
    (duplicated)

Processed pseudogenes

-   Arise when a portion of an mRNA transcript is reverse transcribed
    back into DNA and inserted into the chromosomal DNA
-   Processed pseudogenes consequently lack introns and promoter
    sequences, but may include a poly-A tract
-   These pseudogenes may be randomly integrated anywhere in the genome

Non-processed pseudogenes

-   Arise as a result of gene duplication and subsequent inactivation by
    mutation
-   Non-processed pseudogenes will often be flanked by transcriptional
    regulatory elements (e.g. promoters, etc.)
-   These pseudogenes are usually located adjacent to the original gene

Haber Process

The Haber process is an artificial nitrogen fixation process developed
by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch in 1910

-   It is currently the main industrial procedure for the production of
    ammonia

The Haber process involves the conversion of nitrogen and hydrogen gas
into ammonia using a metal catalyst:

-   Gases are passed over four beds of catalyst at high temperatures and
    high pressures
-   Between each pass the mixture is cooled and any unreacted gases are
    recycled
-   Each pass is only ~15% efficient, however recycling allows for a
    conversion rate of ~97%

The Haber process is used to make nitrogen-based fertilisers which can
be used for agricultural purposes

-   Currently, there is no comparable process for the artificial
    synthesis of phosphate-based fertilisers

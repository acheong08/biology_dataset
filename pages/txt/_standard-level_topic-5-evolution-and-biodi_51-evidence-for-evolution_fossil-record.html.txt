Understanding:

â€¢ Â The fossil record provides evidence for evolution

Â  Â Â 
Something provides evidence for evolution when it demonstrates a change
in characteristics from an ancestral form

-   The fossil record provides evidence by revealing the features of an
    ancestor for comparison against livingÂ descendantsÂ 

Fossils

A fossil is the preserved remains or traces of any organism from the
remote past

-   Preserved remains (body fossils) provide direct evidence of
    ancestral forms and include bones, teeth, shells, leaves, etc.
-   Traces provide indirect evidence of ancestral forms and include
    footprints, tooth marks, burrows and faeces (coprolite)

The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, is referred
to as the fossil record

-   The fossil record shows that over time changes have occurred in the
    features of living organisms (evolution)

Law of Fossil Succession

Fossils can be dated by determining the age of the rock layer (strata)
in which the fossil is found

-   Sedimentary rock layers develop in a chronological order, such that
    lower layers are older and newer strata form on top
-   Each strata represents a variable length of time that is classified
    according to a geological time scale (eons, eras, periods)

Different kinds of organisms are found in rocks of particular ages in a
consistent order, indicating a sequence of development

-   Prokaryotes appear in the fossil record before eukaryotes
-   Ferns appear in the fossil record before flowering plants
-   Invertebrates appear in the fossil record before vertebrate species

This chronological sequence of complexity by which characteristics
appear to develop is known as the law of fossil succession

-   This ordered succession of fossils suggests that newer species
    likely evolved as a result of changes to ancestral species

Transitional Fossils

While fossils may provide clues as to evolutionary relationships, it is
important to realise that the fossil record is incomplete

-   Fossilisation requires an unusual set of specific circumstances in
    order to occur, meaning very few organisms become fossils
-   Only the hard parts of an organism are typically preserved, meaning
    usually only fragments of remains are discovered
-   With limited fossil data, it can be difficult to discern the
    evolutionary patterns that result from ancestral forms (â€˜missing
    linksâ€™)

Transitional fossils demonstrate the intermediary forms that occurred
over the evolutionary pathway taken by a single genus

-   They establish the links between species by exhibiting traits common
    to both an ancestor and its predicted descendents
-   An example of a transitional fossil is archaeopteryx, which links
    the evolution of dinosaurs (jaws, claws) to birds (feathers)
-   As new fossils are discovered, new evolutionary patterns are
    emerging and old assumptions are challenged

Fossil Evidence

An example of how fossils provide evidence of evolution can be
established by comparingÂ hominin skeletons

-   Australopithecus is an early hominin ancestor that first appears in
    the fossil record approximately 4 million years ago
-   Comparing these fossils to the bone structure of modern man (Homo
    sapiens) demonstrates key evolutionary changes

These evolutionary trends (from Australopithecus to Homo sapiens)
include:

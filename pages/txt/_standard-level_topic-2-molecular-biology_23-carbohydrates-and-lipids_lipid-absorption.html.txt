Lipid Absorption

Lipids within the digestive system will tend to hydrophobically
aggregate to form large fat globules

-   Bile salts, secreted from the gall bladder, emulsify these fat
    globules and break them up into smaller droplets
-   Hydrolytic enzymes calledÂ lipases then digest the fats into their
    component parts

When the fatty acids are absorbed into the epithelial cells of the
intestinal lining, they are combined to form triglycerides

-   The triglycerides are combined with proteins inside the Golgi
    apparatus to form chylomicrons
-   Chylomicrons are released from the epithelial cells and are
    transported via the lacteals to the liver

While in the liver, chylomicrons may be modified to form a variety of
lipoproteins

-   Low density lipoproteins will transport lipids via the bloodstream
    to cells
-   High density lipoproteins will scavenge excess lipids from the
    bloodstream and tissues and return them to the liver

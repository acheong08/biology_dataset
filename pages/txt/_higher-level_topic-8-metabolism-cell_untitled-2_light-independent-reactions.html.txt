Understanding:

â€¢ Â In the light independent reactions a carboxylase catalyses the
carboxylation of ribulose bisphosphate

Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
The light independent reactions use the chemical energy derived from
light dependent reactions to form organic molecules

-   The light independent reactions occur in the fluid-filled space of
    the chloroplast called the stroma

The light independent reactions are collectively known as the Calvin
cycle and involve three main steps:

-   Carboxylation of ribulose bisphosphate
-   Reduction ofÂ glycerate-3-phosphate
-   Regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate

Step 1: Â Carbon Fixation

-   The Calvin cycle begins with a 5C compound called ribulose
    bisphosphate (or RuBP)
-   An enzyme, RuBP carboxylase (or Rubisco), catalyses the attachment
    of a CO₂ molecule to RuBP
-   The resulting 6C compound is unstable, and breaks down into two 3C
    compounds â€“ calledÂ glycerate-3-phosphate (GP)
-   A single cycle involves three molecules of RuBP combining with three
    molecules of CO₂ to make six molecules of GP

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Glycerate-3-phosphate is reduced to triose phosphate using reduced
NADP and ATP

Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
Step 2: Â Reduction of Glycerate-3-Phosphate

-   Glycerate-3-phosphate (GP) is converted into triose phosphate (TP)
    using NADPH and ATP
-   Reduction by NADPH transfers hydrogen atoms to the compound, while
    the hydrolysis of ATP provides energy
-   Each GP requires one NADPH and one ATP to form a triose phosphate
    â€“ so a single cycle requires six of each molecule

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Triose phosphate is used to regenerate RuBP and produce
carbohydrates

â€¢ Â Ribulose bisphosphate is reformed using ATP

Â  Â Â 
Step 3: Â Regeneration of RuBP

-   Of the six molecules of TP produced per cycle, one TP molecule may
    be used to form half a sugar molecule
-   Hence two cycles are required to produce a single glucose monomer,
    and more to produce polysaccharides like starch
-   The remaining five TP molecules are recombined to regenerate stocks
    of RuBP Â (5Â Ã— 3C = 3Â Ã— 5C)Â 
-   The regeneration of RuBP requires energy derived from the hydrolysis
    of ATP

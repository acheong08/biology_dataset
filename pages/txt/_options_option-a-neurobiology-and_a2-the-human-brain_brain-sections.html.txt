Understanding:

â€¢ Â Different parts of the brain have specific roles

Â  Â Â 
The human brain acts as an integration and coordination system for the
control of body systems

-   It processes sensory information received from the body and relays
    motor responses to effector organ

The human brain is organised into clearly identifiable sections that
have specific roles

-   The major external structures include the cerebral cortex,
    cerebellum and brainstem
-   Internal structures include the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and
    corpusÂ callosum

External Structures

Cerebral Cortex

-   The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of tissue organised into two
    cerebral hemispheres and composed of four distinct lobes
-   The frontal lobe controls motor activity and tasks associated with
    the dopamine system (memory, attention, etc.)
-   The parietal lobe is responsible for touch sensation (tactility) as
    well as spatial navigation (proprioception)
-   The temporal lobe is involved in auditory processing and language
    comprehension
-   The occipital lobe is the visual processing centre of the brain and
    is responsible for sight perception

Cerebellum

-   The cerebellum appears as a separate structure at the base of the
    brain, underneath the cerebral hemispheres
-   It is responsible for coordinating unconscious motor functions â€“
    such as balance and movement coordination

Brainstem

-   The brainstem is the posterior part of the brain that connects to
    the spinal cord (which relays signals to and from the body)Â 
-   The brainstem includes the pons, medulla oblongata (often referred
    to as the medulla) and the midbrain
-   The brainstem (via the medulla) controls automatic and involuntary
    activities (breathing, swallowing, heart rate, etc.)Â

Internal Structures

Hypothalamus

-   The hypothalamus is the region of the brain that functions as the
    interface with the pituitary gland
-   As such, the hypothalamus functions to maintain homeostasis via the
    coordination of the nervous and endocrine systems
-   The hypothalamus also produces some hormones directly, which are
    secreted via the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis)

Pituitary Gland

-   The pituitary gland is considered theÂ â€˜masterâ€™ gland â€“ it
    produces hormones that regulate other glands and target organs
-   The anterior lobe is called the adenohypophysis and secretes
    hormones such as FSH, LH, growth hormone and prolactin
-   The posterior lobe is called the neurohypophysis and secretes
    hormones such as ADH and oxytocin

Corpus Callosum

-   The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibres that connects the
    two cerebral hemispheres
-   It is the largest white matter structure in the brain, consisting of
    roughly 250 million axon projections
-   Damage to the corpus callosum can prevent information exchange
    between left and right hemispheres (split brain disorders)

D4 Â The Heart

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Internal and external factors
influence heart function

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Structure of cardiac muscle cells allows propagation of stimuli
    through the heart wall
-   Signals from the sinoatrial node that cause contraction cannot pass
    directly from atria to ventricles
-   There is a delay between the arrival and passing on of a stimulus at
    the atrioventricular node
-   This delay allows time for atrial systole before the
    atrioventricular valves close
-   Conducting fibres ensure coordinated contraction of the entire
    ventricle wall
-   Normal heart sounds are caused by the atrioventricular valves and
    semilunar valves closing causing changes in blood flow

Applications:

-   Use of artificial pacemakers to regulate the heart rate
-   Use of defibrillation to treat life-threatening cardiac conditions
-   Causes and consequences of hypertension and thrombosis

Skills:

-   Measurement and interpretation of the heart rate under different
    conditions
-   Interpretation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements
-   Mapping of the cardiac cycle to a normal ECG trace
-   Analysis of epidemiological data relating to the incidence of
    coronary heart disease

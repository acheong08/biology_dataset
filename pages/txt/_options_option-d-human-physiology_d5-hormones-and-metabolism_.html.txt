D5 Â Hormones and Metabolism

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Hormones are not secreted at a uniform rate
and exert their effect at low concentrations

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream
-   Steroid hormones bind to receptor proteins in the cytoplasm of the
    target cell to form a receptor-hormone complex
-   The receptor-hormone complex promotes the transcription of specific
    genes
-   Peptide hormones bind to receptors in the plasma membrane of the
    target cell
-   Binding of hormones to membrane receptors activates a cascade
    mediated by a second messenger inside the cell
-   The hypothalamus controls hormone secretion by the anterior and
    posterior lobes of the pituitary gland
-   Hormones secreted by the pituitary control growth, developmental
    changes, reproduction and homeostasis

Applications:

-   Some athletes take growth hormones to build muscles
-   Control of milk secretion by oxytocin and prolactin

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hydrogen bonding and dipolarity explain the cohesive, adhesive,
thermal and solvent properties of water

Â  Â Â 
The dipolarity of a water molecule enables it to form polar associations
with other charged molecules (polar or ionic)

Water can form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules (between
aÂ Î´⁺Â hydrogen and aÂ Î´^(â€“)Â oxygen of two molecules)

Hydrogen Bonding between Water Molecules

[hydrogen bonding]

Properties of Water

This intermolecular bonding between water molecules gives water distinct
properties not seen in other substances:

-   Thermal properties â€“ Water can absorb much heat before changing
    state (requires breaking of hydrogen bonds)
-   Cohesive / adhesive properties â€“ Water willÂ â€˜stickâ€™Â to other
    water molecules (cohesion) and charged substances (adhesion)
-   Solvent properties â€“ Water dissolves polar and ionic substances
    (forms competing polar associations to draw materials apart)

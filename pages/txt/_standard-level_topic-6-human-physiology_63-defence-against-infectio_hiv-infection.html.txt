â€¢ Â Effects of HIV on the immune system and methods of transmission

Â  Â Â 
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that infects
helper T cells, disabling the bodyâ€™s adaptive immune system

-   It causes a variety of symptoms and infections collectively classed
    as Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

Effects of HIV

-   HIV specifically targets the helper T lymphocytes which regulate the
    adaptive immune system
-   Following infection, the virus undergoes a period of inactivity
    (clinical latency) during which infected helper T cells reproduce
-   Eventually, the virus becomes active again and begins to spread,
    destroying the T lymphocytes in the process (lysogenic cycle)
-   With a reduction in the number of helper T cells, antibodies are
    unable to be produced, resulting in a lowered immunity
-   The body becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections, eventually
    resulting in death if the condition is not managed

Progression of AIDS

Transmission of HIV

-   HIV is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids (including
    unprotected sex, blood transfusions, breastfeeding, etc.)
-   The risk of exposure to HIV through sexual contact can be minimised
    by using latex protection (i.e. condoms)
-   A small minority of people are immune to HIV infection (they lack
    the CD4+ receptor on T_(H) cells that HIV requires for docking)
-   HIV is a global issue, but is particularly prevalent in poorer
    nations with poor education and health systems

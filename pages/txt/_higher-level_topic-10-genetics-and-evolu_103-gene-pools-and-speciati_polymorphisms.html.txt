Polymorphisms

A polymorphism is the occurrence of two or more clearly different
phenotypes within the same population of a species

-   Whereas alleles are the individual components of a gene,
    polymorphisms are the individual components of a traits
-   Consequently, polymorphisms reflect the involvement of more than one
    allele for any given gene in the gene pool

Transient Polymorphisms

Occurs when there are two alleles in the gene pool and one allele is
gradually replacing the other

This is due to a strong environmental pressure causing directional
selection to eliminate one allele from the gene pool

Example: Â Light vs dark melanic variants of the peppered moth
(direction of selection determined by environment)

Balanced Polymorphisms

Occurs when there are two alleles in the gene pool and the frequency of
the two alleles is not changing

This is due to selective pressures promoting the coexistence of two
alleles (heterozygous advantage) via stabilising selection

Example: Â Sickle cell anaemia in African nations (heterozygotes do not
develop anaemia but have resistance to malaria)

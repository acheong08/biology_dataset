Understanding:

â€¢ Â Richness and evenness are components of biodiversity

Â  Â Â 
Biodiversity describes the variety and variability of all living
organisms within a given ecological area

-   Biodiversity can be used to refer to the number of species, their
    genetic diversity or habitat variety (ecological variations)

There are two main components that contribute to biodiversity â€“
species richness and species evenness

-   Species richness describes the number of different species present
    in an area (more species = greater richness)
-   Species evenness describes the relative abundance of the different
    species in an area (similar abundance = more evenness)

Biodiversity (Richness versus Evenness)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of the biodiversity of two local communities using
Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal index of diversity

Â  Â Â 
The Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal index can be used to measure the relative
biodiversity of a given community

-   It takes into account both the number of species present (richness)
    and the number of individuals per species (evenness)
-   A higher index value is indicative of a greater degree of
    biodiversity within the community

[Simpson Index]

Simpsonâ€™s reciprocal index can be used to compare communities to
identify intrinsic qualities:

-   A high index value suggests a stable site with many different niches
    and low competition (high richness and evenness)
-   A low index value suggests a site with few potential niches where
    only a few species dominate (low richness and evenness)
-   The index value may change in response to an ecological disturbance
    (such as human intervention or natural disasters)

Practice Question

[question]
Use Simpson's reciprocal index to compare the biodiversity at two
specific locations:
Site 1: Species A = 6 ; Species B = 1 ; Species C = 1
Site 2: Species A = 4 ; Species D = 4

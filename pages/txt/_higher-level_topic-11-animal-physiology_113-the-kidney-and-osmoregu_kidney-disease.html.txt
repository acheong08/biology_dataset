Application:

â€¢ Â Blood cells, glucose, proteins and drugs are detected in urinary
tests

Â  Â Â 
Kidney diseases are conditions which incapacitate the kidneyâ€™s ability
to filter waste products from the blood

-   Individuals with kidney diseases will demonstrate a reduced
    glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
-   If untreated, kidney diseases can lead to kidney failure â€“ which
    is life threatening

Urinary Analysis

Kidneys prevent the excretion of blood cells and proteins (during
ultrafiltration), as well as glucose (selective reabsorption)

-   Hence the presence of these materials in urine can be used as an
    indicator of disease

Glucose: Â The presence of glucose in urine is a common indicator of
diabetes (high blood glucose = incomplete reabsorption)

Proteins: Â High quantities of protein in urine may indicate disease
(e.g. PKU) or hormonal conditions (e.g. hCG = pregnancy)

Blood cells: Â The presence of blood in urine can indicate a variety of
diseases, including certain infections and cancer

Drugs / toxins: Â Many drugs pass through the body into urine and can be
detected (e.g. performance enhancing drugs)

Application:

â€¢ Â Treatment of kidney failure by hemodialysis or kidney transplant

Â  Â Â 
Hemodialysis

Kidney dialysis involves the external filtering of blood in order to
remove metabolic wastes in patients with kidney failureÂ 

Blood is removed and pumped through a dialyzer, which has two key
functions that are common to biological membranes:

-   It contains a porous membrane that isÂ semi-permeableÂ (restricts
    passage of certain materials)
-   It introduces fresh dialysis fluid and removes wastes to maintain an
    appropriateÂ concentration gradient

Kidney dialysis treatments typically last about 4 hours and occur 3
times a week â€“ these treatments can be effective for years

Kidney Transplant

Hemodialysis ensures continued blood filtering, but does not address the
underlying issue affecting kidney function

The best long-term treatment for kidney failure is a kidney transplant:

-   The transplanted kidney is grafted into the abdomen, with arteries,
    veins and ureter connected to the recipientâ€™s vessels
-   Donors must typically be a close genetic match in order to minimise
    the potential for graft rejection
-   Donors can survive with one kidney and so may commonly donate the
    second to relative suffering kidney failure

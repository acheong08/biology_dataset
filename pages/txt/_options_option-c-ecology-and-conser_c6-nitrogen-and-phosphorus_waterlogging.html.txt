Application:

â€¢ Â The impact of waterlogging on the nitrogen cycle

Â  Â Â 
Waterlogging occurs when the soil becomes inundated with water, either
through flooding or irrigation with poor drainage

-   Waterlogging impacts the nitrogen cycle by reducing the levels of
    nitrates and nitrites in the soil

Waterlogged soil will lose nitrates and nitrites via the process of
denitrification

-   Waterlogging reduces oxygen availability in the soil, creating
    oxygen-poor conditions favoured by denitrifying bacteria
-   This bacteria (Pseudomonas) will convert available stocks of
    nitrates into nitrogen gas, reducing soil nitrogen content

Waterlogged soil will also lose nitrates and nitrites via the process of
leaching

-   Whenever rainfall exceeds evaporation, there will be a build up of
    water within the porous soil
-   As this water drains downwards through the soil, soluble minerals
    (like nitrates and nitrites) are removed with it
-   Continual leaching impoverishes the upper layers of soil and
    concentrates dissolved minerals in the lower bedrock
-   Leaching is most common in highly porous soils (e.g. sandy soils)
    and least common in textured soils (such as clay)

Application:

â€¢ Â Insectivorous plants as an adaptation for low nitrogen
availability in waterlogged soils

Â  Â Â 
A primary consequence of waterlogging is the reduction in nitrogen
availability within the soil

-   This means that plants are unable to access sufficient quantities of
    nitrogen from the soil via their roots

Insectivorous plants are able to obtain nitrogen in low-nutrient
environments by feeding on invertebrates

-   Insectivorous plants include the Venus fly trap, which is native to
    subtropical wetlands that have waterlogged soil
-   The plantâ€™s terminal leaves form a trapping structure that is
    baited by nectar to attract insects
-   When trapping has occurred, the plant releases digestive enzymes
    that allow it to absorb nutrients from the insect
-   Insectivorous plants only obtain nitrogen from feeding on insects
    â€“ they still derive energy from photosynthesis

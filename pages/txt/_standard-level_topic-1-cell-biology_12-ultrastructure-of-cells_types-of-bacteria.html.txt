Types of Bacteria

All bacteria share features common to every prokaryotic cell:

-   They lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles
-   They have circular DNA that is naked (not bound to protein)
-   They have smaller ribosomes (70S)

However different types of bacteria can be distinguished according to a
number of characteristics:

-   Shape â€“ Round (coccus), rod-like (bacillus), comma-shaped (vibrio)
    or spiral (spirilla / spirochete)
-   Cell wall composition â€“ Gram-positive (thick peptidoglycan layer)
    or Gram-negative (lipopolysaccharide layer)
-   Gaseous requirements â€“ Anaerobic (obligate or facultative) or
    aerobic
-   Nutritional patterns â€“ Autotrophic (photosynthetic or
    chemosynthetic) or heterotrophic

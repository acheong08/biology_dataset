Understanding:

â€¢ Â Global temperatures and climate patterns are influenced by
concentration of greenhouse gases

Â  Â Â 
Greenhouse gases play a pivotal role in determining global temperatures
and climate patterns due to their capacity to retain heat

-   As these gases trap heat, increases in greenhouse gas concentrations
    should correlate with an increase in global temperatureÂ 
-   Long term weather patterns (climate) may also be influenced by
    greenhouse gas concentrations

Scientists predict that increases in greenhouse gas concentrations will
lead to an enhanced greenhouse effect, resulting in:

-   More frequent extreme weather conditions (e.g. heat waves, cyclones,
    more powerful tropical storms, etc.)
-   Some areas to become more drought affected, while other areas become
    more prone to periods of heavy rainfall
-   Changes to circulating ocean currents â€“ which may cause longer El
    Nino (warming) and La Nina (cooling) events

Application:

â€¢ Â Correlations between global temperatures and carbon dioxide
concentrations on Earth

Â  Â Â 
The link between global temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations
was established by analysing data over a long time period

-   Ice cores taken from the Vostok station in Antarctica provide
    evidence of the environmental conditions at the time of freezing
-   The Vostok ice core is one of the longest drilled, reaching back
    420,000 years and covering the past four glacial cycles
-   By analysing the gas bubbles trapped in ice, historical CO₂ levels
    and air temperatures (via oxygen isotopes) can be deduced

Data collected from the Vostok ice core demonstrates that:

-   There is a strong positive correlation between carbon dioxide
    concentrations and temperature (â†‘ CO₂ levelsÂ âˆ?Â â†‘
    temperature)
-   There have been fluctuating cycles of CO₂ concentrations which
    appear to correlate with global warm ages and ice ages
-   Current concentrations of CO₂ are higher than at any time recorded
    in the last 400,000 years

Understanding:

â€¢ Â There is a correlation between rising atmospheric concentrations
of carbon dioxide since the start of theÂ 

Â  Â Â industrial revolution 200 years ago and average global
temperatures

Â  Â Â 
The industrial revolution introduced new manufacturing processes which
significantly increased mankindâ€™s use of fossil fuels

-   The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide as a by-product,
    leading to a steadyÂ increase in itsÂ atmospheric concentration

When fuel emissions, atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and global
temperatures are compared, the following trends are revealed:

-   There is a strong positive correlation between increasing fossil
    fuel emissions and rising atmospheric concentrations of CO₂
-   Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations have increased ~38% since
    pre-industrial times (1800: ~ 280 ppm ; 2010: ~ 380 ppm)
-   About 40% of CO₂ emissions have remained in the atmosphere, the rest
    has been absorbed by carbon sinks (mainly oceans)
-   This increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration correlates
    with an increase in average global temperature
-   While correlation does not equal causation, there is mounting
    evidence to suggest that CO₂ emissions are linked to global
    temperature changes (although other factors likely also contribute)

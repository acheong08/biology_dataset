Understanding:

â€¢ Â Enzyme catalysis involves molecular motion and the collision of
substrates with the active site

Â  Â Â 
Enzyme reactions typically occur in aqueous solutions (e.g. cytoplasm,
interstitial fluid, etc.)

-   Consequently, the substrate and enzyme are usually moving randomly
    within the solution (Brownian motion)
-   Sometimes an enzyme may be fixed in position (e.g. membrane-bound)
    â€“ this serves to localise reactions to particular sites

Enzyme Catalysis

Enzyme catalysis requires that the substrate be brought into close
physical proximity with the active site

-   When a substrate binds to the enzymeâ€™s active site, an
    enzyme-substrate complex is formed
-   The enzyme catalyses the conversion of the substrate into product,
    creating an enzyme-product complex
-   The enzyme and product then dissociate â€“ as the enzyme was not
    consumed, it can continue to catalyse further reactionsÂ 

Enzyme-Substrate Interactions

Collision Frequency

The rate of enzyme catalysis can be increased by improving the frequency
of collisions via:

-   Increasing the molecular motion of the particles (thermal energy can
    be introduced to increase kinetic energy)
-   Increasing the concentration of particles (either substrate or
    enzyme concentrations)

Gene Therapy

Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individualâ€™s cells to
treat hereditary diseases by replacing defective alleles

-   It differs from standard transgenic practices in that it is intended
    to transform existing organisms rather than create new ones
-   Viral vectors are typically used, due to their ability to integrate
    DNA into the hostâ€™s genome
-   The process involves removing cells from a patient and using a viral
    vector to introduce aÂ functional copy of the defective gene
-   When the cells are transplanted back into the patient, they should
    begin expressing the missing protein to restore normal healthÂ 

An example of the successful use of gene therapy in humans is in the
treatment of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiencyÂ 

-   ADA deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease that causes severe
    combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in sufferers
-   The disorder results from an inability to synthesise the enzyme ADA,
    which is needed for the safe breakdown of a toxic chemical
-   Individuals who have undergone gene therapy have shown a steady
    increase in the levels of ADA in their cells

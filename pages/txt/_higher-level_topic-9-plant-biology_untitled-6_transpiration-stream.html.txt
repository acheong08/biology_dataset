The flow of water through the xylem from the roots to the leaf, against
gravity, is called the transpiration stream

-   Water rises through xylem vessels due to two key properties of water
    â€“ cohesion and adhesion

Cohesion:

-   Cohesion is the force of attraction between two particles of the
    same substance (e.g. between two water molecules)
-   Water molecules are polar and can form a type of intermolecular
    association called a hydrogen bond
-   This cohesive property causes water molecules to be dragged up the
    xylem towards the leaves in a continuous stream

Adhesion:

-   Adhesion is the force of attraction between two particles of
    different substances (e.g. water molecule and xylem wall)
-   The xylem wall is also polar and hence can form intermolecular
    associations with water molecules
-   As water molecules move up the xylem via capillary action, they pull
    inward on the xylem walls to generate further tension

Structure of the Xylem

The xylem is a specialised structure that functions to facilitate the
movement of water throughout the plant

-   It is a tube composed of dead cells that are hollow (no protoplasm)
    to allow for the free movement of water
-   Because the cells are dead, the movement of water is an entirely
    passive process and occurs in one direction only
-   The cell wall contains numerous pores (called pits), which enables
    water to be transferred between cells
-   Walls have thickened cellulose and are reinforced by lignin, so as
    to provide strength as water is transported under tension

Basic Xylem Structure

[xylem]

Xylems can be composed of tracheids (all vascular plants) and vessel
elements (certain vascular plants only)

-   Tracheids are tapered cells that exchange water solely via pits,
    leading to a slower rate of water transfer
-   In vessel elements, the end walls have become fused to form a
    continuous tube, resulting in a faster rate of water transfer

All xylem vessels are reinforced by lignin, which may be deposited in
different ways:

-   In annular vessels, the lignin forms a pattern of circular rings at
    equal distances from each other
-   In spiral vessels, the lignin is present in the form of a helix or
    coilÂ

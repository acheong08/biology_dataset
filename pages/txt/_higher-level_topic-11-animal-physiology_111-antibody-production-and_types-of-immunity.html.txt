Types of Immunity

Immunity can be described as either active or passive, depending on how
it is acquired:

-   Active immunity involves the production of antibodies by the body
    itself and the subsequent development of memory cells
-   Passive immunity results from the acquisition of antibodies from
    another source and hence memory cells are not developed

Active immunity will result in long-term immunity but passive immunity
will not (due to the presence or absence of memory cells)Â 

-   Both active and passive immunity can be induced by either natural or
    artificial mechanisms

Examples of Active Immunity

-   Natural â€“ Producing antibodies in response to exposure to a
    pathogenic infection (i.e. challenge and response)
-   Artificial â€“ Producing antibodies in response to the controlled
    exposure to an attenuated pathogen (i.e. vaccination)Â 

Examples of Passive Immunity

-   Natural â€“ Receiving antibodies from another organism (e.g. to the
    foetus via the colostrum or a newborn via breast milk)
-   Artificial â€“ Receiving manufactured antibodies via external
    delivery (e.g blood transfusions of monoclonal antibodies)

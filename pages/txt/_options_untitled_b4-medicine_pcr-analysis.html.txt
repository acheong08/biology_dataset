â€¢ Â Use of PCR to detect different strains of influenza virus

Â  Â  Â Â 
Influenza is caused by an RNA virus that can rapidly mutate to exist as
distinctive serotypes (i.e. different strains exist)

-   These strains will have different glycoprotein antigens and hence
    engender different antibody responses
-   Identifying the specific strain of influenza virus in an infected
    individual will help in the selection of optimal drug treatments

Different strains of influenza can be detected using a modified PCR
protocol

-   Amplification of the virus requires the conversion of its RNA
    sequences into cDNA (reverse transcription via RT-PCR)
-   Because several different strains of the influenza virus exist,
    appropriate primers need to be selected to reflect this range

Specific strains of influenza virus can be detected using molecular
beacons that target sequences unique to a given strain

-   A molecular beacon is a hairpin-shaped nucleotide sequence with an
    internally quenched fluorophore molecule
-   When the beacon anneals to a complementary target sequence, the
    hairpin unfolds and fluorescence is restored
-   Hence, different strains of influenza virus can be detected
    following RT-PCR amplification according to fluorescence

â€¢ Â Quantitative representations of energy flow using pyramids of
energy

Â  Â Â 
A pyramid of energy is a graphical representation of the amount of
energy at each trophic level of a food chain

-   They are expressed in units of energy per area per time (e.g. kJ
    m^(â€“2) year^(â€“1))

Pyramids of energy will never appear inverted as some of the energy
stored in one source is always lost upon transfer

-   Each level should be roughly one tenth of the size of the preceding
    level (as energy transformations are ~10% efficient)
-   The bottom level will always represent the producers, with
    subsequent levels representing consumers (primary, secondary, etc.)

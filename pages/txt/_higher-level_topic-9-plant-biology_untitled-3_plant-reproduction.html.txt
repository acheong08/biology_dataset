Understanding:

â€¢ Â Success in plant reproduction depends on pollination,
fertilization and seed dispersal

Â  Â Â 
Plants can reproduce in a number of different ways:

-   Vegetative propagation (asexual reproduction from a plant cutting)
-   Spore formations (e.g. moulds, ferns)
-   Pollen transfer (flowering plants â€“ angiospermophytes)

Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the transfer of pollen
(male gamete) to an ova (female gamete)

-   This involves three distinct phases â€“ pollination, fertilization
    and seed dispersal

Pollination:

-   The transfer of pollen grains from an anther (male plant structure)
    to a stigma (female plant structure)
-   Many plants possess both male and female structures (monoecious) and
    can potentially self-pollinate
-   From an evolutionary perspective, cross-pollination is preferable as
    it improves genetic diversity

Fertilisation:

-   Fusion of a male gamete nuclei with a female gamete nuclei to form a
    zygote
-   In plants, the male gamete is stored in the pollen grain and the
    female gamete is found in the ovule

Seed dispersal:

-   Fertilisation of gametes results in the formation of a seed, which
    moves away from the parental plant
-   This seed dispersal reduces competition for resources between the
    germinating seed and the parental plant
-   There are a variety of seed dispersal mechanisms, including wind,
    water, fruits and animals
    -   Seed structure will vary depending on the mechanism of dispersal
        employed by the plant

Plant Reproduction Stages

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Most flowering plants use mutualistic relationships with
pollinators in sexual reproduction

Â  Â Â 
Cross-pollination involves transferring pollen grains from one plant to
the ovule of a different plant

-   Pollen can be transferred by wind or water, but is commonly
    transferred by animals (called pollinators)

Pollinators are involved in a mutualistic relationship with the
flowering plant â€“ whereby both species benefit from the interaction

-   The flowering plant gains a means of sexual reproduction (via
    theÂ transference of pollen between plants)
-   The animal gains a source of nutrition (plants secrete a sugar-rich
    substance called nectar to attract pollinators

Common examples of pollinators include birds, bats and insects
(including bees and butterflies)

-   Flowers may be structured to optimise access for certain pollinators
    (e.g. tube-shaped flowers for birds with long beaks)

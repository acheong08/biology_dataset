C5 Â Population Ecology

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Dynamic biological processes impact
population density and population growth

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Sampling techniques are used to estimate population size
-   The exponential growth pattern occurs in an ideal, unlimited
    environment
-   Population growth slows as the population reaches the carrying
    capacity of the environment
-   The phases shown in the sigmoid curve can be explained by relative
    rates of natality, mortality, immigraton and emigration
-   Limiting factors can be top down or bottom up

Applications:

-   Evaluating the methods used to estimate the size of commercial stock
    of marine resources
-   Use of the capture-mark-release-recapture method to estimate the
    population size of an animal species
-   Discussion of the effect of natality, mortality, immigration and
    emigration on population size
-   Analysis of the effect of population size, age and reproductive
    status on sustainable fishing practices
-   Bottom-up control of algal blooms by shortage of nutrients and
    top-down control by herbivory

Skills:

-   Modelling the growth curve using a simple organism such as yeast or
    species of Lemna

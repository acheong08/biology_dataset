Menstrual Events

The changes in reproductive hormones over the menstrual cycle trigger
many physiological and behavioural responses

Below are listed some of these key changes, beginning and ending with
menstruation (day 0 / day 28):

-   Day 1 â€“ 5: Â The average period lasts ~ 5 days, during which the
    body may release prostaglandins (causing cramps)
-   Day 6 â€“ 11: Â Estrogen levels rise during the follicular phase,
    making a woman feel more confident and flirtatious
-   Day 12 â€“ 15: Â Nearing ovulation, the woman will be most fertile
    â€“ this is the best (or worst!) time to try for pregnancy
-   Day 14 â€“ 15: Â With ovulation, estrogen levels drop temporarily,
    which may lead a woman to feel cranky or emotional
-   Day 16 â€“ 19: Â Estrogen and progesterone release prepare for
    pregnancy and can lead to breast tenderness
-   Day 20 â€“ 21: Â If fertilisation hasnâ€™t occurred by this point,
    the ovaries will stop producing estrogen and progesterone
-   Day 22 â€“ 28: Â Falling levels of hormones will cause irritability
    and may lead to craving for sugary foods (beware zits!)

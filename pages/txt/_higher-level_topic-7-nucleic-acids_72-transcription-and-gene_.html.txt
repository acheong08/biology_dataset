7.2 Â Transcription and Gene Expression

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Information stored as a code in DNA Â 
is copied onto mRNA

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Transcription occurs in a 5â€™Â to 3â€™Â direction
-   Nucleosomes help to regulate transcription in eukaryotes
-   Eukaryotic cells modify mRNA after transcription
-   Splicing of mRNA increases the number of different proteins an
    organism can produce
-   Gene expression is regulated by proteins that bind to specific base
    sequences in DNA
-   The environment of a cell and of an organism has an impact on gene
    expression

Applications:

-   The promoter as an example of non-coding DNA with a function

Skills:

-   Analysis of changes in the DNA methylation patterns

Application:

â€¢ Â Some athletes take growth hormones to build muscles

Â  Â Â 
Growth hormone (also known as somatotropin) is an anabolic peptide
hormone that stimulates growth

-   It acts directly to reduce the formation of adipose cells (i.e. less
    nutrients stored as fat)
-   It acts indirectly via insulin growth factor (IGF) â€“ produced by
    the liver â€“ to increase muscle mass and bone size

Due to its role in promoting growth and regeneration, it is used by some
athletes as a performance enhancer

-   The use of human growth hormone is banned in sports, with proven
    cases of doping strictly punished
-   Traditional urine testing could not detect doping, which
    historically made bans difficult to enforce
-   Recent blood tests can now identify between natural and artificial
    variants of growth hormone

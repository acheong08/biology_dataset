Polyploidy

Sexual reproduction requires chromosomal content to be halved in the sex
cells to produce haploid gametes

-   The process by which haploid gametes are created is called meiosis
    (meiosis I is the reduction division)
-   Fusion of two haploid gametes creates a diploid zygote that can then
    grow and develop via mitotic division

If meiotic formation of haploid gametes did not precede fertilisation,
chromosomal content would double every generation

-   Polyploidy is a condition whereby an organism has more than two
    complete sets of chromosomes in all cells (i.e. > diploid)
-   Polyploidy is far more common in plant species which lack separate
    sexes and are capable of self-pollination
-   Polyploidy is very rare in animal species due to the consequences of
    having extra allele copies of every gene

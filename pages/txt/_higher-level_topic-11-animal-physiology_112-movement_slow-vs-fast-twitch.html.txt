Slow vs Fast Twitch

There are two different types of skeletal muscle fibres that are used to
facilitate movement:
Slow Twitch Fibres

-   Slow twitch fibres are used for muscular endurance â€“ they contract
    slowly but do not fatigue easily
-   Slow twitch fibres use oxygen for aerobic respiration, have a large
    amount of mitochondria and many blood vessels
-   Slow twitch fibres are typically red in colour due to the dense
    supply of capillaries
-   Slow twitch fibres are prevalent in endurance athletes, such as
    marathon runners

Fast Twitch Fibres

-   Fast twitch fibres are used for muscular strength â€“ they contract
    rapidly but fatigue easily
-   Fast twitch fibres respire anaerobically and consequently possess
    less mitochondria and have fewer blood vessels
-   Fast twitch fibres are typically lighter in colour (white)
-   Fast twitch fibres are prevalent in strength athletes, such as
    sprinters

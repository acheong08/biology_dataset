Understanding:

â€¢ Â The distribution of a species is affected by limiting factors

Â  Â Â 
In ecology, a limiting factor is a component of an ecosystem which
limits the distribution or numbers of a population

-   A limiting factor defines optimal survival conditions according to
    its effect on a species when in deficiency or excess

Limiting factors can be either biotic (living) or abiotic (non-living):

-   Biotic factors include interactions between organisms â€“ either
    intraspecific (within species) or interspecific (between species)
-   Abiotic factors include environmental conditions â€“ such as light,
    temperature, salinity, rainfall, wind velocity, soil pH, etc.

Law of Tolerance

The law of tolerance was proposed by an American zoologist â€“ Victor
Ernest Shelford â€“ in 1911

-   According to the law of tolerance, populations have optimal survival
    conditions within critical minimal and maximal thresholds
-   As a population is exposed to the extremes of a particular limiting
    factor, the rates of survival begin to drop

The distribution of a species in response to a limiting factor can be
represented as a bell-shaped curve with 3 distinct regions:

-   Optimal zone â€“ Central portion of curve which has conditions that
    favour maximal reproductive success and survivability
-   Zones of stress â€“ Regions flanking the optimal zone, where
    organisms can survive but with reduced reproductive success
-   Zones of intolerance â€“ Outermost regions in which organisms cannot
    survive (represents extremes of the limiting factor)

Application:

â€¢ Â Distribution of one animal and one plant species to illustrate
limits to tolerance and zones of stress

Â  Â Â 
Plant Example

Plant growth varies greatly in response to concentrations of salt within
the soil (salinity levels)

-   Plant species that are not particularly salt tolerant are called
    glycophytes â€“ these plants are easily damaged by high salinity
-   Plant species that are salt tolerant are called halophytes â€“ these
    plants may become stressed in freshwater environments

Most plant species are considered to be glycophytes â€“ relatively few
plant species are halophytes (~ less than 2%)

-   Cultivation of land for agriculture (e.g. irrigation or grazing)
    causes the water table to rise and concentrates salt at the roots
-   This makes it harder for glycophytes to extract water from the soil
    (also, the uptake of salt can be toxic to the plant)
-   Understanding salt tolerance for different plant species is
    therefore critically important to effective crop farming

Animal Example

Coral species form connected reefs that are greatly impacted by changes
in oceanic temperature

-   Coral polyps receive nutrition from photosynthetic zooxanthellae (an
    algae) that lives within the polypâ€™s endodermis
-   The zooxanthellae cannot survive in lower ocean temperatures (i.e. <
    18ÂºC)
-   Increases in ocean temperature cause zooxanthellae to leave the
    coral tissue, leading to coral bleachingÂ (i.e. > 35ÂºC)

Reef-building coral species therefore have a typical optimal growth
range in temperate waters between 20 â€“ 30ÂºC

-   This correlates to the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the
    world (i.e. near the equator)

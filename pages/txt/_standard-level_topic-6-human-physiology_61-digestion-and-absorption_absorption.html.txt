Understanding:

â€¢ Â Different methods of membrane transport are required to absorb
different nutrients

Â  Â Â 
During absorption, digested food monomers must pass from the lumen into
the epithelial lining of the small intestine

-   Tight junctions between epithelial cells occlude any gaps between
    cells â€“ all monomers must cross the membrane
-   Different monomers undertake different methods for crossing the
    apical and basolateral membranes

Membrane Transport Mechanisms

Secondary Active Transport

-   A transport protein couples the active translocation of one molecule
    to the passive movement of another (co-transport)
-   Glucose and amino acids are co-transported across the epithelial
    membrane by the active translocation of sodium ions (Na⁺)

Facilitated Diffusion

-   Channel proteins help hydrophilic food molecules pass through the
    hydrophobic portion of the plasma membrane
-   Channel proteins are often situated near specific membrane-bound
    enzymes (creates a localised concentration gradient)
-   Certain monosaccharides (e.g. fructose), vitamins and some minerals
    are transported by facilitated diffusion

Osmosis

-   Water molecules will diffuse across the membrane in response to the
    movement of ions and hydrophilic monomers (solutes)
-   The absorption of water and dissolved ions occurs in both the small
    and large intestine

Simple Diffusion

-   Hydrophobic materials (e.g. lipids) may freely pass through the
    hydrophobic portion of the plasma membrane
-   Once absorbed, lipids will often pass first into the lacteals rather
    than being transported via the blood

Bulk Transport

Endocytosis

-   Endocytosis involves the invagination of the plasma membrane to
    create an internal vesicle containing extracellular material
-   Vesicle formation requires the breaking and reforming of the
    phospholipid bilayer and hence is an energy-dependent process
-   In the intestines, vesicles commonly form around fluid containing
    dissolved materials (pinocytosis â€“ cellÂ â€˜drinkingâ€™)
-   Pinocytosis allows materials to be ingested en masse and hence takes
    less time than shuttling via membrane proteins

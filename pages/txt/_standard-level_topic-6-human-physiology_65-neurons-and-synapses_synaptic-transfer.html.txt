Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synapses are junctions between neurons and between neurons and
receptor or effector cells

Â  Â Â 
Nerves transmit electrical impulses by changing the ionic distribution
across the neuronal membrane (membrane potential)

-   Therefore, electrical signals are not able to be conducted when a
    semi-permeable membrane is absent

Synapses are the physical gaps that separate neurons from other cells
(otherÂ neurons and receptor or effector cells)

-   Neurons transmit information across synapses by converting the
    electrical signal into a chemical signal

Chemical Transfer Across Synapses

-   When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the
    opening of voltage-gated calcium channels
-   Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) diffuse into the cell and promote the fusion of
    vesicles (containing neurotransmitter) with the cell membrane
-   The neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal by
    exocytosis and cross the synaptic cleft
-   Neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the post-synaptic
    membrane and open ligand-gated ion channels
-   The opening of ion channels generates an electrical impulse in the
    post-synapticÂ neuron, propagating the pre-synaptic signal
-   The neurotransmitters released into the synapse are either recycled
    (by reuptake pumps) or degraded (by enzymatic activity)

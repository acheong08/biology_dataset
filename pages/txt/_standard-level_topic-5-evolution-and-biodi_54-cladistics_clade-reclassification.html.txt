Application:

â€¢ Â Reclassification of the figwort family using evidence from
cladistics

Â  Â Â 
Until recently, figworts were the 8^(th) largest family of flowering
plants (angiosperms), containing 275 different genera

-   This was problematic as many of the figwort plants were too
    dissimilar in structure to function as a meaningful grouping

Taxonomists examined the chloroplast gene in figworts and decided to
split the figwort species into five different clades

-   Now less than half of the species remain in the figwort family â€“
    which is now the 36^(th) largest among angiosperms

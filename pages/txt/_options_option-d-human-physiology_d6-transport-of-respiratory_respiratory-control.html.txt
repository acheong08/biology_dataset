Understanding:

â€¢ Â The rate of ventilation is controlled by the respiratory control
centre in the medulla oblongata

â€¢ Â During exercise the rate of ventilation changes in response to the
amount of CO₂ in the blood

Â  Â Â 
The respiratory control centre in the medulla oblongata responds to
stimuli from chemoreceptors in order to control ventilation

-   Central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata detect changes in
    CO₂ levels (as changes in pH of cerebrospinal fluid)
-   Peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies also
    detect CO₂ levels, as well as O₂ levels and blood pH

During exercise metabolism is increased, which results in a build up of
carbon dioxide and a reduction in the supply of oxygen

-   These changes are detected by chemoreceptors and impulses are sent
    to the respiratory control centre in the brainstem
-   Signals are sent to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to
    increase the rate of ventilation (this process is involuntary)
-   As the ventilation rate increases, CO₂ levels in the blood will
    drop, restoring blood pH (also O₂ levels will rise)
-   Long term effects of continual exercise may include an improved
    vital capacityÂ

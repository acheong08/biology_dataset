Understandings:

â€¢ Â Gametes are haploid so contain only one allele of each gene

â€¢ Â The two alleles of each gene separate into different haploid
nuclei during meiosis

Â  Â Â 
Gametes are haploid sex cells formed by the process of meiosis â€“ males
produce sperm and females produce ova

-   During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated into
    different nuclei prior to cell division
-   As homologous chromosomes carry the same genes, segregation of the
    chromosomes also separates the allele pairs
-   Consequently, as gametes contain only one copy of each chromosome
    they therefore carry only one allele of each geneÂ

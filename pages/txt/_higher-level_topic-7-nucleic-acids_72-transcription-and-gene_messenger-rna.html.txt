Understanding:

â€¢ Â Eukaryotic cells modify mRNA after transcription

Â  Â Â 
In eukaryotes, there are three post-transcriptional events that must
occur in order to form mature messenger RNA:

Capping

-   Capping involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5â€™-end of
    the transcribed RNA
-   The methylated cap provides protection against degradation
    byÂ exonucleases
-   It also allows the transcript to be recognised by the cellâ€™s
    translational machinery (e.g. nuclear export proteins and ribosome)

Polyadenylation

-   Polyadenylation describes the addition of a long chain of adenine
    nucleotidesÂ (a poly-A tail)Â to the 3â€™-end of the transcript
-   The poly-A tail improves the stability of the RNA transcript and
    facilitates its export from the nucleus

Splicing

-   Within eukaryotic genes are non-coding sequences called introns,
    which must be removed prior to forming mature mRNA
-   The coding regions are calledÂ exons and these are fused together
    when introns are removed to form a continuous sequence
-   Introns are intruding sequences whereas exons are expressing
    sequences
-   The process by which introns are removed is called splicing

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Splicing of mRNA increases the number of different proteins an
organism can produce

Â  Â Â 
Splicing can also result in the removal ofÂ exons â€“ a process known as
alternative splicing

The selective removal of specificÂ exons will result in the formation of
different polypeptides from a single gene sequence

-   For example, a particular protein may be membrane-bound or cytosolic
    depending on the presence of an anchoring motif

Epistasis

Epistasis describes a condition whereby one gene controls the expression
of another gene
In mice, the expression of a specific fur colour by one gene is
dependent upon the production of hair pigment by another gene

-   Black fur (B) is dominant to brown fur (b), but in the absence of
    hair pigment (cc) mice will appear albino

In humans, the gene for baldness supersedes genes for hair colour and
hence is epistatic in nature

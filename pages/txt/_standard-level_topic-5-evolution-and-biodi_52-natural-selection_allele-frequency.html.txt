Understanding:

â€¢ Â Individuals that are better adapted tend to survive and produce
more offspring while the less well adapted tend

Â  Â  to die or produce fewer offspring

Â  Â Â 
The variation that exists within a population is heritable (i.e.
genetic) and determined by the presence of alleles

-   These alleles may be passed from parent to offspring via sexual
    reproduction

Alleles encode for the phenotypic polymorphisms of a particular trait
and may be beneficial, detrimental or neutral:

-   Beneficial alleles will better equip the organism to survive and
    hence produce more offspring (encodes beneficial adaptations)
-   Detrimental alleles will harm the survival prospects of an organism,
    leading to fewer viable offspring
-   Neutral alleles will not affect the organisms survival prospects

Due to natural selection, the proportion of different alleles will
change across generations (evolution)

-   As beneficial alleles improve reproductive prospects (more
    offspring), they are more likely to be passed on to future
    generations
-   Conversely, detrimental alleles result in fewer offspring and hence
    are less likely to be present in future generations

If environmental conditions change, what constitutes a beneficial or
detrimental trait may change, and thus the allele frequencies in a
population are constantly evolving

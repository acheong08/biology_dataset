Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of a transect to correlate the distribution of plant or animal
species with an abiotic variable

Â  Â Â 
Quadrats and transects can measure the distribution of a plant or animal
species in response to an incremental abiotic factor

-   Quadrats are rectangular frames of known dimensions that can be used
    to establish population densities
-   Transects are a straight line along an abiotic gradient from which
    population data can be recorded to determine a pattern

Quadrats can be placed at regular intervals along the transect line in
order to generate population data

-   The quadrats will show the changing distribution pattern of a
    species in response to a change in an abiotic variable
-   This data can be used to identify optimal conditions as well as
    zones of stress and zones of intolerance

Transect Data

Transects are used to assess species distribution in correlation with
any abiotic factor that varies across a measurable distance

-   These factors could include elevation, elemental exposure,
    temperature, light levels, pH, humidity and more

A kite graph can be used to represent changes in species distribution in
a clear and effective fashion

-   The relative width of eachÂ â€˜kiteâ€™ represents the abundance of
    an organism at a particular point along a transect

In the example below, animal and plant distribution patterns are
determined along a typical rocky shore

-   Organisms experience varying levels of environmental exposure at
    high tide regions and low tide regions

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nervous and hormonal mechanisms control the secretion of digestive
juices

â€¢ Â The volume and content of gastric secretions are controlled by
nervous and hormonal mechanisms

Â  Â Â 
The secretion of digestive juices is controlled by both nervous and
hormonal mechanisms

-   These mechanisms control both the volume of secretions produced and
    the specific content (e.g. enzymes, acids, etc.)

Nervous Mechanism:

-   The sight and smell of food triggers an immediateÂ response by which
    gastric juice is secreted by the stomach pre-ingestion
-   When food enters the stomach it causes distension, which is detected
    by stretch receptors in the stomach lining
-   Signals are sent to the brain, which triggers the release of
    digestive hormones to achieve sustained gastric stimulation

Hormonal Mechanism:

-   Gastrin is secreted into the bloodstream from the gastric pits of
    the stomach and stimulates the release of stomach acids
-   If stomach pH drops too low (becomes too acidic), gastrin secretion
    is inhibited by gut hormones (secretin and somatostatin)
-   When digested food (chyme) passes into the small intestine, the
    duodenum also releases digestive hormones:
    -   Secretin andÂ cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulate the pancreas and
        liver to release digestive juices
    -   Pancreatic juices contain bicarbonate ions which neutralise
        stomach acids, while the liver produces bile to emulsify fats

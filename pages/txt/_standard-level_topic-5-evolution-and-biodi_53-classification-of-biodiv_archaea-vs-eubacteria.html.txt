Archaea vs Eubacteria

Traditional classification schemes separated organisms into two main
groups â€“ prokaryotes and eukaryotes

-   This classification scheme was widely entrenched until 1977 when
    Carl Woese proposed a new system

The large diversity of organisms classified as prokaryotes prompted
Woese to separate these bacteria into two distinct domains

-   Eubacteria includes most of the commonly encountered bacterial forms
    (i.e. pathogenic bacteria and probiotic bacteria)
-   Archaea consists of the extremophiles (e.g. thermophiles,
    halophiles, methanogens, etc.)

The archaeal cells were found to possess certain features that were more
in common with eukaryotic cells than eubacteria

-   This included certain structural features (e.g. cell wall
    composition) and the presence of histone-like proteins in DNA
-   Based on these discoveries it was concluded that eukaryotes and
    archaea share more recent common ancestry than eubacteria

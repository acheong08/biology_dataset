Understanding:

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is carried in solution and bound to haemoglobin in
the blood

â€¢ Â Carbon dioxide is transformed in red blood cells into hydrogen
carbonate ions

Â  Â Â 
Carbon dioxide is transported between the lungs and the tissues by one
of three mechanisms:

-   Some is bound to haemoglobin to form HbCO₂ (carbon dioxide binds to
    the globin and so doesnâ€™t compete with O₂ binding)
-   A very small fraction gets dissolved in water and is carried in
    solution (~5% â€“ carbon dioxide dissolves poorly in water)
-   The majority (~75%) diffuses into the erythrocyte and gets converted
    into carbonic acid

Transport as Carbonic Acid

-   When CO₂ enters the erythrocyte, it combines with water to form
    carbonic acid (reaction catalysed by carbonic anhydrase)
-   The carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) then dissociates to form hydrogen ions
    (H⁺) and bicarbonate (HCO₃^(â€“))
-   Bicarbonate is pumped out of the cell in exchange with chloride ions
    (exchange ensures the erythrocyte remains uncharged)
-   The bicarbonate in the blood plasma combines with sodium to form
    sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), which travels to the lungs
-   The hydrogen ions within the erythrocyte make the environment less
    alkaline, causing haemoglobin to release its oxygen
-   The haemoglobin absorbs the H⁺ ions and acts as a buffer to maintain
    the intracellular pH
-   When the red blood cell reaches the lungs, bicarbonate is pumped
    back into the cell and the entire process is reversed

11.1 Â Antibody Production and Vaccination

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Immunity is based on recognition of self
and destruction of foreign materials

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Every organism has unique molecules on the surface of its cells
-   Pathogens can be species-specific although others can cross species
    barriers
-   B lymphocytes are activated by T lymphocytes in mammals
-   Activated B cells multiply to form clones of plasma cells and memory
    cells
-   Plasma cells secrete antibodies
-   Antibodies aid the destruction of pathogens
-   White blood cells release histamine in response to allergens
-   Histamine causes allergic symptoms
-   Immunity depends on the persistance of memory cells
-   Vaccines contain antigens that trigger immunity but do not cause the
    disease
-   Fusion of a tumor cell with an antibody-producing cell creates a
    hybridoma cell
-   Monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybridoma cells

Applications:

-   Smallpox was the first infectious disease of humans to have been
    eradicated by vaccination
-   Monoclonal antibodies to hCG are used in pregnancy test kits
-   Antigens on the surface of red blood cells stimulate antibody
    production in a person with a different blood group

Skills:

-   Analysis of epidemiological data related to vaccination programmes

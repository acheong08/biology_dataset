Water Cycle

The water (hydrologic) cycle describes the continuous movement of water
on, above and below the surface of the Earth

This movement of water involves several different processes, including:

-   EvaporationÂ â€“ Water is converted to vapour by the sun and
    transferred from the Earthâ€™s surface to the atmosphere
-   TranspirationÂ â€“ Water vapour is released by plants and soil into
    the atmosphere
-   CondensationÂ â€“ Water vapour is transformed into liquid water
    droplets in the air (creating clouds and fog)
-   PrecipitationÂ â€“ Water vapour in the atmosphere condenses into
    liquid (rain) or solid (snow) and returns to the Earth
-   InfiltrationÂ â€“ The flow of water from the ground surface into the
    soil
-   RunoffÂ â€“ The variety of ways water moves along the ground
-   Subsurface FlowÂ â€“ The flow of water underground (will eventually
    drain into oceans or return to the surface via springs)

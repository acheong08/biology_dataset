Skill:

â€¢ Â Assess the nutrient content of a soil sample

Â  Â Â 
The bulk of soil is made up of a mixture of organic matter, rock and
mineral particles

-   The relative proportion of all these components, along with pH,
    determines soil type (e.g. sand, clay, loam, silt, etc.)

Soil testing kits can be used to identify the amounts of the different
components of soil, including:

-   Nutrients â€“ chemical reagents produce colour changes when testing
    for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or potassium (K)
-   Soil pH â€“ colour changes can be used to identify the acidity or
    alkalinity of a soil sample
-   Texture â€“ soil can be separated into layers according to particle
    size (different particles retain nutrients with varying efficacy
-   Water content â€“ electrical meters can determine water quantities
    based on the soilâ€™s capacity to transmit an electrical current

Gardeners and farmers require this information in order to determine the
viability of the soil for planting purposes

-   Identified issues may require adjustments to the types of crops
    planted or types of fertilisers employed

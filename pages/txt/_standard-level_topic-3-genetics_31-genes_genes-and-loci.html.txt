Understanding:

â€¢ Â A gene is a heritable factor that consists of a length of DNA and
influences a specific trait

â€¢ Â A gene occupies a specific position on a chromosome

Â  Â Â 
DNA is the genetic blueprint which codes for, and determines, the
characteristics of an organism

-   This includes the physical, behavioural and physiological features
    of the organism

DNA is packaged and organised into discrete structures called
chromosomesÂ 

-   A gene is a sequence of DNA that encodes for a specific trait
    (traits may also be influenced by multiple genes)
-   The position of a gene on a particular chromosome is called the
    locus (plural = loci)

10.2 Â Inheritance

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Genes may be linked or unlinked Â 
and are inherited accordingly

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Gene loci are said to be linked if on the same chromosome
-   Unlinked genes segregate independently as a result of meiosis
-   Variation can be discrete or continuous
-   The phenotypes of polygenic characteristics tend to show continuous
    variation
-   Chi-squared tests are used to determine whether the difference
    between an observed and expected frequency distribution is
    statistically significant

Applications:

-   Morganâ€™s discovery of non-Mendelian ratios in Drosophila
-   Completion and analysis of Punnett squares for dihybrid traits
-   Polygenic traits such as human height may also be influenced by
    environmental factors

Skills:

-   Calculation of the predicted genotypic and phenotypic ratio of
    offspring of dihybrid crosses involving unlinked autosomal genes
-   Identification of recombinants in crosses involving two linked genes
-   Use of a chi-squared test on data from dihybrid crosses

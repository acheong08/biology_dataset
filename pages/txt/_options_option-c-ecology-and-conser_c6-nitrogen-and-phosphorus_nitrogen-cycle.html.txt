Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing and labelling a diagram of the nitrogen cycle

Â  Â Â 
The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle whereby nitrogen is
converted into various chemical forms

-   Whilst ~78% of the atmosphere is composed of nitrogen (N₂), this gas
    is inert and unable to be used by plants and animals
-   Chemoautrophic bacteria can convert this nitrogen gas into compounds
    that can be assimilated by plants and animals

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia

â€¢ Â Rhizobium associates with roots in a mutualistic relationship

Â  Â Â 
Nitrogen Fixation

The first stage of the nitrogen cycle is the conversion of inert
nitrogen gas (N₂) intoÂ ammonia (NH₃)

-   This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme nitrogenase, which is
    produced by nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil
-   Azotobacter is found living freely in the soil, while Rhizobium
    forms a mutualistic association with the roots of legumes
-   Rhizobium forms nodules within the plant roots and supplies ammonia
    to the plant in exchange for carbohydrates
-   Ammonia (NH₃) becomes ammonium (NH₄⁺) when mixed with water, and
    this can be used by plants

Ammonification

Ammonia can also be produced from organic sources of nitrogen (e.g.
amino acids) when broken down by decomposers

-   As a plant or animal decays, saprotrophs will decompose organic
    materials to produce ammonia (and ammonium ions)
-   This process is known as ammonification and releases ammonium ions
    into the soil which can be absorbed by plantsÂ 

[ammonification]

Nitrification

Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium ions intoÂ nitrites
(NO₂^(â€“))Â andÂ nitrates (NO₃^(â€“))Â by nitrifying bacteria in the
soil

-   Nitrosomonas converts ammonium ions into nitrites, while Nitrobacter
    can convert the nitrites into nitrates
-   These reactions require oxygen and hence soil must be well aerated
    to ensure a rich supply of nitrites and nitrates
-   Nitrites and nitrates are easier for plants to assimilate and hence
    function as a predominant source of nitrogen for plants

Understanding:

â€¢ Â In the absence of oxygen denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate in
the soil

Â  Â Â 
Denitrification

Denitrification is a chemical reduction process that converts nitrates
(NO₃^(â€“)) into nitrogen gas (N₂)

-   It is carried out by denitrifying bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas
    denitrificans) in the absence of oxygen (i.e. anoxic conditions)
-   Nitrates can be used instead of oxygen as an electron acceptor
    during cellular respiration, producing nitrogen gas
-   This will only occur in oxygen-poor conditions (such as waterlogged
    soils) and reduces the availability of nitrates to plants

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Gene modification is carried out by gene transfer between species

Â  Â Â 
A gene determines a particular trait by encoding for a specific
polypeptide in a given organism

Because the genetic code is (almost) universal, an organism can
potentially express a new trait if the appropriate gene is introduced
into its genome

The transfer of genes between species is called gene modification, and
the new organism created is called a transgenic

Application:

â€¢ Â Gene transfer to bacteria using plasmids makes use of restriction
endonucleases and DNA ligase

Â  Â Â 
The process of gene transfer can be summarised in four key steps:

1.  Isolation of gene and vector (by PCR)
2.  Digestion of gene and vector (by restrictionÂ endonuclease)
3.  Ligation of gene and vector (by DNA ligase)
4.  Selection and expression of transgenic construct

Step 1: Â Isolating gene and vector

-   DNA can be isolated from cells by centrifugation â€“ whereby heavier
    components such as nuclei are separated
-   The gene of interest can then be specifically amplified via the
    polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
-   Gene sequences can also be generated from mRNA using reverse
    transcriptase â€“ these DNA sequences (cDNA) lack introns
-   A vector is a DNA molecule that is used as a vehicle to carry the
    gene of interest into a foreign cell
-   Bacterial plasmids are commonly used as vectors because they are
    capable of autonomous self-replication and expression
-   These plasmids may be modified for further functionality (e.g.
    selection markers, reporter genes, inducible expression promoters)Â 
-   Other types of vectors include modified viruses and artificial
    chromosomes

Step 2: Â Digestion with Restriction Enzymes

-   In order to incorporate a gene of interest into a vector, both must
    be cut with restrictionÂ enzymes at specific recognition sites
-   Restriction enzymes cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone to generate
    blunt ends or sticky ends (complementary overhangs)
-   Scientists will often cleave the vector and gene with two
    differentÂ â€˜sticky endâ€™Â restriction endonucleases (double
    digestion) to ensure the gene is inserted in the correct orientation
    and to prevent the vector from re-annealing without the desired
    insert

Step 3: Â Ligation of Vector and Insert

-   The gene of interest is inserted into a plasmid vector that has been
    cut with the same restrictionÂ endonucleases
-   This occurs because the sticky ends of the gene and vector overlap
    via complementary base pairing
-   The gene and vector are then spliced together by the enzyme DNA
    ligase to form a recombinant construct
-   DNA ligase joins the vector and gene by fusing their sugar-phosphate
    backbones together with a covalent phosphodiester bond

Formation of a Recombinant Construct

[DNA Ligation]

Step 4: Â Selection and Expression

-   The recombinant construct (including the gene of interest) is
    finally introduced into an appropriate host cell or organism
-   This process can be achieved in a variety of ways and is called
    transfection (for eukaryotes) or transformation (for prokaryotes)
-   Antibiotic selection is commonly used in order to identify which
    cells have successfully incorporated the recombinant construct
-   The plasmid vector contains an antibiotic resistance gene, so only
    transgenic cells will grow in the presence of antibiotic
-   Transgenic cells, once isolated and purified, will hopefully begin
    expressing the desired trait encoded by the gene of interest

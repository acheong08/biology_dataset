Application:

â€¢ Â External and internal intercostal muscles, and diaphragm and
abdominal muscles as examples of antagonistic

Â  Â Â muscle action

Â  Â Â 
Inspiration (inhaling) and expiration (exhaling) are controlled by two
sets of antagonistic muscle groups

-   Antagonistic means working oppositely â€“ when the inspiratory
    muscles contract, the expiratory musclesÂ relax (and vice versa)

Inspiration

The muscles responsible for inspiration are the diaphragm and external
intercostals (plus some accessory muscles)

-   Diaphragm muscles contract, causing the diaphragm to flatten and
    increase the volume of the thoracic cavity
-   External intercostals contract, pulling ribs upwards and outwards
    (expanding chest)
-   Additional muscle groups may help pull the ribs up and out (e.g.
    sternocleidomastoid and pectoralis minor)Â 

Expiration

The muscles responsible for expiration are the abdominal muscles and
internal intercostals (plus some accessory muscles)

-   Diaphragm muscles relax, causing the diaphragm to curve upwards and
    reduce the volume of the thoracic cavity
-   Internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs inwards and
    downwards (reducing breadth of chest)
-   Abdominal muscles contract and push the diaphragm upwards during
    forced exhalation
-   Additional muscle groups may help pull the ribs downwards (e.g.
    quadratas lumborum)

Attention BioNinjas: New Year = New Update

Learning Modules have been added to Additional Resources:Â 

-   Interactive presentations for all SL and AHL topics
-   Downloadable slideshows (with optional narrations)
-   Topic-specific activity sheets (with answers)
-   Summary notes for every core topic

Otherwise:

Welcome to the BioNinja Website â€“ your one-stop resource for
everything IB Biology related!

-   This website is designed specifically for the new IB Biology
    syllabus (2016 â€“)
-   This site is still under development, so new features will be
    periodically added
-   This site was optimised for Safari â€“ certain features may not work
    on other browsers

it!

will depend on demand):

-   All of the options and a PSOW guide

Why the change?

While the new IB syllabus covers much the same content as the old
syllabus, the style has changed significantly:

-   The old syllabus was organised into dot points, each of which
    included a specific command term that identified the level of
    knowledge required
-   The new syllabus is organised into assessment statements that do not
    include command terms â€“ this makes the knowledge requirements
    broader and vague

To reflect this change, the new website no longer addresses content as
an itemised list, however every assessment statement is still
specifically covered

-   For each sub-topic, assessment statements are grouped and organised
    by subject matter and explained as part of the core content
-   Additional information that helps with understanding but is not
    specifically referenced by an assessment statement is included as
    extra content

The new layout is not as concise as the old layout, but this is because
the new syllabus is not as concise as the old syllabus

-   The new layout is a lot prettier than the old layout though â€“ hope
    you like it!

Want to be heard?

I am keen to receive (constructive) feedback and have set up a dedicated
email account to hear your thoughts: Â bioninjaib@hotmail.com

-   Is there a problem with the site? Â (i.e. broken links, etc.)
-   Donâ€™t like the new format and have a better idea? Â (no such thing
    as a bad idea)
-   What feature would you like to be added next? Â (features will be
    added in order of demand)
-   Any ideas for further improvement? Â (are there areas where
    more/less information is required?)
-   Just want to tell me how great I am? Â (I donâ€™t mindâ€¦ seriously!
    ;P)

Just remember: This is still a work in progress, so be constructive and
considerate with any feedback (bioninjas hate trolls)

Donâ€™t be a Troll!

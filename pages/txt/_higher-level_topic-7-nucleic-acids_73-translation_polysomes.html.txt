Understanding:

â€¢ Â Translation can occur immediately after transcription in
prokaryotes due to the absence of aÂ nuclear membrane

Â  Â Â 
In eukaryotes, the ribosomes are separated from the genetic material
(DNA and RNA) by the nucleus

-   After transcription, the mRNA must be transported from the nucleus
    (via nuclear pores) prior to translation by the ribosome
-   This transport requires modification to the RNA construct (e.g.
    5â€™-methyl capping and 3â€™-polyadenylation)

Prokaryotes lack compartmentalised structures (like the nucleus) and so
transcription and translation need not be separated

-   Ribosomes may begin translating the mRNA molecule while it is still
    being transcribed from the DNA template
-   This is possible because both transcription and translation occur in
    a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â directionÂ

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of polysomes in electron micrographs of prokaryotes
and eukaryotes

Â  Â Â 
A polysome (or a polyribosome) is a group of two or more ribosomes
translating an mRNA sequence simultaneously

-   The polysomes will appear as beads on a string (each 'bead'
    represents a ribosome ; theÂ â€˜stringâ€™Â is the mRNA strand)
-   In prokaryotes, the polysomes may form while the mRNA is still being
    transcribed from the DNA template
-   Ribosomes located at the 3â€™-end of the polysome cluster will have
    longer polypeptide chains that those at the 5â€™-end

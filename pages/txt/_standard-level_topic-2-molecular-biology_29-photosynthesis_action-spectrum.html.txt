Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing an absorption spectrum for chlorophyll and an action
spectrum for photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 
Pigments absorb light as a source of energy for photosynthesis

-   The absorption spectrum indicates the wavelengths of light absorbed
    by each pigment (e.g. chlorophyll)
-   The action spectrum indicates the overall rate of photosynthesis at
    each wavelength of light

There is a strong correlation between the cumulative absorption spectra
of all pigments and the action spectrum

-   Both display two main peaks â€“ a larger peak at the blue region
    (~450 nm) and a smaller peak at the red region (~670 nm)Â 
-   Both display a trough in the green / yellow portion of the visible
    spectra (~550 nm)

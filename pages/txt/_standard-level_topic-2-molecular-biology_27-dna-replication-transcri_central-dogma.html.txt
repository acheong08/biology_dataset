Central Dogma

The central dogma of molecular biology explains the flow of genetic
information within a cell

-   DNA codes for RNA via the process of transcription (occurs within
    the nucleus)
-   RNA codes for protein via the process of translation (occurs at the
    ribosomes)

This information flow was always considered to be uni-directional:
Â DNAÂ â†’ RNAÂ â†’ Protein
However in 1970 it was discovered that retroviruses could copy DNA from
an RNA sequence

-   These viruses possess an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that allows
    for reverse transcription to occur
-   Reverse transcription is now commonly used in scientific studies to
    establish gene expression profiles

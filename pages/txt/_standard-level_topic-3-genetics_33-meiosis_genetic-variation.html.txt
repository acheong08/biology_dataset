Understandings:

â€¢ Â Crossing over and random orientation promotes genetic variation

â€¢ Â Fusion of gametes from different parents promotes genetic
variation

Â  Â Â 
The advantage of meiotic division and sexual reproduction is that it
promotes genetic variation in offspring

The three main sources of genetic variation arising from sexual
reproduction are:

-   Crossing over (in prophase I)
-   Random assortment of chromosomes (in metaphase I)
-   Random fusion of gametes from different parentsÂ 

Crossing Over

Crossing over involves the exchange of segments of DNA between
homologous chromosomes during prophase I

-   The exchange of genetic material occurs between non-sister
    chromatids at points called chiasmata

As a consequence of this recombination, all four chromatids that
comprise the bivalent will be genetically different

-   Chromatids that consist of a combination of DNA derived from both
    homologous chromosomes are called recombinants
-   Offspring with recombinant chromosomes will have unique gene
    combinations that are not present in either parentÂ 

[crossover]

Random Orientation

When homologous chromosomes line up in metaphase I, their orientation
towards the opposing poles is random

The orientation of each bivalent occurs independently, meaning different
combinations of maternal / paternal chromosomes can be inherited when
bivalents separate in anaphase I

-   The total number of combinations that can occur in gametes is 2^(n)
    â€“ where n = haploid number of chromosomes
-   Humans have 46 chromosomes (n = 23) and thus can produce 8,388,608
    different gametes (2²³) by random orientationÂ 
-   If crossing over also occurs, the number of different gamete
    combinations becomesÂ immeasurable

Random Fertilisation

The fusion of two haploid gametes results in the formation of a diploid
zygote

-   This zygote can then divide by mitosis and differentiate to form a
    developing embryo

As meiosis results in genetically distinct gametes, random fertilisation
by egg and sperm will always generate different zygotes

-   Identical twins are formed after fertilisation, by the complete
    fission of the zygote into two separate cell masses

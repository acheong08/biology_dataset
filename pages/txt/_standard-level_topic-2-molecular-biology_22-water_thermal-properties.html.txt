Understanding:

â€¢ Â Hydrogen bonding and dipolarity explain the cohesive, adhesive,
thermal and solvent properties of water

Â  Â Â 
Water has the capacity to absorb significant amounts of heat before
changing state

-   This is due to the extensive hydrogen bonding between water
    molecules â€“ the H-bonds need to be broken before a change in state
    can occur and this requires the absorption of energy (heat)

Consequently, water is an excellent medium for living organisms as it is
relatively slow to change temperature and thus supports the maintenance
of constant conditions (internal and external)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Comparison of the thermal properties of water with those of
methane

Â  Â Â 
Methane (CH₄) provides a good basis for comparison with water due to the
many similarities between their structures:

-   Comparable size and weight (H₂O = 18 dalton ; CH₄ = 16 dalton)
-   Comparable valence structures (both have tetrahedralÂ orbital
    formations, but water is bent due to unbonded electron pairs)Â

Differences between Water and Methane

The differences in thermal properties between water and methane arise
from differences in polarity between the molecules:

-   Water is polar and can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds (due to
    high electronegativity of oxygen atom)
-   Methane is non-polar and can only form weak dispersion forces
    between its molecules (carbon has a lower electronegativity)

This means water absorbs more heat before changing state (each H-bond
has an average energy of 20 kJ/mol)

-   Water has a significantly higher melting and boiling point
-   Water has a higher specific heat capacity (energy required to raise
    the temperature of 1 g of substance by 1ÂºC)
-   Water has a higher heat of vaporisation (energy absorbed per gram as
    it changes from a liquid to a gas /Â vapour)
-   Water as a higher heat of fusion (energy required to be lost to
    change 1 g of liquid to 1 g of solid at 0ÂºC)

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of water as a coolant in sweat

Â  Â Â 
The evaporation of water as sweat is a fundamental mechanism employed by
humans as a means of cooling down

-   The change of water from liquid to vapour (evaporation) requires an
    input of energy
-   This energy comes from the surface of the skin when it is hot,
    therefore when the sweat evaporates the skin is cooled
-   Because water has a high specific heat capacity, it absorbs a lot of
    thermal energy before it evaporates
-   Thus water functions as a highly effective coolant, making it the
    principal component of sweat

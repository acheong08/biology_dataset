C6 Â Nitrogen and Phosphorus Cycles

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Soil cycles are subject to disruption

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia
-   Rhizobium associates with roots in a mutualistic relationship
-   In the absence of oxygen denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate in the
    soil
-   Phosphorus can be added to the phosphorus cycle by application of
    fertilizer or removed by the harvesting of agricultural crops
-   The rate of turnover in the phosphorus cycle is much lower than the
    nitrogen cycle
-   Availability of phosphate may become limiting to agriculture in the
    future
-   Leaching of mineral nutrients from agricultural land into rivers
    causes eutrophication and leads to increased biochemical oxygen
    demand

Applications:

-   The impact of waterlogging on the nitrogen cycle
-   Insectivorous plants as an adaptation for low nitrogen availability
    in waterlogged soils

Skills:

-   Drawing and labelling a diagram of the nitrogen cycle
-   Assess the nutrient content of a soil sample

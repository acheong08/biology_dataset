â€¢ Â Annotation of diagrams of seminiferous tubule and ovary to show
the stages of gametogenesis

Â  Â Â 
The process of gametogenesis occurs in the reproductive organs (gonads)
of the male and female

-   In males, the gametes are produced within the seminiferous tubules
    of the testes
-   In females, the gametes are produced by the ovaries

Seminiferous Tubule

-   The testes are composed of seminiferous tubules which produce sperm
-   Each tubule is surrounded by a basement membrane which is lined by
    germline epithelium
-   The germline epithelium will divide by mitosis to make spermatogonia
    (which divide by meiosis to make spermatids)
-   The spermatids differentiate into functional spermatozoa, which are
    then released into the lumen of the tubule
-   These developing spermatozoa are nourished by Sertoli cells, which
    reside in the tubule lining
-   Outside of the tubules are blood capillaries and interstitial cells
    (Leydig cells) which produce testosterone

Ovary

-   The ovary contains follicles in various stages of development
-   These follicles will develop over the course of a menstrual cycle
    and hence will not always be apparent upon inspection
-   Primordial follicles contain egg cells that have been arrested in
    prophase I (primary oocytes)
-   Some of these follicles will develop each month into primary
    follicles and then secondary follicles
-   Each cycle, one follicle will become a dominant Graafian follicle
    and rupture to release the secondary oocyte
-   The ruptured follicle will then develop into a short-lived
    corpusÂ luteum, which secretes key ovarian hormones
-   Eventually the corpus luteum will degenerate to form a corpus
    albicans

Cross-Sections of Reproductive Tissue

Spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules starts at the outer lining
of the tubule (germline epithelium)

-   As the germ cells divide by meiosis they move towards the inner
    lining before being released into the lumen as sperm
-   Non-dividing cells within the tubule lining will represent the
    Sertoli cells, which nourish and support the spermatocytes
-   Cells located externally to the tubule will likely represent
    interstitial cells (Leydig cells), which produce testosterone

Oogenesis in the ovaries is not a continuous process and proceeds
according to a monthly menstrual cycle

-   Consequently, certain developing follicles will only be visible at
    particular stages in the cycle
-   As a follicle matures it will grow larger in size, allowing for
    comparisons to be made between primary and secondary follicles
-   Unlike in spermatogenesis, the outer germline epithelium of the
    ovaries does not directly contribute to gamete formation

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Temperature, pH and substrate concentration affect the rate of
activity of enzymes

Â  Â Â 
Various factors may affect the activity of enzymes, by either affecting
the frequency of enzyme-substrate collisions or by affecting the
capacity for the enzyme and substrate to interact (e.g. denaturation)

-   Temperature, pH and substrate concentration will all influence the
    rate of activity of an enzyme

Temperature

-   Low temperatures result in insufficient thermal energy for the
    activation of an enzyme-catalysed reaction to proceed
-   Increasing the temperature will increase the speed and motion of
    both enzyme and substrate, resulting in higher enzyme activity
-   This is because a higher kinetic energy will result in more frequent
    collisions between the enzymes and substrates
-   At an optimal temperature (may vary for different enzymes), the rate
    of enzyme activity will be at its peak
-   Higher temperatures will cause enzyme stability to decrease, as the
    thermal energy disrupts the enzymeâ€™sÂ hydrogen bonds
-   This causes the enzyme (particularly the active site) to lose its
    shape, resulting in the loss of activity (denaturation)

pH

-   Changing the pH will alter the charge of the enzyme, which in turn
    will alter protein solubility and overall shape
-   Changing the shape or charge of the active site will diminish its
    ability to bind the substrate, abrogating enzyme function
-   Enzymes have an optimal pH (may differ between enzymes) and moving
    outside this range diminishes enzyme activity

Substrate Concentration

-   Increasing substrate concentration will increase the activity of a
    corresponding enzyme
-   More substrates mean there is an increased chance of enzyme and
    substrate colliding and reacting within a given period
-   After a certain point, the rate of activity will cease to rise
    regardless of any further increases in substrate levels
-   This is because the environment is saturated with substrate and all
    enzymes are bound and reacting (V_(max))

Plant Hormones

Plant growth and development are controlled by plant hormones
(phytohormones)

-   There are 5 main plant hormones that coordinate plant growth and
    development

Auxins:

-   Promote primary growth (lengthening) by promoting cell elongation
    and increasing the rate of cell division
-   Promote apical dominance â€“ whereby the apex / tip of a plant grows
    while the lateral buds remain undeveloped
-   Auxin concentrations may change in response to directional stimuli
    (i.e. play a key role in tropisms)

Cytokinins:

-   Promote cell division (cytokinesis) and ensure roots and shoots grow
    at equal rates
-   Promotes secondary growth (thickening) and help to control the rate
    of branching by a plant
-   Cytokinins are also involved in stimulating the growth of fruit

Gibberellins:

-   Triggers germination in dormant seeds (initiates plant growth)
-   Gibberellin also causes stem elongation by promoting cell elongation
    and cell division

Ethylene:

-   A gas which acts as a plant hormone and stimulates maturation and
    ageing (senescence)
-   It is responsible for the ripening of certain fruit (auxins and
    gibberellins promote fruit growth but inhibit ripening)
-   It also contributes to the loss of leaves (abscission) and the death
    of flowers

Abscisic Acid:

-   Abscisic acid (ABA) principally functions to inhibit plant growth
    and development
-   It promotes the death of leaves (abscission) and is responsible for
    seed dormancy
-   It generally initiates stress responses in plants (like winter
    dormancy in deciduous plants)
-   Abscisic acid controls the closing of stomata and hence regulates
    water loss in plants

â€¢ Â Separation of photosynthetic pigments by chromatograph

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthetic organisms do not rely on a single pigment to absorb
light, but instead benefit from the combined action of many

-   These pigments include chlorophylls,Â xanthophyll and carotenes

Chromatography is an experimental technique by which mixtures can be
separated

-   A mixture is dissolved in a fluid (called the mobile phase) and
    passed through a static material (called the stationary phase)
-   The different components of the mixture travel at different speeds,
    causing them to separate
-   A retardation factor can then be calculated (Rf value = distance
    component travels Ã· distance solvent travels)

Two of the most common techniques for separating photosynthetic pigments
are:

-   Paper chromatography â€“ uses paper (cellulose) as the stationary
    bed
-   Thin layer chromatography â€“ uses a thin layer ofÂ adsorbent (e.g.
    silica gel) which runs faster and has better separation

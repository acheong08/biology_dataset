Understanding:

â€¢ Â The heart rate can be increased or decreased by impulses brought
to the heart through two nerves from theÂ 

Â  Â Â medulla of the brain

Â  Â Â 
While the basal heart rate is determined within the heart by the
pacemaker, it can be regulated by external signals

-   Nerve signals from the brain can trigger rapid changes, while
    endocrine signals can trigger more sustained changes
-   Changes to blood pressure levels or CO₂ concentrations (and thereby
    blood pH) will trigger changes in heart rate

Nerve Signalling

The pacemaker is under autonomic (involuntary) control from the brain,
specifically the medulla oblongata (brain stem)

Two nerves connected to the medulla regulate heart rate by either
speeding it up or slowing it down:

-   The sympathetic nerve releases the neurotransmitter noradrenaline
    (a.k.a. norepinephrine) to increase heart rate
-   The parasympathetic nerve (vagus nerve) releases the
    neurotransmitter acetylcholine to decrease heart rate

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Epinephrine increases the heart rate to prepare for vigorous
physical activity

Â  Â Â 
Hormonal Signalling

Hormones are chemical messengers released into the bloodstream that act
specifically on distant target sites (like the heart)

Heart rate can undergo a sustained increase in response to hormonal
signalling in order to prepare for vigorous physical activity

-   The hormone adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) is released from the
    adrenal glands (located above the kidneys)
-   Adrenaline increases heart rate by activating the same chemical
    pathways as the neurotransmitter noradrenaline

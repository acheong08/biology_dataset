5.1 Â Evidence for Evolution

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
There is overwhelming evidence
for the evolution of life on earth

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Evolution occurs when heritable characteristics of a species change
-   The fossil record provides evidence for evolution
-   Selective breeding of domesticated animals shows that artificial
    selection can cause evolution
-   Evolution of homologous structures by adaptive radiation explains
    similarities inÂ structure when there are differences in function
-   Populations of a species can gradually diverge into separate species
    by evolution
-   Continuous variation across the geographical range of related
    populations matches the concept of gradual divergence

Applications:

-   Development of melanistic insects in polluted areas
-   Comparison of the pentadactyl limb of mammals, birds, amphibians and
    reptiles with different methods of locomotion

6.5 Â Neurons and Synapses

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Neurons transmit the message,
synapses modulate the message

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Neurons transmit electrical impulses
-   The myelination of nerve fibres allows for saltatory conduction
-   Neurons pump sodium and potassium ions across their membranes to
    generate a resting potential
-   An action potential consists of depolarization and repolarization of
    theÂ neuron
-   Nerve impulses are action potentials propagated along the axons of
    neurons
-   Propagation of nerve impulses is the result of local currents that
    cause each successive part of the axon to reach the threshold
    potential
-   Synapses are junctions between neurons and between neurons and
    receptor or effector cells
-   When presynaptic neurons are depolarized they release a
    neurotransmitter into the synapse
-   A nerve impulse is only initiated if the threshold potential is
    reached

Applications:

-   Secretion and reabsorption of acetylcholine by neurons at synapses
-   Blocking of synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses in insects
    by binding of neonicotinoid pesticides to acetylcholine receptors

Skills:

-   Analysis of oscilloscope traces showing resting potentials and
    action potentials

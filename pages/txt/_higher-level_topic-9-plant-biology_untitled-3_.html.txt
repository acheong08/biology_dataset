9.4 Â Reproduction in Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Reproduction in flowering plants is influenced
by the biotic and abiotic environment

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Flowering involves a change in gene expression in the shoot apex
-   The switch to flowering is a response to the length of light and
    dark periods in many plants
-   Success in plant reproduction depends on pollination, fertilization
    and seed dispersal
-   Most flowering plants use mutualistic relationships with pollinators
    in sexual reproduction

Applications:

-   Methods used to induce short-day plants to flower out of season

Skill:

-   Drawing internal structure of seeds
-   Drawing of half-views of animal-pollinated flowers
-   Design of experiments to test hypotheses about factors affecting
    germination

Artificial Gene Transfer

The inheritance of particular characteristics results from the
transmission of associated genes from one generation to the next

-   As this transmission requires reproduction by the organism/s and
    occurs across generations it is called vertical gene transfer
-   Typically, the only way for most organisms to develop particular
    genetic traits is via inheriting them from their parents

Bacteria can transfer genes between organisms within a generation via
the exchange of plasmids by bacterial conjugation

-   This transmission is called horizontal gene transfer as it occurs
    within a single generation

Humans have adapted the process by extracting plasmids from bacteria and
using them as a vector to deliver genes of interest

-   This has allowed humans to transfer genes not only within
    generations, but between separate species
-   This form of evolutionary modification is a type of artificial
    selection as it occurs as a direct result of human intervention

Carbon Footprint

A carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse gases
produced to directly and indirectly support human activity

-   It is usually expressed in equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂)

A carbon footprint is therefore the sum of all CO₂ emissions that were
induced by a person's activity within a given timeframe:

-   All fossil fuelÂ consumption (including petrol, electricity, natural
    gas)
-   All transportation (besides human-powered activities like walking
    and cycling)
-   All emissions associated with consumables (e.g. the production of a
    cheesburger can result in ~ 3 kg of CO₂ emissions)

Efforts to reduce a carbon footprint of an individual, household or
company usually involves reducing, reusing and recycling

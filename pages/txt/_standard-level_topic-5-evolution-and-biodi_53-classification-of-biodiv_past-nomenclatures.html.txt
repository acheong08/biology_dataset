Past Nomenclatures

The binomial system of nomenclature was devised by Carolus Linnaeus in
1735 as a method for identifying organisms

-   This initial system grouped all organisms into two kingdoms â€“
    vegetable (plants) and animal

The binomial system of nomenclature is still used by scientists today,
however several revisions have occurred over the years:

-   In 1866, Ernst Haeckel proposed the addition of a third kingdom â€“
    Protista
-   In 1925, Edouard Chatton recognised the distinction between
    prokaryotes and eukaryotes and proposed a two empire system
-   In 1938, Herbert Copeland incorporated prokaryotic cells into a
    fourth kingdom â€“ Monera
-   In 1969, Robert Whittaker proposed a five kingdom system, which
    included a kingdom for Fungi
-   In 1977, Carl Woese identified differences in prokaryotes and in
    1990 proposed the currently recognised three domain system

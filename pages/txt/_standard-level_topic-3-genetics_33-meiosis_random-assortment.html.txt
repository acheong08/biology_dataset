Understanding:

â€¢ Â Orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes prior to separation
is random

Â  Â Â 
During metaphase I, homologous chromosomes line up at the equator as
bivalents in one of two arrangements:

-   Maternal copy left / paternal copy right Â OR Â paternal copy left /
    maternal copy right

This orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes is random, as is the
subsequent assortment of chromosomes into gametes

-   The final gametes will differ depending on whether they got the
    maternal or paternal copy of a chromosome following anaphase I

As this random assortment will occur for each homologous pair, the
number of possible gamete combinations are dependent on the number of
homologous pairs

-   Gamete combinations = 2^(n) (where n represents the haploid number)

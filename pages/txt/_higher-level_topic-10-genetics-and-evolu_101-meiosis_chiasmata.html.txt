Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chiasmata formation between non-sister chromatids can result in
the exchange of alleles

Â  Â Â 
Synapsis

During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes become connected in
a process known as synapsis

-   The connected homologues are known as a bivalent (bi = two
    chromosomes) or a tetrad (tetra = four chromatids)
-   The chromosomes are connected by a protein-RNA complex called the
    synaptonemal complex

While autosomes always undergo synapsis during meiosis, sex chromosomes
often remain unpaired

Pairing of Homologous Chromosomes via Synapsis

Chiasmata

While in synapsis, non-sister chromatids may break and recombine with
their homologous partner (crossing over)

These non-sister chromatids remain physically connected at these points
of exchange â€“ regions called chiasmata

Chiasmata (singular = chiasma) hold the homologous chromosomes together
as a bivalent until anaphase I

-   Chiasmata formation between non-sister chromatids can result in the
    exchange of alleles

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing diagrams to show chiasmata formed by crossing over

Â  Â Â 
Chiasmata are X-shaped points of attachment between two non-sister
chromatids of a homologous pair

Chiasmata form as a result of crossing over and hence non-sister
chromatids should show an exchange of genetic material

-   The exchange of genetic material is most easily shown if homologous
    chromosomes are differentially colour-coded

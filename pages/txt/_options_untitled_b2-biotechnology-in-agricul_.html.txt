B2 Â Biotechnology in Agriculture

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Crops can be modified to increase yields
and to obtain novel products

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Transgenic organisms produce proteins that were not previously part
    of their speciesâ€™ proteome
-   Genetic modification can be used to overcome environmental
    resistance to increase crop yields
-   Genetically modified crop plants can be used to produce novel
    products
-   Bioninformatics plays a role in identifying target genes
-   The target gene is linked to other sequences that control its
    expression
-   An open reading frame is a significant length of DNA from a start
    codon to a stop codon
-   Marker genes are used to indicate successful uptake
-   Recombinant DNA must be inserted into the plant cell and taken up by
    its chromosome or chloroplast DNA
-   Recombinant DNA can be introduced into whole plants, leaf discs or
    protoplasts
-   Recombinant DNA can be introduced by direct physical and chemical
    methods or indirectly by vectors

Applications:

-   Use of tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to
    introduce glyphosate resistance into soybean crops
-   Genetic modification of tobacco mosaic virus to allow bulk
    production of Hepatitis B vaccine in tobacco plants
-   Production of Amflora potato (SolanumÂ tuberosum) for paper and
    adhesive industries

Skills:

-   Evaluation of data on the environmental impact of
    glyphosate-tolerant soybeans
-   Identification of an open reading frame (ORF)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Multiple sequence alignment is used in the study ofÂ phylogenetics

Â  Â Â 
Phylogeny refers to an evolutionary line of descent and can be
determined by comparing sequences in different species

-   Variations in these sequences (either nucleotide or amino acid
    sequences) will occur due to mutations
-   The greater the differences between the sequences, the longer the
    time span since the two species had a common ancestor

Cladograms are tree diagrams where each branch point represents the
splitting of two new groups from a common ancestor

-   Each branch point (node) represents a speciation event by which
    distinct species are formed via divergent evolution
-   In cladograms, the length of each branch is the same â€“ the
    branches do not infer an evolutionary time scale

Phylograms are similar to cladograms, however branch lengths may differ
according to the length of time since speciation

-   Unlike cladograms, phylograms do infer the amount of evolutionary
    time separating two species

Phylogram construction requires comparison of sequences that have a
constant rate of mutation (â€˜evolutionary clocksâ€™)

-   Mitochondrial DNA is a useful source as it is maternally derived,
    has a known mutation rate and lacks recombinationÂ

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of software to construct simple cladograms and phylograms of
related organisms using DNA sequences

Â  Â Â 
Phylogeny trees can be constructed from DNA sequences by usingÂ two
online resources:

-   GenBankÂ â€“ a genetic database that serves as an annotated
    collection of DNA sequences
-   Clustal OmegaÂ â€“ an alignment program that compares multiple
    sequences of DNA

[genbank][clustal]

Constructing Phylogeny Trees

Step 1:Â Â Select a gene or protein common to a range of selected
organisms

-   Examples of molecules which are ubiquitously found in many animals
    include haemoglobin and cytochrome c

Step 2:Â Â Copy the molecular sequence (DNA or amino acid) for each of
the selected organisms

-   Use the GenBank database to identify relevant DNA or amino acid
    sequences
-   Sequences can be collated in a Word document and then saved as a
    document in plain text format (.txt)Â 
-   Before each sequence, designate a species name preceded by a forward
    arrow (e.g. '>Humanâ€™Â orÂ â€˜>Chimpanzeeâ€™)

Step 3:Â Â Run a multiple alignment and generate a phylogeny tree
(cladogram)

-   Use Clustal Omega align multiple DNA or amino acid sequences for
    comparison
-   Clustal Omega can generate branched phylograms after a sequence
    alignment is completed (selectÂ â€˜Phylogenetic Treeâ€™)

Example: Â Upload the following plain text files to compare nucleotide
and amino acid sequences from different species:

-   CHRNEÂ Â â€“ Â Cholinergic receptor epsilon (nicotinic) for various
    species (nucleotide sequence)
-   HBAÂ Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin alpha chain from various speciesÂ (amino
    acid sequence)

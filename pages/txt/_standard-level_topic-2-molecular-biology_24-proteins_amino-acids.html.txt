Understanding:

â€¢ Â There are 20 different amino acids in polypeptides synthesised on
ribosomes

Â  Â Â 
Proteins are comprised of long chains of recurring monomers called amino
acids

Amino acids all share a common basic structure, with a central carbon
atom bound to:

-   An amine group (NH₂)
-   A carboxylic acid group (COOH)
-   A hydrogen atom (H)
-   A variable side chain (R)

Structure of a Generalised Amino Acid

[amino acid]

There are 20 different amino acids which are universal to all living
organisms

-   A further two â€“Â selenocysteine and pyrrolysine â€“ are modified
    variants found only in certain organisms

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Amino acids can be linked together in any sequence giving a huge
range of possible polypeptides

Â  Â Â 
Amino acids are joined together on the ribosome to form long chains
called polypeptides, which make up proteins

Each type of amino acid differs in the composition of the variable side
chain

These side chains will have distinct chemical properties (e.g. charged,
non-polar, etc.) and hence cause the protein to fold and function
differently according to its specific position within the polypeptide
chain

As most natural polypeptide chains contain between 50 â€“ 2000 amino
acid residues, organisms are capable of producing a huge range of
possible polypeptides

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Transgenic organisms produce proteins that were not previously
part of their speciesâ€™ proteome

Â  Â Â 
Transgenic organisms are genetically modified to express characteristics
based on genes introduced from another source

-   The introduced genes code for novel proteins that were not
    previously part of the speciesâ€™ proteome

The process of genetically engineering a transgenic organism typically
involves three key stages:

-   The gene of interest must first be identified and isolated
-   The gene must be delivered into the cells of the appropriate host
    organism
-   The transgenic cells must be selected for according to successful
    gene expression

Producing Transgenic Crops

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Genetic modification can be used to overcome environmental
resistance to increase crop yields

â€¢ Â Genetically modified crop plants can be used to produce novel
products

Â  Â Â 
Genetic modification can be used in agriculture to overcome unfavourable
environmental factors and increase crop yield

-   Tolerance genes can be introduced into plants to provide resistance
    to herbicides
-   Genes from xerophytes or halophytes can be introduced into crops to
    allow them to grow in dry soil or saline conditions
-   Resistance to particular viral diseases or pathogenic infections can
    be introduced into crop plants

Crops can also be genetically modified to produce novel products that
may benefit the consumer

-   The introduction of genes may improve the nutritional value of the
    crop (e.g. Golden rice produces more beta-carotene)
-   Modified crops may produce toxins to pest species, obviating the
    need for insecticides (e.g. Bt corn is toxic to the corn borer)
-   Crops are being created that possess the antigenic fragments of
    specific pathogens, thus functioning as edible vaccines

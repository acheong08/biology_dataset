â€¢ Â Comparison of genome size of T2 phage, Escherichia coli,
Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens andÂ 

Â  Â Paris japonica

Genome size can vary greatly between organisms and is not a valid
indicator of genetic complexity

-   The largest known genome is possessed by the canopy plant Paris
    japonica â€“ 150 billion base pairs
-   The smallest known genome is possessed by the bacterium
    CarsonellaÂ ruddi â€“ 160,000 base pairs

As a general rule:

-   Viruses and bacteria tend to have very small genomes
-   Prokaryotes typically have smaller genomes than eukaryotes
-   Sizes of plant genomes can vary dramatically due to the capacity for
    plant species to self-fertilise and become polyploid

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Addiction can be affected by genetic predisposition, social
environment and dopamine secretion

Â  Â Â 
An addiction is a dependence on a substance or an activity which results
in its repeated and compulsive use

-   Stopping is very difficult and can cause severe mental and physical
    reactions (withdrawal symptoms)
-   Addictions can be affected by genetic factors, social factors and
    dopamine secretion

Genetic Predisposition

-   Particular addictions can run in families, suggesting a genetic
    predisposition (although social factors may contribute)
-   Specific genes might influence the rate of drug metabolism or
    intensity of drug effect (i.e. dopamine secretion)
-   Genetic factors may also contribute to personality types that are
    more inclined towards addictive behaviours
-   The genetic predisposition for a particular addiction may be
    determined by polygenic inheritance

Social Environment

-   Individuals raised in environments with prevalent substance abuse
    are at higher risk of addiction (peer pressure risks)
-   Individuals treated with neglect (child abuse) or suffering
    significant personal trauma are at a higher risk of addiction
-   Certain cultures have a higher incidence of addictions (may reflect
    demographic influences or marketing forces)
-   Low socioeconomic status (i.e. poverty) may increase the likelihood
    of addiction (poor education / lack of support networks)

Dopamine Secretion

-   Dopamine is a neurotransmitter released within the limbic system in
    response to reward (activates pleasure pathways)
-   Certain drugs (e.g. cocaine, heroin) and particular activities (e.g.
    sex, gambling) enhance dopamine activity
-   Long-term substance abuse will lead to the down-regulation of
    dopamine receptors, requiring higher doses to achieve effect
-   Consequently, addicts must continue to repeat the addictive activity
    in order to achieve a diminishing level of reward

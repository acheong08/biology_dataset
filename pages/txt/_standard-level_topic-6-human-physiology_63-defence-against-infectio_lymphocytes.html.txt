Understanding:

â€¢ Â Production of antibodies by lymphocytes in response to particular
pathogens gives specific immunity

Â  Â Â 
TheÂ third line of defenceÂ against infectious disease is the
adaptiveÂ immune system, which isÂ specificÂ in its response

-   It can differentiate between particular pathogens and target a
    response that is specific to a given pathogen
-   It can respond rapidly upon re-exposure to a specific pathogen,
    preventing symptoms from developing (immunological memory)

Lymphocytes

The adaptive immune system is coordinated by lymphocytes (a class of
leukocyte) and results in the production of antibodies

-   B lymphocytes (B cells) are antibody-producing cells that recognise
    and target a particular pathogen fragment (antigen)
-   HelperÂ TÂ lymphocytesÂ (T_(H)Â cells) are regulator cells that
    release chemicals (cytokines) to activate specific B lymphocytes

When phagocytic leukocytes engulf a pathogen, some will present the
digested fragments (antigens) on their surface

-   These antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells) migrate to the
    lymph nodes and activate specific helper T lymphocytes
-   The helper T cells then release cytokines to activate the particular
    B cell capable of producing antibodies specific to the antigen
-   The activated B cell will divide and differentiate to form
    short-lived plasma cells that produce high amounts of specific
    antibody
-   Antibodies will target their specific antigen, enhancing the
    capacity of the immune system to recognise and destroy the pathogen
-   A small proportion of activated B cell (and activated T_(H) cell)
    will develop into memory cells to provide long-lasting immunity

Activation of the Adaptive Immune System

Antibodies

Antigen: Â An antigen is a substance that the body recognises as foreign
and that will elicit an immune response

Antibody: Â An antibody is a protein produced by B lymphocytes (and
plasma cells) that is specific to a given antigen

-   Antibodies are made of 4 polypeptide chains that are joined together
    by disulphide bonds to form Y-shaped molecules
-   The ends of the arms are where the antigen binds â€“ these areas are
    called the variable regions and differ between antibodies
-   The rest of the molecule is constant across all antibodies and
    serves as a recognition site for the immune system (opsonisation)
-   Each type of antibody recognises a unique antigen, making
    antigen-antibody interactions specific (like enzymes and substrates)

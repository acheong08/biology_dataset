Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some fatty acids and some amino acids are essential

Â  Â Â 
Humans can synthesise most fatty acids from carbohydrates, but two
(cis)-polyunsaturatedÂ fatty acids are considered essential

-   Alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an
    omega-6 fatty acid) cannot be synthesised by the body
-   This is because humans lack the enzyme required to introduce double
    bonds at the required position of the carbon chain

Essential fatty acids are modified by the body to make important
lipid-based compounds (such as signalling molecules)

-   There is evidence to suggest dietary deficiencies of these fatty
    acids may be linked to impaired brain development (e.g. depression)
    and altered maintenance of cardiac tissue (e.g. abnormal heart
    function) â€“ although this evidence is contested

Foods rich in essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) include fish,
leafy vegetables and walnuts

Application:

â€¢ Â Cholesterol in blood as an indicator of the risk of coronary heart
disease

Â  Â Â 
Fats and cholesterol cannot dissolve in the bloodstream and so are
packaged with proteins (to form lipoproteins) for transport

-   Low density lipoproteins (LDLs) carry cholesterol from the liver to
    the body (hence raise blood cholesterol levels)
-   High density lipoproteins (HDLs) carry excess cholesterol back to
    the liver for disposal (hence lower blood cholesterol levels)

The mix of fatty acids consumed as part of a diet directly influences
the levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream:

-   Saturated fats increase LDL levels within the body, raising blood
    cholesterol levelsÂ 
-   TransÂ fats increase LDL levels and lower HDL levels, significantly
    raising blood cholesterol levels
-   Cis-polyunsaturated fats raise HDL levels, lowering blood
    cholesterol levels

High cholesterol levels in the bloodstream lead to the hardening and
narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis)

-   When there are high levels of LDL in the bloodstream, the LDL
    particles will form deposits in the walls of the arteries
-   The accumulation of fat within the arterial wall leads to the
    development of plaques which restrict blood flow
-   If coronary arteries become blocked, coronary heart disease (CHD)
    will result â€“ this includes heart attacks and strokes

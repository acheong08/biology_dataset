Understanding:

â€¢ Â Natural selection increases the frequency of characteristics that
make individuals better adapted and decreasesÂ 

Â  Â  the frequency of other characteristics leading to changes within
the species

Â  Â Â 
The theory of natural selection was posited by Charles Darwin (and also
Alfred Wallace) who described it asÂ â€˜survival of the fittestâ€™

-   According to this theory, it is not necessarily the strongest or
    most intelligent that survives, but the ones most responsive to
    change

The process of natural selection occurs in response to a number of
conditions:

-   Inherited Variation â€“ There is genetic variation within a
    population which can be inherited
-   Competition â€“ There is a struggle for survival (species tend to
    produce more offspring than the environment can support)
-   Selection â€“ Environmental pressures lead to differential
    reproduction within a population
-   Adaptations â€“ Individuals with beneficial traits will be more
    likely to survive and pass these traits on to their offspring
-   Evolution â€“ Over time, there is a change in allele frequency
    within the population gene pool

Natural Selection Mnemonic

[ice age]

The key components to the process of natural selection are:

-   Inherited variation exists within the population
-   Competition results from an overproduction of offspring
-   Environmental pressures lead to differential reproduction
-   Adaptations which benefit survival are selected for
-   Genotype frequency changes across generations
-   Evolution occurs within the population

Cancer Cells

Cancer cells can commonly avoid immune detection as they are not foreign
bodies but abnormally functioning body cells

This makes them difficult to treat â€“ common strategies involve
surgical removal and chemotherapy

However there are a number of differences between normal and cancerous
tissues which may provide the basis for the development of future
therapies

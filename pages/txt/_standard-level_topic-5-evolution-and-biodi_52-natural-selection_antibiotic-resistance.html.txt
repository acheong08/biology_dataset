â€¢ Â Evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria

Â  Â Â 
Antibiotics are chemicals produced by microbes that either kill
(bactericidal) or inhibit the growth (bacteriostatic) of bacteria

-   Antibiotics are commonly used by man as a treatment for bacterial
    infections (not effective against viral infections)

In a bacterial colony, over many generations, a small proportion of
bacteria may develop antibiotic resistance via gene mutation

-   When treated with antibiotics, the resistant bacteria will survive
    and reproduce by binary fission (asexual reproduction)
-   The antibiotic resistant bacteria will flourish in the absence of
    competition from other strains of bacteria (killed by antibiotic)
-   Antibiotic resistant bacteria may also confer resistance to
    susceptible strains by transferring plasmids via bacterial
    conjugation
-   The introduction of antibiotic (selection pressure) has caused the
    antibiotic resistance gene to become more frequent (evolution)

An example of antibiotic resistance in bacteria can be seen in the
evolution of Staphylococcus aureus (Golden staph)

-   Golden staph can cause infections to the skin (lesions and boils) as
    well as more serious infections (pneumonia, meningitis)
-   Historically, these infections were treated using the antibiotic
    methicillinÂ 
-   Bacterial strains developed that were resistant to this antibiotic
    (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus â€“ or MRSA)
-   These strains proliferated whileÂ susceptible strains died
    outÂ (methicillin-sensitiveÂ Staphylococcus aureusÂ â€“ or MSSA)
-   MRSA infections are now especially present in hospitals and nursing
    homes, where the use of methicillin was most common
-   Medical practitioners now prescribe alternate antibiotic agents to
    treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus

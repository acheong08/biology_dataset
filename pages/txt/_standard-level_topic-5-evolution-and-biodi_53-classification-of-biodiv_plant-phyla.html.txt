â€¢ Â Recognition features of bryophyta, filicinophyta, coniferophyta
and angiospermophyta

Â  Â Â 
The kingdom Plantae contains 12 phyla â€“ which includes bryophytes,
filicinophytes, coniferophytes and angiospermophytes

-   These phyla can be differentiated according to a few key recognition
    features

[bryophyte icon]

Bryophyta

-   Has no vascularisation (i.e. lacks xylem and phloem)
-   Has noÂ â€˜trueâ€™Â leaves, roots or stems (are anchored by a
    root-like structure called a rhizoid)
-   Reproduce by releasing spores from sporangia (reproductive stalks)
-   Examples include mosses and liverworts

[filicinophyte icon]

Filicinophyta

-   Has vascularisation (i.e xylem and phloem)
-   Have leaves, roots and stems (leaves are pinnate â€“ consisting of
    large fronds divided into leaflets)
-   Reproduce by releasing spores from clusters called sori on the
    underside of the leaves
-   Examples include ferns

[coniferophyte icon]

Coniferophyta

-   Has vascularisation
-   Have leaves, roots and stems (stems are woody and leaves are waxy
    and needle-like)
-   Reproduce by non-motile gametes (seeds) which are found in cones
-   Examples include pine trees and conifers

[angiosperm icon]

Angiospermophyta

-   Has vascularisation
-   Have leaves, roots and stems (individual species may be highly
    variable in structure)
-   Reproduce by seeds produced in ovules within flowers (seeds may
    develop in fruits)
-   Examples include all flowering plants and grasses

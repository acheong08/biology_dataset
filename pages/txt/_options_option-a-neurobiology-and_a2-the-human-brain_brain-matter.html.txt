Brain Matter

The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can be characterised
by two distinct regions â€“ white matter and grey matter

-   White matter is composed of bundles of myelinated axons which
    connect the various grey matter regions together
-   Myelin acts as an insulator and hence nerve signals are transmitted
    at greater speed through white matter
-   Grey matter is composed of the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites,
    as well as unmyelinated nerve fibres
-   Grey matter functions as the regions of the brain where information
    is processed

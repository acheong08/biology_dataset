â€¢ Â Construction of Punnett grids for predicting the outcome of
monohybrid genetic crossesÂ 

Â  Â Â 
A monohybrid cross determines the allele combinations for potential
offspring for one gene only

Monohybrid crosses can be calculated according to the following steps:

-   Step 1: Â Designate letters to represent alleles (dominant = capital
    letter ; recessive = lower case ; co-dominant = superscript)
-   Step 2: Â Write down the genotype and phenotype of the prospective
    parents (this is the P generation)
-   Step 3: Â Write down the genotype of the parental gametes (these
    will be haploid and thus consist of a single allele each)
-   Step 4: Â Draw a grid with maternal gametes along the top and
    paternal gametes along the left (this is a Punnett grid)
-   Step 5: Â Complete the Punnett grid to determine potential genotypes
    and phenotypes of offspring (this is the F₁ generation)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Comparison of predicted and actual outcomes of genetic crosses
using real data

Â  Â Â 
The genotypic and phenotypic ratios calculated via Punnett grids are
only probabilities and may not always reflect actual trends

-   E.g. When flipping a coin there is a 50% chance of landing on heads
    â€“ this doesnâ€™t mean you will land on heads 50% of the time

When comparing predicted outcomes to actual data, larger data sets are
more likely to yield positive correlations

-   Gregor Mendel performed over 5,000 crosses as part of his pea plant
    experiment
-   However many statisticians believe Mendelâ€™s results are too close
    to the exact ratios predicted to be genuine

Mendelâ€™s Pea Plant Experimental Data

[Mendel's data]

Mendel crossed different varieties of pea plants and recorded the
characteristics of resultant offspring

-   Initially, he crossed purebred dominant and purebred recessive
    plants in order to produce heterozygotes (F₁ generation)
-   He then self-pollinated the heterozygotes to produce an F₂
    generation and counted the dominant and recessive phenotypes
-   The expected ratio of dominant : recessive phenotypes was 3 : 1 â€“
    this ratio was supported by the experimental data

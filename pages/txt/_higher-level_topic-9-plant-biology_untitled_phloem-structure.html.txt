Application:

â€¢ Â Structure-function relationships of phloem sieve tubes

Â  Â Â 
Phloem sieve tubes are primarily composed of two main types of cells â€“
sieve element cells and companion cells

-   The phloem also contains schlerenchymal and parenchymal cells which
    fill additional spaces and provide support

Sieve Element Cells

Sieve elements are long and narrow cells that are connected together to
form the sieve tube

-   Sieve elements are connected by sieve plates at their transverse
    ends, which are porous to enable flow between cells
-   Sieve elements have no nuclei and reduced numbers of organelles to
    maximise space for the translocation of materials
-   The sieve elements also have thick and rigid cell walls to withstand
    the hydrostatic pressures which facilitate flow

Companion Cells

Provide metabolic support for sieve element cells and facilitate the
loading and unloading of materials at source and sink

-   Possess an infolding plasma membrane which increases SA:Vol ratio to
    allow for more material exchange
-   Have many mitochondria to fuel the active transport of materials
    between the sieve tube and the source or sink
-   Contain appropriate transport proteins within the plasma membrane to
    move materials into or out of the sieve tube

Sieve elements are unable to sustain independent metabolic activity
without the support of a companion cell

-   This is because the sieve element cells have no nuclei and fewer
    organelles (to maximise flow rate)
-   Plasmodesmata exist between sieve elements and companion cells in
    relatively large numbers
-   These connect the cytoplasm of the two cells and mediate the
    symplastic exchange of metabolites

Skill:

â€¢ Â Identification of xylem and phloem in microscope images of stem
and root

Â  Â Â 
Xylem and phloem vessels are grouped into bundles that extend from the
roots to the shoots in vascular plants

-   Differences in distribution and arrangement exist between plant
    types (e.g. monocotyledons vs dicotyledons)
-   Xylem and phloem vessels can usually be differentiated by the
    diameter of their cavity (xylem have larger cavities)

Roots

-   In monocotyledons, the stele is large and vessels will form a
    radiating circle around the central pith
    -   Xylem vessels will be located more internally and phloem vessels
        will be located more externally
-   In dicotyledons, the stele is very small and the xylem is located
    centrally with the phloem surrounding it
    -   Xylem vessels may form a cross-like shape (â€˜Xâ€™ for xylem),
        while the phloem is situated in the surrounding gaps

Stem

-   In monocotyledons, the vascular bundles are found in a scattered
    arrangement throughout the stem
    -   Phloem vessels will be positioned externally (towards outside of
        stem) â€“ remember: Â phloem = outside Â 
-   In dicotyledons, the vascular bundles are arranged in a circle
    around the centre of the stem (pith)
    -   Phloem and xylem vessels will be separated by the cambium (xylem
        on inside ; phloem on outside)

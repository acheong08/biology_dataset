Understanding:

â€¢ Â Biopharming uses genetically modified animals and plants to
produce proteins for therapeutic use

Â  Â  Â Â 
Biopharming involves using transgenic plants or animals to produce
(orÂ â€˜farmâ€™) pharmaceutical products for therapeutic use

-   This involves the insertion of target genes into hosts (crops or
    animals) that would not normally express those genes
-   The desired compound can potentially be expressed in a form that is
    routinely harvested (e.g. milk, eggs, fruits, etc.)

There are several established examples of biopharming, including:

-   Transgenic sheep that produce humanÂ Î±-1-antitrypsin in their milk
    (individuals deficient in this enzyme develop emphysema)
-   Crops that express attenuated antigenic fragments for specific
    pathogenic diseases (i.e. edible vaccines)Â

Application:

â€¢ Â Biopharming of antithrombin

Â  Â  Â Â 
Antithrombin is a blood protein which inactivates certain enzymes in the
coagulation system to prevent excessive clotting

-   Individuals with a genetic or acquired antithrombin deficiency are
    at an increased risk of developing damaging blood clots

Genetically engineered antithrombin has been biopharmed from transgenic
goats to produce stocks for commercial use

-   A human gene encoding for antithrombin is introduced into the
    fertilised egg of a goat
-   The modified eggs are implanted into the uterus of surrogates, which
    give birth to transgenic offspring
-   The transgenic offspring will produce human antithrombin in its
    milk, which can then be extracted and purified
-   Each year, the transgenic goat can produce a quantity of
    antithrombin equivalent to 90,000 human blood donations

Skill:

â€¢ Â Deducing the DNA base sequence for the mRNA strand

Â  Â Â 
mRNAÂ â†’ DNA

mRNA is a complementary copy of a DNA segment (gene) and consequently
can be used to deduce the gene sequence

For converting a sequence from mRNA to the original DNA code, apply the
rules of complementary base pairing:

-   Cytosine (C) is replaced with Guanine (G) â€“ and viceÂ versa
-   Uracil (U) is replaced by Adenine (A)
-   Adenine (A) is replaced by Thymine (T)

Example:Â  Â (mRNA) Â AUG Â CCA Â GUG Â ACU Â UCA Â GGG Â ACG Â AAU
Â GAC Â UUA
Answer:Â  Â  Â  Â Â (DNA)Â  Â TAC Â GGT Â CAC Â TGA Â AGT Â CCC Â TGC
Â TTA Â CTG Â AAT

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use a table of mRNA codons and their corresponding amino acids to
deduce the sequence of amino acids

Â  Â coded by a short mRNA strand of known base sequence

Â  Â Â 
mRNAÂ â†’ Polypeptide

In order to translate an mRNA sequence into a polypeptide chain, it is
important to establish the correct reading frame

The mRNA transcript is organised into triplets of bases called codons,
and as such three different reading frames exists

-   An open reading frame starts with AUG and will continue in triplets
    to a termination codon
-   A blocked reading frame may be frequently interrupted by termination
    codons

Once the start codon (AUG) has been located and reading frame
established, the corresponding amino acid sequence can be deduced using
the genetic codeÂ 

Example:Â Â Â (mRNA)Â Â GUAUGCACGUGACUUUCCUCAUGAGCUGAU
Answer:Â  Â Â (codons)Â Â GU Â AUGÂ Â CAC Â GUG Â ACU Â UUC Â CUC Â AUG
Â AGC Â UGAÂ Â U
Answer:Â  Â (amino acid) Â  Â Â Met Â  Â His Â  Â  Val Â  Â Â Thr Â 
Â Phe Â Â Â Leu Â Â Â Met Â  Â Ser Â  STOP

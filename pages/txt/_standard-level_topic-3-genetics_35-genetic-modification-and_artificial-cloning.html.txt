Understanding:

â€¢ Â Animals can be cloned at the embryo stage by breaking up the
embryo into more than one group of cells

Â  Â Â 
At a very early stage, embryonic cells retain pluripotency (meaning they
can divide and become any type of tissue)

-   These cells will differentiate to form all the different tissues
    comprising the organism

If these embryonic cells are separated artificially in the laboratory,
each group of cells will form cloned organisms

-   This separation of embryonic cells can also occur naturally to give
    rise to identical (monozygotic) twins

The separation of embryonic cells has to happen early in the
developmental cycle, ideally around the 8 cell stage (morula)

-   The separated groups of cells are then implanted into the uterus of
    a surrogate to develop into genetically identical clones

This method of cloning is limited by the fact that the embryo used is
still formed randomly via sexual reproduction and so the specific
genetic features of the resulting clones have yet to be determined

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Methods have been developed for cloning adult organisms using
differentiated cells

Â  Â Â 
A second and more reliable method of artificial cloning involves somatic
cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)

-   This involves replacing the haploid nucleus of an unfertilised egg
    with a diploid nucleus from an adult donorÂ 
-   The advantage of this technique is that it is known what traits the
    clones will develop (they are genetically identical to the donor)

This method of using differentiated cells to generate cloned embryos can
be used for two main purposes:

-   Reproductive cloning:Â  If the embryo is implanted into the uterus
    of a surrogate, a new cloned organism will develop
-   Therapeutic cloning:Â  Embryonic cells can be induced to
    differentiate to create specific tissues or organs for
    transplantation

Application:

â€¢ Â Structure and function of cellulose and starch in plants and
glycogen in humans

Â  Â Â 
Polysaccharides are carbohydrate polymers comprised of many (hundreds to
thousands) monosaccharide monomers

The type of polymer formed depends on the monosaccharide subunits
involved and the bonding arrangement between them

Three key polymers can be made from glucose monosaccharides â€“
cellulose, starch (in plants) and glycogen (in animals)

Cellulose

Cellulose is a structural polysaccharide that is found in the cell wall
of plants

It is a linear molecule composed ofÂ Î²-glucose subunits (bound in a 1-4
arrangement)

Because it is composed ofÂ Î²-glucose, it is indigestible for most
animals (lack the enzyme required to break it down)

-   Ruminants (e.g. cows) may digest cellulose due to the presence of
    helpful bacteria in a specialised stomach
-   Caecotrophs (e.g. rabbits) will re-ingest specialised faeces that
    contain digested cellulose (broken down in the caecum)

Starch

Starch is an energy storage polysaccharide found in plants

It is composed ofÂ Î±-glucose subunits (bound in a 1-4 arrangement) and
exists in one of two forms â€“ amylose or amylopectin

-   Amylose is a linear (helical) molecule while amylopectin is branched
    (contains additional 1-6 linkages)
-   Amylose is harder to digest and less soluble, however, as it takes
    up less space, is the preferred storage form in plants

Glycogen

Glycogen is an energy storage polysaccharide formed in the liver in
animals

It is composed ofÂ Î±-glucose subunits linked together by both 1-4
linkages and 1-6 linkages (branching)

-   It is akin to amylopectin in plants, but is more highly branched
    (1-6 linkages occur every ~10 subunits as opposed to ~20)

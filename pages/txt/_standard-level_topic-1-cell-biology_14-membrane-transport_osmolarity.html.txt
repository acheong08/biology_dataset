Skill:

â€¢ Â Estimation of osmolarity in tissues by bathing samples in
hypotonic and hypertonic solutions

Â  Â Â 
Osmolarity is a measure of solute concentration, as defined by the
number ofÂ osmoles of a solute per litre of solution (osmol/L)

Solutions may be loosely categorised as hypertonic, hypotonic or
isotonic according to their relative osmolarity

-   Solutions with a relatively higher osmolarity are categorised as
    hypertonic (high solute concentrationÂ â‡’ gains water)
-   Solutions with a relatively lower osmolarity are categorised as
    hypotonic (low solute concentrationÂ â‡’Â loses water)
-   Solutions that have the same osmolarity are categorised as isotonic
    (same solute concentrationÂ â‡’Â no net water flow)

Estimating Osmolarity

The osmolarity of a tissue may be interpolated by bathing the sample in
solutions with known osmolarities

-   The tissue will lose water when placed in hypertonic solutions and
    gain water when placed in hypotonic solutions
-   Water loss or gain may be determined by weighing the sample before
    and after bathing in solution
-   Tissue osmolarity may be inferred by identifying the concentration
    of solution at which there is no weight change (i.e. isotonic)

Application:

â€¢ Â Tissues or organs to be used in medical procedures must be bathed
in a solution with the same osmolarityÂ 

Â  Â as the cytoplasm to prevent osmosis

Â  Â Â 
Tissues or organs to be used in medical procedures must be kept in
solution to prevent cellular dessication

This solution must share the same osmolarity as the tissue / organ (i.e.
isotonic) in order to prevent osmosis from occurring

Uncontrolled osmosis will have negative effects with regards to cell
viability:

-   In hypertonic solutions, water will leave the cell causing it to
    shrivel (crenation)
-   In hypotonic solutions, water will enter the cell causing it to
    swell and potentially burst (lysis)

In plant tissues, the effects of uncontrolled osmosis are moderated by
the presence of an inflexible cell wall

-   In hypertonic solutions, the cytoplasm will shrink (plasmolysis) but
    the cell wall will maintain a structured shape
-   In hypotonic solutions, the cytoplasm will expand but be unable to
    rupture within the constraints of the cell wall (turgor)

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of artificial pacemakers to regulate the heart rate

Â  Â Â 
An artificial pacemaker is a medical device that delivers electrical
impulses to the heart in order to regulate heart rate

-   Modern pacemakers are externally programmable, allowing
    cardiologists to make adjustments as required

Artificial pacemakers are typically used to treat one of two
conditions:Â 

-   Abnormally slow heart rates (bradycardia)
-   Arrhythmias arising from blockages within the heartâ€™s electrical
    conduction system

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of defibrillation to treat life threatening cardiac conditions

Â  Â Â 
Fibrillation is the rapid, irregular and unsynchronised contraction of
the heart muscle fibres

-   This causes heart muscle to convulse spasmodically rather than beat
    in concert, preventing the optimal flow of blood

Fibrillation is treated by applying a controlled electrical current to
the heart via a device called a defibrillator

-   This functions to depolarise the heart tissue in an effort to
    terminate unsynchronised contractions
-   Once heart tissue is depolarised, normal sinus rhythm should
    hopefully be re-established by the sinoatrial node

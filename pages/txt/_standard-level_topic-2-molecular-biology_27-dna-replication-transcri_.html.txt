2.7 Â DNA Replication, Transcription & Translation

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Genetic information in DNA can be accurately copied and
can be translated to makeÂ the proteins needed by the cell

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The replication of DNA is semi-conservative and depends on
    complementary base pairing
-   Helicase unwinds the double helix and separates the two strands by
    breaking hydrogen bonds
-   DNA polymerase links nucleotides together to form a new strand,
    using the pre-existing strand as a template
-   Transcription is the synthesis of mRNA copied from the DNA base
    sequences by RNA polymerase
-   Translation is the synthesis of polypeptides on ribosomes
-   The amino acid sequence of polypeptides is determined by mRNA
    according to the genetic code
-   Codons of three bases on mRNA correspond to one amino acid in a
    polypeptide
-   Translation depends on complementary base pairing between codons on
    mRNA and anticodons on tRNA

Applications:

-   Use of Taq DNA polymerase to produce multiple copies of DNA rapidly
    by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
-   Production of human insulin in bacteria as an example of the
    universality of the genetic code allowing for gene transfer between
    species

Skills:

-   Use a table of the genetic code to deduce which codon(s) correspond
    to which amino acid
-   Analysis of Meselson and Stahlâ€™s results to obtain support for the
    theory of semi-conservative replication of DNA
-   Use a table of mRNA codons and their corresponding amino acids to
    deduce the sequence of amino acids coded by a short mRNA strand of
    known base sequence
-   Deducing the DNA base sequence for the mRNA strand

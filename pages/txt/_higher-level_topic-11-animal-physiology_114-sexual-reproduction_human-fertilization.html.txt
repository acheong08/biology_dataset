Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fertilization involves mechanisms that prevent polyspermy

Â  Â Â 
The process of fertilization in humans involves a number of key
processes, including:

-   Capacitation â€“ biochemical changes which occur post ejaculation to
    improve sperm motility
-   Acrosome reaction â€“ the release of hydrolytic enzymes which
    softens the zona pellucida (jelly coat)
-   Cortical reaction â€“ hardening of the jelly coat post fertilization
    to prevent potential polyspermy

1. Â Capacitation

Capacitation occurs after ejaculation, when chemicals released by the
uterus dissolve the spermâ€™s cholesterol coat

-   This improves sperm motility (hyperactivity), meaning sperm is more
    likely to reach the egg (in the oviduct)
-   It also destabilises the acrosome cap, which is necessary for the
    acrosome reaction to occur upon egg and sperm contact

2. Â Acrosome Reaction

When the sperm reaches an egg, the acrosome reaction allows the sperm to
break through the surrounding jelly coat

-   The sperm pushes through the follicular cells of the corona radiata
    and binds to the zonaÂ pellucida (jelly coat)
-   The acrosome vesicle fuses with the jelly coat and releases
    digestive enzymes which soften the glycoprotein matrix
-   The sperm then pushes its way through the softened jelly coat and
    binds to exposed docking proteins on the egg membrane
-   The membrane of the egg and sperm then fuse and the sperm nucleus
    (and centriole) enters the egg

3. Â Cortical Reaction

The cortical reaction occurs once a sperm has successfully penetrated an
egg in order to prevent polyspermy

-   Cortical granules within the eggâ€™s cytoplasm release enzymes (via
    exocytosis) into the zona pellucida (jelly coat)
-   These enzymes destroy sperm binding sites and also thicken and
    harden the glycoprotein matrix of the jelly coat
-   This prevents other sperm from being able to penetrate the egg
    (polyspermy), ensuring the zygote formed is diploidÂ

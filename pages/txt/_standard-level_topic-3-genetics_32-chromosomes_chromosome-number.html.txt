Understanding:

â€¢ Â The number of chromosomes is a characteristic feature of members
of a particular species

Â  Â Â 
Chromosome number is a characteristic feature of members of a particular
species

-   Organisms with different diploid numbers are unlikely to be able to
    interbreed (cannot formÂ homologous pairs in zygotes)
-   In cases where different species do interbreed, offspring are
    usually infertile (cannot form functional gametes)
    -   For instance, a horse (diploid = 64) and a donkey (diploid = 62)
        may produce an infertile mule (non-diploid = 63)

Chromosome Number and Hybrid Infertility

Application:

â€¢ Â Comparison of diploid chromosome numbers of Homo sapiens, Pan
troglodytes, CanisÂ familiaris,Â 

Â  Â OryzaÂ sativaÂ and Parascaris equorum

Â  Â Â 
Chromosome number does not provide a valid indication of genetic
complexity, for instance:

-   Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) have 24 chromosomes and a genome
    size of 950 million bp, but possess ~32,000 genes
-   Chickens (Gallus gallus) have 78 chromosomes and a genome size of
    1.2 billion bp, but possess only ~17,000 genes

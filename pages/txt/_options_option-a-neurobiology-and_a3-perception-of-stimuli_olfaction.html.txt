Application:

â€¢ Â Detection of chemicals in the air by the many different olfactory
receptors

Â  Â Â 
Olfaction is the ability to detect airborne chemicals (odorants) as
scents or smells

-   At the back of the nasal cavity is a patch of tissue called the
    olfactory epithelium, which is embedded with chemoreceptors
-   The olfactory epithelium is lined with mucus, in which odorant
    molecules will dissolve before binding to the chemoreceptors
-   Binding of an odorant molecule will trigger a nerve impulse, which
    is transferred via the olfactory bulb to the brain
-   The combination of olfactory receptors activated determines the
    specific scent perceived by the brain

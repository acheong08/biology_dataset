Understanding:

â€¢ Â Particles move across membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, osmosis and active transport

Â  Â Â 
Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a semi-permeable
membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high
solute concentration (until equilibrium is reached)

-   Water is considered the universal solvent â€“ it will associate
    with, and dissolve, polar or charged molecules (solutes)
-   Because solutes cannot cross a cell membrane unaided, water will
    move to equalise the two solutions
-   At a higher solute concentration there are less free water molecules
    in solution as water is associated with the solute
-   Osmosis is essentially the diffusion of free water molecules and
    hence occurs from regions of low solute concentration

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Temperature, light intensity and CO₂ concentration are possible
limiting factors on the rate ofÂ photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 

[limiting factor]

The law of limiting factors states that when a chemical process depends
on more than one essential condition being favourable, the rate of
reaction will be limited by the factor that is nearest its minimum value

Photosynthesis is dependent on a number of favourable conditions,
including:

-   Temperature
-   Light intensity
-   Carbon dioxide concentration

Temperature

-   Photosynthesis is controlled by enzymes, which are sensitive to
    temperature fluctuations
-   As temperature increases reaction rate will increase, as reactants
    have greater kinetic energy and more collisions result
-   Above a certain temperature the rate of photosynthesis will decrease
    as essential enzymes begin to denature

The Effect of Temperature on Photosynthetic Rate

Light Intensity

-   Light is absorbed by chlorophyll, which convert the radiant energy
    into chemical energy (ATP)
-   As light intensity increases reaction rate will increase, as more
    chlorophyll are beingÂ photo-activated
-   At a certain light intensity photosynthetic rate will plateau, as
    all available chlorophyll are saturated with light
-   Different wavelengths of light will have different effects on the
    rate of photosynthesis (e.g. green light is reflected)

Carbon Dioxide Concentration

-   Carbon dioxide is involved in the fixation of carbon atoms to form
    organic molecules
-   As carbon dioxide concentration increases reaction rate will
    increase, as more organic molecules are being produced
-   At a certain concentration of CO₂ photosynthetic rate will plateau,
    as the enzymes responsible for carbon fixation are saturated

Skill:

â€¢ Â Design of experiments to investigate the effects of limiting
factors on photosynthesis

Â  Â Â 
Photosynthesis can be measured directly via the uptake of CO₂ or
production of O₂, or indirectly via a change in biomass

-   It is important to recognise that these levels may be influenced by
    the relative amount of cell respiration occurring in the tissue

Measuring CO₂ Uptake

-   Carbon dioxide uptake can be measured by placing leaf tissue in an
    enclosed space with water
-   Water free of dissolved carbon dioxide can initially be produced by
    boiling and cooling water
-   Carbon dioxide interacts with the water molecules, producing
    bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, which changes the pH (â†‘ acidity)
-   Increased uptake of CO₂ by the plant will lower the concentration in
    solution and increase the alkalinity (measure with probe)
-   Alternatively, carbon dioxide levels may be monitored via a data
    logger

Measuring O₂ Production

-   Oxygen production can be measured by submerging a plant in an
    enclosed water-filled space attached to a sealed gas syringe
-   Any oxygen gas produced will bubble out of solution and can be
    measured by a change in meniscus level on the syringe
-   Alternatively, oxygen production could be measured by the time taken
    for submerged leaf discs to surface
-   Oxygen levels can also be measured with a data logger if the
    appropriate probe is available

Measuring Biomass (Indirect)

-   Glucose production can be indirectly measured by a change in the
    plantâ€™s biomass (weight)
-   This requires the plant tissue to be completely dehydrated prior to
    weighing to ensure the change in biomass represents organic matter
    and not water content
-   An alternative method for measuring glucose production is to
    determine the change in starch levels (glucose is stored as starch)
-   Starch can be identified via iodine staining (turns starch solution
    purple) and quantitated using a colorimeterÂ

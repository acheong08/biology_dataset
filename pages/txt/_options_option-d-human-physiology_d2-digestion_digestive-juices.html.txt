Digestive Juices

The digestive system contains numerous organs that contribute to the
secretion of digestive juices

-   These organs include the salivary glands, stomach, liver, pancreas
    and small intestine

Organs Involved in Digestive Juice Production

[digestive juice organs]

Salivary Glands

-   Initiate chemical digestion while food is still being physically
    chewed within the mouth
-   SecretesÂ salivary amylase, which assists in the breakdown of
    glucose polymers (e.g. starch)

Stomach

-   Produces stomach acids which aid in the chemical breakdown of food
    materials
-   Secretes proteases to function as the initial site of protein
    digestion
-   Stomach proteases typically require acid conditions for activation
    (e.g. pepsinogenÂ â†’Â pepsin)

Liver

-   Produces bile which is responsible for the emulsification of fats
    (separates fats globules to enhance lipase activity)
-   Bile produced in the liver is commonly stored in the gall bladder
    until release

Pancreas

-   Secretes bicarbonate ions into the duodenum to neutralise stomach
    acids (intestine pH is usually ~ 7 â€“ 8)
-   Also secretes lipase (for fat digestion), amylase (for carbohydrate
    digestion) and protease (for protein digestion)
-   Pancreatic proteases are activated by enzymes and not by acid
    conditions (enterokinase converts trypsinogen to trypsin)

Small Intestine

-   Intestinal juices are secreted from pits called crypts
    ofÂ Leiberkuhn, located between intestinal villiÂ 
-   Digestive enzymes in the small intestine are typically immobilised
    on the epithelial membrane (e.g. maltase)
-   This prevents the enzymes from being removed from the body as part
    of the normal digestive cycle
-   It also concentrates the digestive products at sites where membrane
    proteins are present (to optimise absorption)

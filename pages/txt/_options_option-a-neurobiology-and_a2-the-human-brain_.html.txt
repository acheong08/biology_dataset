A2 Â The Human Brain

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The parts of the brain
specialise in different functions

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The anterior part of the neural tube expands to form the brain
-   Different parts of the brain have specific roles
-   The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes in the
    body using centres located mainly in the brainstem
-   The cerebral cortex forms a larger proportion of the brain and is
    more highly developed in humans than other animals
-   The human cerebral cortex has become enlarged principally by an
    increase in total area with extensive folding to accommodate it
    within the cranium
-   The cerebral hemispheres are responsible for higher order functions
-   The left cerebral hemisphere receives sensory inputs from sensory
    receptors in the right side of the body and the right side of the
    visual field in both eyes and vice versa for the right hemisphere
-   The left cerebral hemisphere controls muscle contraction in the
    right side of the body and vice versa for the right hemisphere
-   Brain metabolism requires large energy inputs

Applications:

-   Visual cortex, Brocaâ€™s area, nucleus accumbens as areas of the
    brain with specific functions
-   Swallowing, breathing and heart rate as examples of activities
    coordinated by the medulla
-   Use of the pupil reflex to evaluate brain damage
-   Use of animal experiments, autopsy, lesions and fMRI to identify the
    role of different brain parts

Skills:

-   Identification of parts of the brain in a photograph, diagram or
    scan of the brain
-   Analysis of correlations between body size and brain size in
    different animals

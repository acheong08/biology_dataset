D3 Â Functions of the Liver

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
The chemical composition of the
blood is regulated by the liver

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The liver intercepts blood from the gut to regulate nutrient levels
-   Some nutrients in excess can be stored in the liver
-   Surplus cholesterol is converted into bile salts
-   The liver removes toxins from the blood and detoxifies them
-   Endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in hepatocytes produce
    plasma proteins
-   Components of red blood cells are recycled by the liver
-   The breakdown of erythrocytes starts with phagocytosis of red blood
    cells by Kupffer cells
-   Iron is carried to the bone marrow to produce haemoglobin in new red
    blood cells

Applications:

-   Dual blood supply to the liver and differences between sinusoids and
    capillaries
-   Causes and consequences of jaundice

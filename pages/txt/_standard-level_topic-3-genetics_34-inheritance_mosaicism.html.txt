Mosaicism

Mosaicism describes the presence of two populations of cells with
distinct genotypes within a single organism

-   It is caused when either mutation or division error creates two
    distinct cell types which divide into separate cell lines

Mosaicism is more pronounced when errors occur in early embryo
development and thus affects a greater proportion of cells

-   X-inactivation in mammals creates a mosaic of genotypes linked to
    the X chromosome only, and hence is not true mosaicism

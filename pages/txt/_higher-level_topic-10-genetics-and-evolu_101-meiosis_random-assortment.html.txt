Understanding:

â€¢ Â Independent assortment of genes is due to the random orientation
of pairs of homologous chromosomesÂ 

Â  Â  in meiosis I

Â  Â Â 
Independent assortment describes how pairs of alleles separate
independently from one another during gamete formation

-   According to independent assortment, the inheritance of one
    gene/trait is independent to the inheritance of any other gene/trait
-   Independent assortment is due to the random orientation of pairs of
    homologous chromosomes in meiosis I

DuringÂ metaphase I, homologous chromosomes line up at the equator as
bivalents in one of two arrangements:

-   Maternal copy left / paternal copy rightÂ Â ORÂ Â paternal copy left
    / maternal copy right

The orientation of each homologous pair isÂ random and is notÂ affected
by the orientation of any other homologous pair

-   This means an allele on one chromosome has an equal chance of being
    paired with, or separated from, any allele on another chromosome
    (their inheritance is independent of one another)

Independent assortment will not occur if two genes are located on the
same chromosome (linked genes)

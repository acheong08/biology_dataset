Fossilisation

Fossilisation is a rare process, the vast majority of deceased organisms
disappear without leaving a trace

In order forÂ fossilisation to occur, the following conditions are
required:

-   Hard body parts (bones, teeth, shells) â€“ soft body parts will not
    fossilise, but may leave behind trace evidence (e.g. imprints)
-   Preservation of remains (protection against scavenging, erosion and
    environmental damage)
-   High pressure to promote mineralisation of remains (i.e. turn hard
    body parts into fossilised rocks)
-   Anoxic (low oxygen) conditions to protect against oxygen damage and
    prevent decomposition by saprotrophs

The stages of fossilisation generally occur as follows:

1. Â Death and decay â€“ Soft body parts are decomposed or scavenged,
leaving only the hard body remains

2. Â Deposition â€“ The hard remains are rapidly covered with silt and
sand, and over time more layers continue to build

3. Â Permineralisation â€“ Pressure from the covering layers of
dirt/rock cause the hard organic material to be replaced by minerals

4. Â Erosion / exposure â€“ Movement of earth plates may displace the
fossil and return it to the surface for discovery

Understanding:

â€¢ Â According to the cell theory, living organisms are composed of
cells

Â  Â Â 
Principles of the Cell Theory

The cell theory states that:

1. Â All living things are composed of cells (or cell products)

2. Â The cell is the smallest unit of life

3. Â Cells only arise from pre-existing cells

Application:

â€¢ Â Questioning the cell theory using atypical examples (striated
muscle, giant algae, aseptate hyphae)

Caveats to the Cell Theory

Certain types of cells / tissues do not conform to a standard notion of
what constitutes a cell:

-   Striated muscle fibres:
    -   Muscle cells fuse to form fibres that may be very long (>300mm)
    -   Consequently, they have multiple nuclei despite being surrounded
        by a single, continuous plasma membrane
    -   Challenges the idea that cells always function as autonomous
        units
-   Aseptate fungal hyphae:
    -   Fungi may have filamentous structures called hyphae, which are
        separated into cells by internal walls called septa
    -   Some fungi are not partitioned by septa and hence have a
        continuous cytoplasm along the length of the hyphae
    -   Challenges the idea that living structures are composed of
        discrete cells
-   Giant Algae
    -   Certain species of unicellular algae may grow to very large
        sizes (e.g. Acetabularia may exceed 7 cm in length)
    -   Challenges the idea that larger organisms are always made of
        many microscopic cells

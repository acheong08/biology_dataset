Understanding:

â€¢ Â B lymphocytes are activated by T lymphocytes in mammals

â€¢ Â Activated B cells multiply to form clones of plasma cells and
memory cells

Â  Â Â 
When the body is challenged by a foreign pathogen it will respond with
both a non-specific and a specific immune reaction

-   Non-specific immune cells called macrophages will engulf pathogens
    non-selectively and break them down internally
-   A proportion of macrophages (dendritic cells) will present the
    antigenic fragments of the pathogen to specific lymphocytesÂ 

The body contains millions of different T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes
that each recognise a single, specific antigen

-   Antigenic fragments are presented to specific helper T lymphocytes
    (T_(H)Â cells) that, when activated, releases cytokines
-   The cytokines stimulate a specific B cell that produces antibodies
    to the antigen toÂ divide and form clones (clonal selection)
-   Most of the clones will develop into short-lived plasma cells that
    produce large quantities of specific antibody
-   A small proportion of clones will differentiate into long-lived
    memory cells that function to provide long-term immunity

Pathogens typically contain multiple distinct antigenic fragments on
their surface and hence a single pathogen is likely to stimulate several
different T and B lymphocytes to produce a variety of specific
antibodies (polyclonal activation)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Spermatogenesis and oogenesis both involve mitosis, cell growth,
two divisions of meiosis and differentiation

Â  Â Â 
GametogenesisÂ is the process by which diploid precursor cells undergo
meiotic division to become haploid gametes (sex cells)

-   In males, this process is called spermatogenesis and produce
    spermatozoa (sperm)
-   In females, this process is called oogenesis and produce ova (eggs)

The process of gametogenesis occurs in the gonads and involves the
following steps:

-   Multiple mitotic divisions and cell growth of precursor germ cells
-   Two meiotic divisions (meiosis I and II) to produce haploid daughter
    cells
-   Differentiation of the haploid daughter cells to produce functional
    gametes

Spermatogenesis

-   Spermatogenesis describes the producton of spermatozoa (sperm) in
    the seminiferous tubules of the testes
-   The process begins at puberty when the germline epithelium of the
    seminiferous tubules divides by mitosis
-   These cells (spermatogonia) then undergo a period of cell growth,
    becoming spermatocytes
-   The spermatocytes undergo two meiotic divisions to form four haploid
    daughter cells (spermatids)
-   The spermatids then undertake a process of differentiation in order
    to become functional sperm cells (spermatozoa)

Oogenesis

-   Oogenesis describes the production of female gametes (ova) within
    the ovaries (and, to a lesser extent, the oviduct)
-   The process begins during foetal development, when a large number of
    primordial cells are formed by mitosis (~40,000)
-   These cells (oogonia) undergo cell growth until they are large
    enough to undergo meiosis (becoming primary oocytes)
-   The primary oocytes begin meiosis but are arrested in prophase I
    when granulosa cells surround them to form follicles
-   The primary oocytes remain arrested in prophase I until puberty,
    when a girl begins her menstrual cycle
-   Each month, hormones (FSH) will trigger the continued division of
    some of the primary oocytesÂ 
-   These cells will complete the first meiotic division to form two
    cells of unequal size
-   One cell retains the entirety of the cytoplasm to form a secondary
    oocyte, while the other cell forms a polar body
-   The polar body remains trapped within the follicle until it
    eventually degenerates
-   The secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division but is
    arrested in metaphase II
-   The secondary oocyte is released from the ovary (ovulation) and
    enters into the oviduct (or fallopian tube)
-   The follicular cells surrounding the oocyte form a coronaÂ radiata
    and function to nourish the secondary oocyte
-   If the oocyte is fertilised by a sperm, chemical changes will
    trigger the completion of meiosis II and the formation of another
    polar body (the first polar body may also undergo a second division
    to form a third polar body)
-   Once meiosis II is complete the mature egg forms a ovum, before
    fusing its nucleus with the sperm nucleus to form a zygote

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis result in different
numbers of gametes with different amounts

Â  Â of cytoplasm

Â  Â Â 
While the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis follow the same
basic pathway, several key differences exist:

1. Â Number of cells produced

-   In spermatogenesis, the cells divide equally during meiosis to
    produce four functional gametes
-   In oogenesis, the cells do not divide equally and as a result only
    one functional gamete is formed (plus 2 â€“ 3 polar bodies)

2. Â Size of cells produced

-   In spermatogenesis, the cells that are formed following
    differentiation are all of equal size with equal amounts of
    cytoplasm
-   In oogenesis, one daughter cell (the ovum) retains all of the
    cytoplasm, while the other daughter cells form polar bodies
-   The polar bodies remain trapped within the surrounding layer of
    follicle cells until they eventually degenerate

3. Â Timing of the process

-   In spermatogenesis, the production of gametes is a continuous
    process that begins at puberty and continues until death
-   In oogenesis, the production of gametes is a staggered and finite
    process:
    -   It begins before birth (prenatally) with the formation of a
        fixed number of primary oocytes (~40,000)
    -   It continues with the onset of puberty according to a monthly
        menstrual cycle
    -   It ends when hormonal changes prevent the further continuance of
        the menstrual cycle (menopause)

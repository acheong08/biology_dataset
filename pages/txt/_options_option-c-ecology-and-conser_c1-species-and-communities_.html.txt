C1 Â Species and Communities

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Community structure is anÂ 
emergentÂ property of an ecosystem

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The distribution of species is affected by limiting factors
-   Community structure can be strongly affected by keystone species
-   Each species plays a unique role within a community because of the
    unique combination of its spatial habitat and interactions with
    other species
-   Interactions between species in a community can be classified
    according to their effect
-   Two species cannot survive indefinitely in the same habitat if their
    niches are identical

Applications:

-   Distribution of one animal and one plant species to illustrate
    limits of tolerance and zones of stress
-   Local examples to illustrate the range of ways in which species can
    interact within a community
-   The symbiotic relationship between Zooxanthellae andÂ reef-building
    coral reef species

Skills:

-   Analysis of a data set that illustrates the distinction between
    fundamental and realized niche
-   Use of a transect to correlate the distribution of plant or animal
    species with an abiotic variable

Fibrous vs Globular Proteins

There are two main classes of protein tertiary structure:

-   Fibrous proteins are generally composed of long and narrow strands
    and have a structural role (they are something)
-   Globular proteins generally have a more compact and rounded shape
    and have functional roles (they do something)

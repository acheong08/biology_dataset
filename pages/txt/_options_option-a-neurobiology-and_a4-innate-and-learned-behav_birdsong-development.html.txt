â€¢ Â The role of inheritance and learning in the development of
birdsong

Â  Â Â 
The development of birdsongs in fledglings is an example of an action
that involves both innate and learned behaviours

-   Birds will use songs as a means of communication â€“ either
    signalling courtship or establishing territorial boundaries

Most birds are born with a crude template song that is genetically
inherited (innate behaviour)

-   The possession of an innate template prevents birds from adopting
    the songs of a different species of bird

Whilst young, fledglings learn to expand and refine their song by
listening to, and mimicking, the adult version (motor learning)

-   Birds raised in isolation will lack the necessary song complexity
    that develops through social interaction

The time taken to develop a birdsong differs between species and songs,
but once established, the final song is rarely altered

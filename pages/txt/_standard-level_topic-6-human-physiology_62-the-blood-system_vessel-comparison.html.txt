â€¢ Â Identification of blood vessels as arteries, capillaries or veins
from the structure of their walls

Â  Â Â 
The difference in the structural characteristics of arteries,
capillaries and veins is attributable to their respective functions

-   Arteries have thick walls and narrow lumens because they transport
    blood at high pressure
-   Capillaries have walls that are only a single cell thick because
    they exchange materials between blood and tissue
-   Veins have thin walls with wide lumens and valves because they
    transport blood at low pressure

Identification of Blood Vessels

Blood vessels can be identified from histological slides or images
according to the thickness of their walls:

-   Arteries have thick walls composed of three distinct layers (tunica)
-   Veins have thin walls but typically have wider lumen (lumen size may
    vary depending on specific artery or vein)
-   Capillaries are very small and will not be easily detected under the
    same magnification as arteries and veins

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Methane is produced from organic matter in anaerobic conditions by
methanogenic archaeans and some

Â  Â  diffuses into the atmosphere or accumulates in the ground

Â  Â Â 

[carbon methane]

Methanogens are archaean microorganisms that produce methane (CH₄) as a
metabolic by-product in anaerobicÂ conditions

Anaerobic conditions where methanogens may be found include:

-   Wetlands (e.g. swamps and marshes)
-   Marine sediments (e.g. in the mud of lake beds)
-   Digestive tract of ruminant animals (e.g. cows, sheep, goats)

Methanogens produce methane from the by-products of anaerobic digestion,
principallyÂ acetic acid andÂ carbon dioxide:

-   Acetic acidÂ â†’Â Methane and Carbon Dioxide Â (CH₃COO^(â€“) + H⁺
    Â â†’Â  CH₄ + CO₂)
-   Carbon Dioxide and HydrogenÂ â†’Â Methane and Water Â (CO₂ + 4 H₂
    Â â†’Â Â CH₄ + 2 H₂O)

Methane may either accumulate under the ground or diffuse into the
atmosphere

-   When organic matter is buried in anoxic conditions (e.g. sea beds),
    deposits of methane (natural gas) may form underground
-   Rising global numbers of domesticated cattle may be increasing the
    levels of methane being released into the atmosphere

Stages of Methane Production in a Ruminant

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Methane is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere

Â  Â Â 

When methane is released into the atmosphere as a result of anaerobic
reactions, it only persists for ~12 years

Methane will be naturally oxidised to form carbon dioxide and water
Â (CH₄ + 2 O₂ Â â†’Â Â CO₂ + 2 H₂O)

-   This is why methane levels in the atmosphere are not very large,
    even though significant quantities are being produced Â

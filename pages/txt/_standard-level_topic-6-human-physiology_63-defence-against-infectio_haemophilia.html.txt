Haemophilia

Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive condition that impairs the bodyâ€™s
ability to control blood clotting

-   It is more common in males than females (as males areÂ hemizygous
    and have only one X chromosome)

People with haemophilia (haemophiliacs) have lower levels of functional
clotting factors in their blood plasma

-   This means the normal coagulation cascade is impaired and fibrin
    formation does not occur
-   Thus while a temporary scab may form (due to the formation of a
    platelet plug), a lasting blood clot cannot form

Haemophiliacs can die from minor injuries, as the continued loss of
blood flow cannot be prevented via clot formation

-   There are different types of haemophilia with varying severities,
    depending on which specific clotting factor is defective
-   Haemophilia A (clotting factor XIII deficiency) is more common than
    haemophilia B (clotting factor IX deficiency)

Types of Metabolism

All living things undergo metabolism and may be classified according to
three key conditions:

-   The method by which they obtain their carbon
-   The method by which they derive their energy
-   The method by which they generate reducing equivalents

1. Â Carbon Source

Organisms can obtain carbon for synthesising organic molecules by own of
three means:

-   Autotrophic â€“ Carbon is obtained from inorganic compounds (e.g.
    CO₂)
-   Heterotrophic â€“ Carbon is obtained from organic compounds (e.g.
    sugars)
-   Mixotrophic â€“ Carbon may be obtained from either inorganic or
    organic sources

2. Â Energy Source

Organisms can derive the energy they need for living and growing by one
of two means:

-   Phototrophic â€“ The energy is obtained from sunlight
-   Chemotrophic â€“ The energy is obtained from externally derived
    chemical compoundsÂ 

3. Â Reducing Equivalents

Reducing equivalents are chemical species that can transfer electrons
needed for energy conversions and biosynthesis

Organisms can obtain reducing equivalents from one of two sources:

-   Lithotrophic â€“ Electrons are derived from inorganic compounds
    (e.g. H₂, NH₃, CO, H₂S, SO₄²⁻, Fe)
-   Organotrophic â€“ Electrons are derived from organic compounds (e.g.
    carbohydrates, proteins, lipids)

These terms can be combined to describe the organism â€“ e.g.
photolithoautotrophs (plants), chemoorganoheterotrophs (animals)

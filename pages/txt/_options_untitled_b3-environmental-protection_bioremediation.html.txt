Understanding:

â€¢ Â Responses to pollution incidents can involve bioremediation
combined with physical and chemical procedures

â€¢ Â Microorganisms are used in bioremediation

Â  Â Â 
Pollution involves the release of harmful contaminants into the natural
environment, causing ecological disruption

-   Responses to pollution incidents can involve bioremediation combined
    with physical and chemical procedures

Bioremediation is the process by whichÂ microorganisms are used to
return a polluted environment to its natural state

-   Microorganisms may produce specific enzymes and undergo certain
    chemical processes that can break down contaminants

Bioremediation is often supported by physical and chemical procedures
that help filter the contaminant out of the environment

-   Physical: Â Detergents and dispersal agents may be deployed on oil
    spills to prevent the contaminants from aggregating
-   Chemical: Â Contaminants can alternatively be burnt, removed by
    dissolving or destroyed by chemical oxidation

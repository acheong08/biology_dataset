Understanding:

â€¢ Â The various specific forms of a gene are alleles

â€¢ Â Alleles differ from each other by one or only a few bases

Â  Â Â 
Alleles are alternative forms of a gene that code for the different
variations of a specific trait

-   For example, the gene for eye colour has alleles that encode
    different shades / pigments

As alleles are alternative forms of the one gene, they possess very
similar gene sequences

-   Alleles only differ from each other by one or a few bases

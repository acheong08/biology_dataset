Examples of GMOs

GMOs (genetically modified organisms) have been artificially manipulated
through genetic engineering to express new traits

There are a number of possible applications for the genetic modification
of organisms:

-   Agricultural crops are commonly modified to improve yield, growth
    rates and nutritional value
-   Genetically modified animals may be used to grow human transplant
    tissues and organs (xenotransplantation)
-   A number of microorganisms are being considered as future clean fuel
    producers andÂ biodegraders
-   Pharmaceutical companies are exploring the possibilities of
    introducing vaccines, antibodies and medicines into foods

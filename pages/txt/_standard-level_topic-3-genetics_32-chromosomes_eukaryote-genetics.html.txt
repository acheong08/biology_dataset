Understanding:

â€¢ Â Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear DNA molecules associated with
histone proteins

Â  Â Â 
The genetic material of eukaryotic cells consist of multiple linear
molecules of DNA that are associated with histone proteins

-   The packaging of DNA with histone proteins results in a greatly
    compacted structure, allowing for more efficient storage Â 

Organisation of eukaryotic chromosomes can be summarised as follows:

-   DNA is complexed with eight histone proteins (an octamer) to form a
    complex called a nucleosome
-   Nucleosomes are linked by an additional histone protein (H1 histone)
    to form a string of chromatosomes
-   These then coil to form a solenoid structure (~6 chromatosomes per
    turn) which is condensed to form a 30 nm fibre
-   These fibres then form loops, which are compressed and folded around
    a protein scaffold to form chromatin
-   Chromatin will then supercoil during cell division to form
    chromosomes that are visible (when stained) under microscope

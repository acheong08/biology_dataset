Understanding:

â€¢ Â Skeletal muscle fibres are multinucleate and contain specialised
endoplasmic reticulum

â€¢ Â Muscle fibres contain many myofibrils

Organisation of Skeletal Muscles

-   Skeletal muscles consist of tightly packaged muscular bundles
    (fascicles) surrounded by connective tissue (perimysium)
-   Each bundle contains multiple muscle fibres, which are formed when
    individual muscle cells fuse together
-   Muscle fibres contain tubular myofibrils that run the length of the
    fibre and are responsible for muscular contraction
-   The myofibrils can be divided into repeating sections called
    sarcomeres, each of which represent a single contractile unitÂ

Muscle Fibre Structure

Each individual muscle fibre has the following specialised features
designed to facilitate muscle contraction:

-   They areÂ multinucleate (fibres form from the fusion of individual
    muscle cells and hence have many nuclei)
-   They have a large number of mitochondria (muscle contraction
    requires ATP hydrolysis)
-   They have a specialised endoplasmic reticulum (it is called the
    sarcoplasmic reticulum and stores calcium ions)
-   They contain tubular myofibrils made up of two different
    myofilaments â€“ thin filament (actin) and thick filament (myosin)
-   The continuous membrane surrounding the muscle fibre is called the
    sarcolemma and contains invaginations called T tubules

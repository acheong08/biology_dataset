Animal Survival

There are a number of limiting factors that affect the distribution of
animal species within a community

-   These include temperature, territory for feeding and breeding, water
    access and food supply

Temperature

-   Animal survival typically relies on a narrow temperature range â€“
    few animals can survive temperature extremes
-   Poikilotherms cannot maintain thermal homeostasis and must occupy
    environments according to temperature needs
-   Homeotherms can regulate their own internal body temperatures and
    hence can occupy a wider range of habitats
-   Body size will play a fundamental role in determining an animalâ€™s
    capacity to retain heat (i.e. SA:Vol ratio)

Territory

-   Territorial boundaries may determine an animals capacity to attract
    mates, rear young, forage for food and avoid predators
-   Territories may be temporary (e.g. migration / breeding sites) or
    alternatively may be permanent
-   In certain species, juveniles may have different environmental
    requirements to adults (e.g. tadpoles and frogs)
-   Establishment of territories can lead to intraspecific and
    interspecific competition

Food Availability

-   Availability of a food supply is a critical determinant in
    influencing population size and distribution
-   Animals may require a particular plant or animal species as a food
    source â€“ limiting their spread to certain regionsÂ 
-   Seasonal or geographic variations may directly affect food
    availability within a population (e.g. seasonal migrations)

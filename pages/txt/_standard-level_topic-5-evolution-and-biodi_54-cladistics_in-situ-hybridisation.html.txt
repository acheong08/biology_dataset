In Situ Hybridisation

Molecular evidence for phylogenetic relationships involves identifying
conservation in DNA or amino acid sequences

One technique used to identify conservation in gene sequences is DNA â€“
DNA hybridisation

-   DNA is double stranded and is held together by hydrogen bonds
    between complementary base pairs
-   DNA from different species can be separated into single strands with
    sufficient heat and then mixed together
-   If two strands from different species share similar sequences they
    will hybridise (anneal together to form a double strand)
-   The amount of heat then required to separate this hybrid molecule
    indicates how similar the two sequences are
-   More heat indicates more hydrogen bonds formed, meaning more
    complementary base pairing due to similar sequences
-   Less heat indicates fewer hydrogen bonds formed, meaning less base
    pairing has occurred because sequences are dissimilar

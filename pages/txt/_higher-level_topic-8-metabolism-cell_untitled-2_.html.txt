8.3 Â Photosynthesis

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Light energy is converted
into chemical energy

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Light-dependent reactions take place in the intermembrane space of
    the thylakoids
-   Light-independent reactions take place in theÂ stroma
-   Reduced NADP and ATP are produced in the light-dependent reactions
-   Absorption of light by photosystems generates excited electrons
-   Photolysis of water generates electrons for use in the
    light-dependent reactions
-   Transfer of excited electrons occurs between carriers in thylakoid
    membranes
-   Excited electrons from Photosystem II are used to contribute to
    generate a proton gradient
-   ATP synthase inÂ thylakoids generates ATP using the proton gradient
-   Excited electrons from Photosystem I are used to reduce NADP
-   In the light-independent reactions a carboxylase catalyses the
    carboxylation of ribulose bisphosphate
-   Glycerate-3-phosphate is reduced to triose phosphate using reduced
    NADP and ATP
-   Triose phosphate is used to regenerate RuBP and produce
    carbohydrates
-   Ribulose bisphosphate is reformed using ATP
-   The structure of the chloroplast is adapted to its function in
    photosynthesis

Application:

-   Calvinâ€™s experiment to elucidate the carboxylation of RuBP

Skill:

-   Annotation of a diagram to indicate the adaptations of a chloroplast
    to its function

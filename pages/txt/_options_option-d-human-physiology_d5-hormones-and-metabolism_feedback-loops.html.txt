Feedback Loops

Physiological processes are commonly moderated via two distinct feedback
mechanisms â€“positive and negative feedback

-   Homeostatic processes are controlled byÂ negative feedbackÂ and
    hence these systems occur more commonly within the body

Negative Feedback

Negative feedback involves a response that is theÂ reverseÂ of the
change detected (it functions toÂ reduceÂ the change)

-   A change is detected by a receptor and an effector is activated to
    induce an opposite effect â€“ this promotes equilibrium

Examples of processes that utilise negative feedback loops include
homeostatic systems, such as:

-   Thermoregulation (if body temperature changes, mechanisms are
    induced to restore normal levels)
-   Blood sugar regulation (insulin lowers blood glucose when levels are
    high ; glucagon raises blood glucose when levels are low)
-   Osmoregulation (ADH is secreted to retain water when dehydrated and
    its release is inhibited when the body is hydrated)

Positive Feedback

Positive feedback involves a response thatÂ reinforcesÂ the change
detected (it functions toÂ amplifyÂ the change)

-   A change is detected by a receptor and an effector is activated to
    induce the same effect â€“ this promotes further change
-   Positive feedback loops will continue to amplify the initial change
    until the stimulus is removed

Examples of processes that utilise positive feedback loops include:

-   Childbirth â€“ stretching of uterine walls cause contractions that
    further stretch the walls (this continues until birthing occurs)
-   Lactation â€“ the child feeding stimulates milk production which
    causes further feeding (continues until baby stops feeding)
-   Ovulation â€“ the dominant follicle releasesÂ oestrogen which
    stimulates LH and FSH release to promote further follicular growth
-   Blood clotting â€“ platelets release clotting factors which cause
    more platelets to aggregate at the site of injury

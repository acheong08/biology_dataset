Understanding:

â€¢ Â Evolution occurs when heritable characteristics of a species
change

Â  Â Â 
Evolution at its most fundamental level simply describes a change over
time

-   In living organisms this change refers to the heritable
    characteristics of a species (biological evolution)

Heritable characteristics are encoded for by genes and may be
transferred between generations as allelesÂ 

-   Hence biological evolution describes cumulative changes that occur
    within aÂ populationÂ between one generation and the next

A concise definition for biological evolution is:

-   A change in the allele frequency of a populationâ€™s gene pool over
    successive generations

Evolution = Change Over Time

[change over time]

Stem Tissue

Below is a microscopic cross-section of a typical stem (taken from a
dicotyledonous plant)

-   Distribution of tissues may differ between plant types (e.g.
    vascular bundles are scattered in monocotyledons)

Key Features:

-   The epidermis covers the outer surface and functions to waterproof,
    protect the stem and control gas exchange
-   The ground tissue (cortex and pith) is found internally and assist
    in the transport and storage of materials within the stem
-   The cambium is a centrally located, circular layer of
    undifferentiated cells responsible for lateral growth of the stem
-   Vascular bundles are arranged in bundles near the outer edge of the
    stem to resist compression and bending
    -   The xylem is located to the interior side of the bundle and the
        phloem is on the exterior side (phloem = outside)

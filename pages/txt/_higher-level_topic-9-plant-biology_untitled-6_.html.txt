9.1 Â Transport in the Xylem of Plants

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Structure and function are Â 
correlated in the xylem of plants

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Transpiration is the inevitable consequence of gas exchange in the
    leaf
-   Plants transport water from the roots to the leaves to replace
    losses from transpiration
-   The cohesive property of water and the structure of the xylem
    vessels allow transport under tension
-   The adhesive property of water and evaporation generate tension
    forces in leaf cell walls
-   Active uptake of mineral ions in the roots causes absorption of
    water by osmosis

Applications:

-   Adaptations of plants in deserts and in saline soils for water
    conservation
-   Models of water transport in xylem using simple apparatus including
    blotting or filter paper, porous pots and capillary tubing

Skills:

-   Drawing the structure of primary xylem vessels in sections of stems
    based on microscope images
-   Measurement of transpiration rates usingÂ potometers
-   Design of an experiment to test hypotheses about the effect of
    temperature or humidity on transpiration rates

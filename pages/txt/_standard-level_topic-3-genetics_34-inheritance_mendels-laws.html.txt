Understanding:

â€¢ Â Mendel discovered the principles of inheritance with experiments
in which a large numberÂ of pea plants

Â  Â were crossed

Â  Â Â 
Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk who developed the principles of
inheritance by performing experiments on pea plants

-   First, he crossed different varieties of purebred pea plants, then
    collected and grew the seeds to determine their characteristics
-   Next, he crossed the offspring with each other (self-fertilization)
    and grew their seeds to similarly determine their characteristics
-   These crosses were performed many times to establish reliable data
    trends (over 5,000 crosses were performed)

As a result of these experiments, Mendel discovered the following
things:

1.  When he crossed two different purebred varieties together the
    results were not a blendÂ â€“ only one feature would be expressed
    -   E.g. When purebred tall and short pea plants were crossed, all
        offspring developed into tall growing plants
2.  When Mendel self-fertilised the offspring, the resulting progeny
    expressed the two different traits in a ratio of ~ 3:1
    -   E.g. When the tall growing progeny were crossed, tall and short
        pea plants were produced in a ratio of ~ 3:1Â 

From these findings, Mendel drew the following conclusions:

-   Organisms have discrete factors that determine its features
    (theseÂ â€˜factorsâ€™Â are now recognised as genes)
-   Furthermore, organisms possess two versions of each factor
    (theseÂ â€˜versionsâ€™Â are now recognised as alleles)
-   Each gamete contains only one version of each factor (sex cells are
    now recognised to be haploid)
-   Parents contribute equally to the inheritance of offspring as a
    result of the fusion between randomly selected egg and sperm
-   For each factor, one version is dominant over another and will be
    completely expressed if present

While there are caveats to Mendelâ€™s conclusions, certain rules can be
established:

1.  Law of Segregation: When gametes form, alleles are separated so that
    each gamete carries only one allele for each gene
2.  Law of Independent Assortment: The segregation of alleles for one
    gene occurs independently to that of any other gene*
3.  Principle of Dominance: Recessive alleles will be masked by dominant
    alleles^(â€ )

* Â The law of independent assortment does not hold true for genes
located on the same chromosome (i.e. linked genes)
^(â€ )Â  Not all genes show a complete dominance hierarchy â€“ some
genes show co-dominance or incomplete dominance

Photosynthesis vs Respiration

In many respects, photosynthesis and cell respiration are complementary
reactions within the environment

-   The products of photosynthesis function as the inputs of cell
    respiration (oxygen and glucose)
-   The products of cell respiration function as the inputs of
    photosynthesis (carbon dioxide and water)

Most producers (i.e. photoautotrophs) undertake both photosynthesis and
cell respiration to survive

-   Consumers (i.e. heterotrophs) only undertake cell respiration, but
    will ingest or absorb photosynthetic products

Interrelationship Between Processes

Similarities

Photosynthesis and cell respiration both involve the production of
chemical energy (ATP)

-   In photosynthesis, ATP is produced via light energy
    (photophosphorylation) and used to make organic molecules
-   In cellÂ respiration, ATP is produced by breaking down organic
    molecules (oxidative phosphorylation)

In both cases, the production of ATP involves an electron transport
chain and chemiosmosis

-   In photosynthesis, electrons are donated by chlorophyll and protons
    accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoid
-   In cell respiration, electrons are donated by hydrogen carriers and
    protons accumulate in the intermembrane space

Differences

Photosynthesis and cell respiration are in many respects the reverse of
one another

-   Photosynthesis is an anabolic process, whereas cell respiration is a
    catabolic process

Photosynthesis:

-   Water is broken down to oxygen to release electrons for an electron
    transport chain
-   Electrons from the transport chain are taken up by hydrogen carriers
    (NADPH specifically)
-   Uses the Calvin cycle to synthesise glucose (requires hydrogen
    carriers and carbon dioxide)

Cell Respiration:

-   Uses the Krebs cycle to break down glucose (releases hydrogen
    carriers and carbon dioxide
-   Hydrogen carriers release electrons for an electron transport chain
    (NADH and FADH₂ specifically)
-   Electrons from the transport chain are taken up by oxygen (to form
    water)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Air is carried to the lungs in the trachea and bronchi and then to
the alveoli in bronchioles

Â  Â Â 
The Respiratory System

-   Air enters the respiratory system through the nose or mouth and
    passes through the pharynx to the trachea
-   The air travels down the trachea until it divides into two bronchi
    (singular: bronchus) which connect to the lungs
-   The right lung is composed of three lobes, while the left lung is
    only comprised of two (smaller due to position of heart)
-   Inside each lung, the bronchi divide into many smaller airways
    called bronchioles, greatly increasing surface area
-   Each bronchiole terminates with a cluster of air sacs called
    alveoli, where gas exchange with the bloodstream occurs

Structure of an Alveolus

Alveoli function as the site of gas exchange, and hence have specialised
structural features to help fulfil this role:

-   They have a very thin epithelial layer (one cell thick) to minimise
    diffusion distances for respiratory gases
-   They are surrounded by a rich capillary network to increase the
    capacity for gas exchange with the blood
-   They are roughly spherical in shape, in order to maximise the
    available surface area for gas exchange
-   Their internal surface is covered with a layer of fluid, as
    dissolved gases are better able to diffuse into the bloodstream

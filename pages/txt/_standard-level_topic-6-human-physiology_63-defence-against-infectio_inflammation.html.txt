Inflammation

The inflammatory response is the non-specific way in which the body
responds when a pathogen damages body tissue

-   When tissue damage occurs, mast cells (localised) and basophils
    (circulating) release a chemical called histamine
-   Histamine causes local vasodilation and increases capillary
    permeability to improve the recruitment of leukocytes to the region
-   Damaged cells also release chemotactic factors which attract
    leukocytes to the site of infection
-   While inflammation is necessary to allow immune cells access to
    damaged tissue, there are unavoidable side effects
-   Increased blood flow causes redness and heat, while increased
    permeability releases fluids and causes swelling and tenderness
-   Inflammation can be either short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic)

Fever

A fever is an abnormally high temperature associated with infection and
is triggered by the release of prostaglandins

-   Fever may help to combat infection by reducing the growth rate of
    microbes (via the inactivation of microbial enzymes)
-   It may also increase metabolic activity in body cells and activate
    heat shock proteins to strengthen the immune response

A fever occurs when activated leukocytes release pro-inflammatory
chemicals called cytokines

-   Cytokines stimulate the anterior hypothalamus to produce
    prostaglandins, which lead to an increase in body temperature
-   Up to a certain point a fever may be beneficial, butÂ beyond a
    tolerable limit it can cause damage to the bodyâ€™s own enzymes

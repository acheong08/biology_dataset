Flowers are the reproductive organs of angiospermophytes (flowering
plants) and contain male and female structures

-   Most flowers possess both male and female structures (monoecious),
    but some may only possess one structure (dioecious)

Flower Structures

The male part of the flower is called the stamen and is composed of:

-   Anther â€“ pollen producing organ of the flower (pollen is the male
    gamete of a flowering plant)
-   Filament â€“ slender stalk supporting the anther (makes the anther
    accessible to pollinators)

The female part of the flower is called the pistil (or carpel) and is
composed of:

-   Stigma â€“ the sticky, receptive tip of the pistil that is
    responsible for catching the pollen
-   Style â€“ the tube-shaped connection between the stigma and ovule
    (it elevates the stigma to help catch pollen)
-   Ovule â€“ the structure that contains the female reproductive cells
    (after fertilisation, it will develop into a seed)

In addition to these reproductive structures, flowers possess a number
of other support structures:

-   Petals â€“ brightly coloured modified leaves, which function to
    attract pollinators
-   Sepal â€“ Outer covering which protects the flower when in bud
-   Peduncle â€“ Stalk of the flower

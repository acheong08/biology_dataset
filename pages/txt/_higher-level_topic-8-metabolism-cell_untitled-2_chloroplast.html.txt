Understanding:

â€¢ Â The structure of the chloroplast is adapted to its function in
photosynthesis

Â  Â 
Chloroplasts are theÂ â€™solar energy plantsâ€™Â of a cell â€“ they
convert light energy into chemical energy

-   This chemical energy may be either ATP (light dependent) or organic
    compounds (light independent)
-   Only photosynthetic tissue possess chloroplasts (e.g. is present in
    leaves but not roots of plants)

Chloroplasts are thought to have once been independent prokaryotes that
were internalised by eukaryotes via endosymbiosis

-   They have a double membrane structure (due to vesicular coating as
    part of the endocytotic process)
-   They have their own DNA (circular and naked) and ribosomes (70S)
-   Their metabolic processes are susceptible to certain antibiotics

The structure of the chloroplast is adapted to the function it performs:

-   Thylakoids â€“ flattened discs have a small internal volume to
    maximise hydrogen gradient upon proton accumulationÂ 
-   GranaÂ â€“ thylakoids are arranged into stacks to increase SA:Vol
    ratio of the thylakoid membrane
-   PhotosystemsÂ â€“ pigments organised into photosystems in thylakoid
    membrane to maximise light absorption
-   StromaÂ â€“ central cavity that contains appropriate enzymes and a
    suitable pH for the Calvin cycle to occur
-   Lamellae â€“ connects and separates thylakoid stacks (grana),
    maximising photosynthetic efficiency

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram to indicate the adaptations of a
chloroplast to its function

Â  Â 
ElectronÂ micrographs of a chloroplast may differ in appearance
depending on where the cross-section occurs

Typically, chloroplast diagrams should display the following features:

-   Usually round in appearance with a double membrane exterior
-   Flattened discs (thylakoids) arranged into stacks (grana), connected
    by lamellae
-   Internal lumen of thylakoids is very small (allows for a more rapid
    generation of a proton motive force)
-   Ribosomes and chloroplast DNA are usuallyÂ notÂ visible at standard
    resolutions and magnifications
-   Starch granules may be visible and will appear as dark spots within
    the chloroplast

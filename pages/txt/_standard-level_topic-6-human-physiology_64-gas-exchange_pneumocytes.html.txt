Understanding:

â€¢ Â Type I pneumocytes are extremely thin alveolar cells that are
adapted to carry out gas exchange

Â  Â Â 
Pneumocytes (or alveolar cells) are the cells that line the alveoli and
comprise of the majority of the inner surface of the lungs

-   There are two types of alveolar cells â€“ type I pneumocytes and
    type II pneumocytes

Type I pneumocytes

-   Type I pneumocytes are involved in the process of gas exchange
    between the alveoli and the capillaries
-   They are squamous (flattened) in shape and extremely thin (~
    0.15Âµm) â€“ minimising diffusion distance for respiratory gases
-   Type I pneumocytes are connected by occluding junctions, which
    prevents the leakage of tissue fluid into the alveolar air space
-   Type I pneumocytes are amitotic and unable to replicate, however
    type II cells can differentiate into type I cells if required

Type II pneumocytes

-   Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the secretion of pulmonary
    surfactant, which reduces surface tension in the alveoli
-   They are cuboidal in shape and possess many granules (for storing
    surfactant components)
-   Type II pneumocytes only comprise a fraction of the alveolar surface
    (~5%) but are relatively numerous (~60% of total cells)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Type II pneumocytes secrete a solution containing surfactant that
creates a moist surface inside the alveoli to

Â  Â Â prevent the sides of the alveolus adhering to each other by
reducing surface tension

Â  Â Â 
Alveoli are lined by a layer of liquid in order to create a moist
surface conducive to gas exchange with the capillaries

-   It is easier for oxygen to diffuse across the alveolar and capillary
    membranes when dissolved in liquid

While this moist lining assists with gas exchange, it also creates a
tendency for the alveoli to collapse and resist inflation

-   Surface tension is the elastic force created by a fluid surface that
    minimises the surface area (via cohesion of liquid molecules)

Type II pneumocytes secrete a liquid known as pulmonary surfactant which
reduces the surface tension in alveoli

-   As an alveoli expands with gas intake, the surfactant becomes more
    spread out across the moist alveolar lining
-   This increases surface tension and slows the rate of expansion,
    ensuring all alveoli inflate at roughly the same rate

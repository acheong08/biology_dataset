Osmoregulation is the third of three processes by which blood is
filtered and urine is formed

-   Osmoregulation is the control of the water balance of the blood,
    tissue or cytoplasm of a living organism

Osmoregulation occurs in the medulla of the kidney and involves two key
events:

-   The loop of Henle establishes a salt gradient (hypertonicity) in the
    medulla
-   Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) regulates the level of water
    reabsorption in the collecting duct

Establishing a Salt Gradient

-   The function of the loop of Henle is to create a high solute
    (hypertonic) concentration in the tissue fluid of the medulla
-   The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water but
    not salts
-   The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to salts but
    not water
-   This means that as the loop descends into the medulla, the
    interstitial fluid becomes more salty and hypertonic
-   Additionally, the vasa recta blood network that surrounds the loop
    of Henle flows in the opposite direction (counter-current)
-   This means that salts released from the ascending limb are drawn
    down into the medulla, further establishing a salt gradient

Understanding:

â€¢ Â ADH controls reabsorption of water in the collecting duct

Â  Â Â 
Water Reabsorption

-   As the collecting duct passes through the medulla, the hypertonic
    conditions of the medulla will draw water out by osmosis
-   The amount of water released from the collecting ducts to be
    retained by the body is controlled by anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)
-   ADH is released from the posterior pituitary in response to
    dehydration (detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus)
-   ADH increases the permeability of the collecting duct to water, by
    upregulating production of aquaporins (water channels)
-   This means less water remains in the filtrate, urine becomes
    concentrated and the individual urinates less (i.e. anti-diuresis)
-   When an individual is suitably hydrated, ADH levels decrease and
    less water is reabsorbed (resulting in more dilute urine)
    -   Remember: Â ADH is produced when you Are DeHydrated

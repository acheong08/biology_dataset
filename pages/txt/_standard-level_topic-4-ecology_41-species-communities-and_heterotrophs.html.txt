Understanding:

â€¢ Â Consumers are heterotrophs that feed on living organisms by
ingestion

Â  Â Â 
Heterotrophs obtain organic molecules from other organisms via different
feeding mechanisms and different food sources

-   Consequently, heterotrophs can be differentially classified
    according to their feeding pattern

Consumers

Consumers are heterotrophs that feed on living organisms by ingestion

-   Herbivores are consumers that feed principally on plant matter (e.g.
    cows, sheep, rabbits)
-   Carnivores are consumers that feed principally on animal matter
    (e.g. crocodiles, wolves, tigers)
-   Omnivores are consumers that have a principle diet composed of both
    plant and animal matter (e.g. pandas, humans)

Scavengers

Scavengers are a type of consumer that principally feed on dead and
decaying carcasses rather than hunting live prey

-   Examples of scavengers include hyenas, vultures and carrion birds
    (such as crows)

â€¢ Â Detritivores are heterotrophs that obtain organic nutrients from
detritus via internal digestion

Â  Â Â 
Detritivores

Detritivores are a type of heterotroph that obtains nutrients from
non-living organic sources, such as detritus and humus

-   Detritus is dead, particulate organic matter â€“ such as decaying
    organic material and fecal matter
-   Humus is the term given specifically to the decaying leaf litter
    intermixed within the topsoil
-   Detritivores include dung beetles, earthworms, woodlice, snails and
    crabs

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Saprotrophs are heterotrophs that obtain organic nutrients from
dead organisms by external digestion

Â  Â Â 
Saprotrophs

Saprotrophs live on (or in) non-living organic matter, secrete digestive
enzymes into it and absorbing the products of digestion

-   Unlike other types of heterotrophs, saprotrophs do not ingest food
    but use enzymatic secretion to facilitate external digestion
-   Because saprotrophs facilitate the breakdown of dead organic
    material, they are commonly referred to as decomposers
-   Examples of saprotrophs include bacteria and fungi

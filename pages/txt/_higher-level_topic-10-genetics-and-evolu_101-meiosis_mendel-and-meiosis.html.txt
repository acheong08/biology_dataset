Mendel and Meiosis

Gregor Mendel was a 19th century Moravian monk who demonstrated that the
inheritance of traits (i.e. genes) follow particular laws:

-   Law of Segregation: Â Each hereditary characteristic is controlled
    by two alleles which separate into different gametes
-   Law of Independent Assortment: Â The separation of alleles for one
    gene is independent to allele separation for another gene
-   Principle of Dominance: Â In pairs of alleles that are different,
    one allele will mask the effect of the other allele

TheseÂ â€˜lawsâ€™Â are now known to be due to key events that occur
during meiotic division:

-   The law of segregation describes how homologous chromosomes (and
    hence allele pairs) are separated in meiosis I
-   The law of independent assortment describes how homologous pairs
    align randomly (as bivalents) during metaphase I

Through the elucidation of the process of meiosis, we now know that
there are certain exceptions to Mendelâ€™s laws:

-   Genes that are on the same chromosome (linked genes) will not
    undergo independent assortment (unless recombination occurs)
-   Not all genes display a dominance hierarchy â€“ certain traits may
    display codominance or incomplete dominance

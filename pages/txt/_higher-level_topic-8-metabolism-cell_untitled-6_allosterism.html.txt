Allosterism

Allosteric regulation (allosterism) is the modulation of an enzymeâ€™s
activity via the binding of an effector molecule (ligand) to a site
other than the enzymeâ€™s active site (an allosteric site)

-   Allosteric binding causes a conformational change in the enzymeâ€™s
    structure which affects the enzymeâ€™s affinity for substrate
-   Allosteric regulation can be either positive (activation) or
    negative (non-competitive inhibition)

Positive Allosterism

-   An example of allosteric activation is seen in the binding of oxygen
    molecules to haemoglobin
-   Haemoglobin is composed of four distinct subunits and can bind up to
    four oxygen molecules (HbO₈)
-   As each oxygen molecule binds, it changes the conformation of
    haemoglobin and increases its affinity for oxygen
-   This ensures that haemoglobin will transport the maximum amount of
    oxygen from oxygen-rich areas (i.e. the lungs)
-   Conversely, the release of an O₂ molecule decreases haemoglobinâ€™s
    affinity for oxygen â€“ promoting its release in the tissues

Negative Allosterism

-   An example of allosteric inhibition can be seen in any example of
    non-competitive inhibition
-   Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of
    glucose during glycolysis (to make ATP)
-   ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK and inhibits its activity â€“
    preventing glycolysis from occurring
-   Thus ATP prevents the further production of more ATP when energy
    stocks are high (end-product inhibition)
-   When energy stocks are low, there is insufficient ATP to inhibit PFK
    and glycolysis will be able to proceed

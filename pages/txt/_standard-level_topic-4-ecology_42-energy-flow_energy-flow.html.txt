Understanding:

â€¢ Â Chemical energy in carbon compounds flows through food chains by
means of feeding

Â  Â Â 
Energy enters most ecosystems as sunlight, where it is converted into
chemical energy by producers (via photosynthesis)

-   This chemical energy is stored in carbon compounds (organic
    molecules) and is transferred to heterotrophs via feeding

Trophic Levels

The position an organism occupies within a feeding sequence is known as
a trophic level

-   Producers always occupy the first trophic level in a feeding
    sequence
-   Primary consumers feed on producers and hence occupy the second
    trophic level
-   Further consumers (e.g. secondary, tertiary, etc.) may occupy
    subsequent trophic levels

The trophic levels in a community are:

Food Chains

A food chain shows the linear feeding relationships between species in a
community

-   Arrows represent the transfer of energy and matter as one organism
    is eaten by another (arrows point in direction of energy flow)
-   The first organism in a food chain is always a producer, followed by
    consumers (primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.)

â€¢ Â Annotation of diagrams of the nephron

Â  Â Â 
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, with each nephron
being comprised of the following components:

-   Bowmanâ€™s capsule â€“ first part of the nephron where blood is
    initially filtered (to form filtrate)
-   Proximal convoluted tubule â€“ folded structure connected to the
    Bowmanâ€™s capsule where selective reabsorption occurs
-   Loop of Henle â€“ a selectively permeable loop that descends into
    the medulla and establishes a salt gradient
-   Distal convoluted tubule â€“ a folded structure connected to the
    loop of Henle where further selective reabsorption occurs

The blood to be filtered enters the Bowmanâ€™s capsule via an afferent
arteriole and leaves the capsule via an efferent arteriole

-   Within the Bowmanâ€™s capsule, the blood is filtered at a capillary
    tuft called the glomerulus
-   The efferent arteriole forms a blood network called the vasa recta
    that reabsorbs components of the filtrate from the nephron

Each nephron connects to a collecting duct (via the distal convoluted
tubule), which feed into the renal pelvis

-   The collecting ducts are shared by nephrons and hence are not
    technically considered to be part of a single nephron

Nephron Function

Nephrons filter blood and then reabsorb useful materials from the
filtrate before eliminating the remainder as urine

This process occurs over three key stages:

1.  Ultrafiltration â€“ Blood is filtered out of the glomerulus at the
    Bowmanâ€™s capsule to form filtrate
2.  Selective reabsorption â€“ Usable materials are reabsorbed in
    convoluted tubules (both proximal and distal)
3.  Osmoregulation â€“ The loop of Henle establishes a salt gradient,
    which draws water out of the collecting duct

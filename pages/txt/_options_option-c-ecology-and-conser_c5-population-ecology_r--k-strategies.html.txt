r / K Strategies

The terms r-selection and K-selection are used by ecologists to describe
the growth and reproduction strategies of organisms

-   r-selected species have a high growth rate but low survivability
    (â€œcheapâ€? offspring)
-   K-selected species have a low growth rate but high survivability
    (â€œexpensiveâ€? offspring)

r-selection

-   Occurs in unstable environments where there are ecological
    disruptions and resources are used for maximising reproduction
-   There are usually many offspring per brood, which require little
    parental care and have a high rate of mortality
-   The body size of offspring is typically small and they have an early
    onset of maturity (short developmental span)
-   Population size is typically variable (highly fluctuating) and an
    example of a r-selected organism is a pioneer species

K-selection

-   Predominates in stable or predictable environments where resources
    are used for maximising long-term survival
-   There are usually very few offspring per brood, each requiring high
    levels of parental care (resulting in low mortality)
-   The body size of offspring is typically larger and they have a late
    onset of maturity (long developmental span)
-   Population size is typically stable (reaches carrying capacity) and
    an example of K-selection is a climax species

It can be difficult to determine if a species is following a r-strategy
or a K-strategy as they represent two ends of an extreme

-   In reality, most organisms typically demonstrate an intermediate
    strategy somewhere along the spectrum (e.g. type II growth)
-   Some species may even change their selection strategy according to
    environmental conditions

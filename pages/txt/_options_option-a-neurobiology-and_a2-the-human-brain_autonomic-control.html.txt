Understanding:

â€¢ Â The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes in the
body using centres in the brainstem

Â  Â Â 
The human nervous system can be organised into several sub-divisions:

-   Firstly, the nervous system can be divided into the central nervous
    system (brain and spine) and peripheral nervous system
-   The peripheral nervous system (PNS) can be divided into the sensory
    (afferent) pathway or the motor (efferent) pathway
-   The motor pathway can be subdivided according to whether the
    response is voluntary (somatic) or involuntary (autonomic)

The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes in the body
using centres located mostly within the brainstem

-   Sympathetic nerves release noradrenaline (adrenergic) to mobilise
    body systems (â€˜fight or flightâ€™ responses)
-   Parasympathetic nerves release acetylcholine (cholinergic) to relax
    body systems and conserve energy (â€˜rest and digestâ€™)

Application:

â€¢ Â Swallowing, breathing and heart rate as examples of activities
coordinated by the medulla

Â  Â Â 
The medulla oblongata is a part of the brainstem responsible for
coordinating many autonomic (involuntary) activities

-   This includes the regulation of body activities such as swallowing,
    breathing and heart rate

Sympathetic ResponsesÂ Â (â€˜Fight or Flightâ€™)

-   Decreases salivary release and blood flow to the gut in response to
    swallowing
-   Increases ventilation rate and dilates airways in response to a
    reduction in blood pH (caused by increased levels of CO₂)
-   Increases heart rate by raising the normal sinus rhythm of the
    pacemaker of the heart

Parasympathetic Responses Â (â€˜Rest and Digestâ€™ /Â â€˜Feed and
Breedâ€™)

-   Increases salivary release and blood flow to the gut in response to
    swallowing
-   Lowers ventilation rate and constricts airways in response to an
    increase in blood pH (caused by lower levels of CO₂)
-   Reduces heart rate (via vagus nerve) by lowering the normal sinus
    rhythm of the pacemaker of the heart

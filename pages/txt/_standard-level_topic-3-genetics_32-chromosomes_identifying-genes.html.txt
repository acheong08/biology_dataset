Understanding:

â€¢ Â In a eukaryote species there are different chromosomes that carry
different genes

Â  Â Â 
Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear molecules of DNA that are compacted
during cell division (mitosis or meiosis)
Each chromosome has a constriction point called a centromere, which
divides the chromosome into two sections (orÂ â€˜armsâ€™)

-   The shorter section is designated the p arm and the longer section
    is designated the q arm

Eukaryotic species possess multiple chromosomes that may differ in both
their size and the position of their centromere

-   Staining chromosomes with particular dyes (e.g. Giemsa stain) will
    additionally generate unique banding patterns

Each chromosome will carry specific genes and the position of a
particular gene on a chromosome is called the locus
The region in which a locus is positioned can be identified via three
points of reference:

-   The first point of reference is a number (or letter) which denotes
    the chromosome (e.g. 7q31 refers to chromosome 7)Â 
-   The second point of reference is a letter (p or q) to denote which
    arm the locus is positioned on (e.g. 7q31 is on the q arm)
-   The third point of reference is a number corresponding to the G band
    location (e.g. 7q31 is at the longitudinal position 31)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of databases to identify the locus of a human gene and its
polypeptide product

Â  Â Â 
The locus of a human gene and its polypeptide product can both be
identified using a single online resource:

-   GenBankÂ â€“ a genetic database that serves as an annotated
    collection of DNA sequences

[genbank]

Identifying Gene Loci

GenBank can be used to identify the specific location of a gene on any
given chromosome

To identify a specific gene locus:

-   Change the search parameter from nucleotide to gene and type in the
    name of the gene of interest
-   Choose the species of interest (i.e. Homo sapiens) and click on the
    link (underÂ â€˜Name / Gene IDâ€™)
-   Scroll to theÂ â€˜Genomic contextâ€™Â section to determine the
    specific position of the gene locus
-   A visual profile can be generated by clicking onÂ â€˜Map
    Viewerâ€™Â link and looking at the Ideogram on the left side

Identifying Polypeptide Products:

GenBank can also be used to identify the polypeptide product of any
given gene

To identify the polypeptide product of a gene:

-   Change the search parameter from nucleotide to gene and type in the
    name of the gene of interest
-   Choose the species of interest (i.e.Â Homo sapiens) and click on the
    link (underÂ â€˜Name / Gene IDâ€™)
-   The polypeptide product should be identified within
    theÂ â€˜Summaryâ€™Â section

Below are examples of different genes that may be searched for:

-   HBBÂ Â â€“ Â Haemoglobin beta gene
-   DRD4Â Â â€“ Â Dopamine receptor D4 gene
-   F8Â Â â€“ Â Coagulation factor VIII gene
-   IGF1RÂ Â â€“ Â Insulin growth factor 1 receptor gene

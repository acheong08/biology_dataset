Understanding:

â€¢ Â Microorganisms are metabolically diverse

Â  Â Â 
Microorganisms may be differentiated according to their diverse
morphological and metabolic characteristics:

-   Microorganisms may differ in their cellularÂ organisation â€“ e.g.
    prokaryotes versus eukaryotes
-   Microorganisms may exhibit different nutritional requirements â€“
    e.g. autotrophic versus heterotrophic
-   Their method of respiration may vary according to type â€“ e.g.
    aerobic versus anaerobic respiration
-   They may have different structural characteristics â€“ e.g. shape or
    cell wall composition

Modes of Nutrition

Microorganisms can be categorised according to their mode of nutrition:

-   Photoautotrophs use light energy to synthesise organic molecules
    (e.g. cyanobacteria)
-   Chemoautrophs use energy from chemical oxidation to synthesise
    organic molecules (e.g. nitrogen-fixating bacteria)
-   Heterotrophs obtain organic nutrients via feeding (e.g. amoeba)
-   Saprotrophs release digestive enzymes onto non-living organic matter
    and absorb the products (e.g. fungi)

Methods of Respiration

Microorganisms can also be categorised according to their mechanism of
respiration:

-   Obligate anaerobes respire anaerobically and can only grow in the
    absence of oxygen
-   Aerotolerant anaerobes respire anaerobically but can grow in the
    presence of oxygen
-   Facultative anaerobes can respire anaerobically or aerobically
    depending on oxygen availability
-   Obligate aerobes only respire aerobically and cannot survive in the
    absence of oxygen

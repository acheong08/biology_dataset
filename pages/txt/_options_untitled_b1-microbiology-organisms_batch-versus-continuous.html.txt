Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fermentation is carried out by batch or continuous culture

Â  Â Â 
Batch Culture

-   Fermentation is carried out in a closed fermenter, with nothing
    added or removed during the process (except venting of gas)
-   Microorganisms and nutrients are left for a set period of time,
    during which the nutrient stock is depleted
-   The advantage of a batch culture is that the fermenter can be used
    for different reactions with each separate use
-   A disadvantage of a batch culture is that it results in significant
    periods of idle time between use, resulting in higher costs

Continuous Culture

-   Fermentation is carried out in an open fermenter, with nutrients
    added and product removed at a steady rate throughout
-   This results in a continuous reaction with no idle time, reducing
    labour costs and increasing product yields
-   A disadvantage of continuous culture is that there is a higher risk
    of contamination due to the constant adjustments
-   Continuous fermentation is feasible only when the inoculated cells
    are genetically stable

Application:

â€¢ Â Deep-tank batch fermentation in the mass production of penicillin

Â  Â Â 
The antibiotic penicillin can be mass produced via the use of deep-tank
batch fermentation

-   Large industrial fermenters are constructed that have the capacity
    to hold thousands of litres
-   Penicillium mold is grown in the deep-tank batch fermenters
    following the addition of sugars and other key ingredients
-   The production process typically lasts 6 â€“ 8 days, with the
    fermenter drained at the end of the fermentation cycle
-   Penicillin is separated from the solution and purified via
    downstream processing to improve its antibiotic potential

Application:

â€¢ Â Production of citric acid in continuous fermenters by Aspergillus
niger for use as a preservative or flavouring

Â  Â Â 
Citric acid (citrate) is widely used as a flavour enhancer, a
preservative in manufactured foods and an antioxidant

-   It is produced as an intermediate of the Krebs cycle under aerobic
    conditions

Citric acid is mass produced by continuous fermenter systems from
cultures of the fungus Aspergillus niger

-   Carbohydrates are continuously introduced into the fermenter in
    order to maintain the citric acid production
-   Iron (Fe²⁺ ions) is excluded from the mixture in order to slow the
    further conversion of citric acid within the Krebs cycle
-   As citric acid accumulates it is extracted as part of the medium
    that is being continuously withdrawn from the fermenter

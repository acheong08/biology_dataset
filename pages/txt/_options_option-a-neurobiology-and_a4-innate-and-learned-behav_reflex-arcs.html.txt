Understanding:

â€¢ Â Autonomic and involuntary responses are referred to as reflexes

â€¢ Â Reflex arcs comprise theÂ neurons that mediate reflexes

Â  Â Â 
The basic pathway for a nerve impulse is described by the stimulus
response model

-   AÂ stimulusÂ is a change in the environment (either external or
    internal) that is detected by a receptor
-   ReceptorsÂ transform the stimuli into nerve impulses thatÂ are
    transmitted to theÂ brainÂ where decision-making occurs
-   When a response is selected, the signal is transmitted viaÂ neurons
    to effectors, promoting a change in the organism

Some responses may be involuntary and occur without conscious thought
â€“ these actions are called reflexes

-   Reflex actions do not involve the brain â€“ instead sensory
    information is directly relayed to motor neurons within the spineÂ 
-   This results in a faster response, but one that does not involve
    conscious thought or deliberation

Application:

â€¢ Â Withdrawal reflex of the hand from a painful stimulus

Â  Â Â 
Reflex actions are particularly beneficial in survival situations, when
quick reactions are necessary to avoid permanent damage

-   Because reflex arcs donâ€™t involve the brain (only the spine and
    possibly brainstem), reflex actions are more rapid
-   Reflex responses also include autonomic actions such as
    modifications to heart rate, breathing and pupil accommodation

A common example of a reflex action is the patellar reflex (â€˜knee
jerkâ€™ response) that occurs when the patellar tendon is tapped

-   The patellar reflex is a common test employed by doctors to
    determine the presence of spinal lesions

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing and labelling a diagram of a reflex arc for a pain
withdrawal reflex

Â Â  Â Â 
In a pain withdrawal reflex arc:

-   A pain stimulus is detected by a receptor (nocireceptor) and a nerve
    impulse is initiated in a sensoryÂ neutron
-   The sensory neuron enters the spinal cord via the dorsal root and
    synapses with a relayÂ neuron in the grey matter
-   The relay neuron synapses with a motor neuron, which leaves the
    spinal cord via the ventral root
-   The motorÂ neuron synapses with a muscle (effector), causing it to
    contract and remove the limb from the pain stimulus

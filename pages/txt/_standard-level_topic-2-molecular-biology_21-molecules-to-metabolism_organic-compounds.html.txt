stable compounds to exist

Organic Compounds

An organic compound is a compound that contains carbon and is found in
living things

-   Exceptions include carbides (e.g. CaC₂), carbonates (CO₃^(2â€“)),
    oxides of carbon (CO, CO₂) and cyanides (CN^(â€“)) Â 

CarbonÂ 

Carbon forms the basis of organic life due to its ability to form large
and complex molecules via covalent bonding

Carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds, with bonds between carbon
atoms being particularly stable (catenation)Â 

-   These properties allows carbon to form a wide variety of organic
    compounds that are chemically stable

proteins and nucleic acids

Main Classes of Carbon Compounds

There are four principle groups of organic compounds that contribute to
much of the structure and function of a cell
Carbohydrates

-   Most abundant organic compound found in nature, composedÂ primarily
    of C,H and O atoms in a common ratio â€“ (CH₂O)_(n)
-   Principally function as a source of energy (and as a short-term
    energy storage option)
-   Also important as a recognition molecule (e.g. glycoproteins) and as
    a structural component (part of DNA / RNA)

Lipids

-   Non-polar, hydrophobic molecules which may come in a variety of
    forms (simple, complex or derived)
-   Lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes (phospholipids
    and cholesterol)
-   They may be utilised as a long-term energy storage molecule (fats
    and oils)
-   Also may function as a signalling molecule (steroids)

Nucleic Acids

-   Genetic material of all cells and determines the inherited features
    of an organism
-   DNA functions as a master code for protein assembly, while RNA plays
    an active role in the manufacturing of proteins

Proteins

-   Make over 50% of the dry weight of cells; are composed of C, H, O
    and N atoms (some may include S)Â 
-   Major regulatory molecules involved in catalysis (all enzymes are
    proteins)
-   May also function as structural molecules or play a role in cellular
    signalling (transduction pathways)

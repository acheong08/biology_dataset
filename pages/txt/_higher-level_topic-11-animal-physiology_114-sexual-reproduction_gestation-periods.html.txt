For mammals, theÂ gestation period is the time taken for a foetus to
develop â€“ beginning with fertilization and ending with birth

-   The duration of the gestation period will differ markedly between
    different species of animal

Generally, there are two main factors that contribute to the length of
the gestation period:

-   Animal size / mass â€“ larger animals tend to have longer gestation
    periods (as they tend to produce larger offspring)
-   The level of development at birth â€“ more developed infants will
    typically require a longer gestation period

The level of development at birth for mammalian infants can be described
as either atricial or precocial

-   Altricial mammals give birth to relatively helpless, undeveloped
    offspring that need extended rearing
-   Precocial mammals give birth to more developed offspring that are
    mobile and independent and require minimal rearing
-   Generally, altricial mammals (e.g. marsupials and rodents) require
    shorter gestation periods than precocial mammals (e.g. ungulates
    such as cows, pigs and rhinoceroses)

While the length of a gestation period does appear to positively
correlate with size and development, other factors also exist

-   Some mammal species may have similar gestation periods despite
    having significantly different body masses

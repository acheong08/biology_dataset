Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA replication is carried out by a complex system of enzymes

Â  Â Â 
DNA replication is a semi-conservative process that is carried out by a
complex system of enzymes

Helicase

-   Helicase unwinds and separates the double-stranded DNA by breaking
    the hydrogen bonds between base pairs
-   This occurs at specific regions (origins of replication), creating a
    replication fork of two strands running in antiparallel directions

DNA Gyrase

-   DNA gyrase reduces the torsional strain created by the unwinding of
    DNA byÂ helicase
-   It does this by relaxing positive supercoils (via negative
    supercoiling) that would otherwise form during the unwinding of DNA

Single Stranded Binding (SSB) Proteins

-   SSB proteins bind to the DNA strands after they have been separated
    and prevent the strands from re-annealing
-   These proteins also help to prevent the single stranded DNA from
    being digested by nucleases
-   SSB proteins will be dislodged from the strand when a new
    complementary strand is synthesised by DNA polymerase III

DNA Primase

-   DNA primase generates a short RNA primer (~10â€“15 nucleotides) on
    each of the template strands
-   The RNA primer provides an initiation point for DNA polymerase III,
    which can extend a nucleotide chain but not start one

DNA Polymerase III

-   Free nucleotides align opposite their complementary base partners (A
    = T ; G = C)
-   DNA pol III attaches to the 3â€™-end of the primerÂ and covalently
    joins the free nucleotides together in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction
-   As DNA strands are antiparallel, DNA pol III moves in opposite
    directions on the two strands
    -   On the leading strand, DNA pol III is moving towards the
        replication fork and can synthesise continuously
    -   On the lagging strand, DNA pol III is moving away from the
        replication fork and synthesises in pieces (Okazaki fragments)

DNA Polymerase I

-   As the lagging strand is synthesised in a series of short fragments,
    it has multiple RNA primers along its length
-   DNA pol I removes the RNA primers from the lagging strand and
    replaces them with DNA nucleotides

DNA Ligase

-   DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together to form a continuous
    strand
-   It does this by covalently joining the sugar-phosphate backbones
    together with a phosphodiester bond

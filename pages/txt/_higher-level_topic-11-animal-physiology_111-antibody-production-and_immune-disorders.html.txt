Immune Disorders

The purpose of the immune system is to maintain normal health, and hence
an abnormal immune response may cause disease

-   The immune system may over-react (hypersensitivity), fail to
    distinguishÂ â€˜selfâ€™ andÂ â€˜non-selfâ€™ (autoimmune conditions)
    or cease working entirely (immunodeficiency)

Hypersensitivity Disorders

Hypersensitivity refers to an excessively disproportionate immune
response to a substance that is not inherently harmful (allergen)

-   Such reactions require a pre-sensitised immune state (prior
    exposure), with an excessive reaction occurring upon re-exposure
-   Allergic reactions are examples of localised hypersensitivity
    conditions, while anaphylaxis is a more severe, systemic example

Autoimmune Disorders

Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system fails to recognise body cells
asÂ â€˜selfâ€™ and begins targeting its own cells and tissues

-   Some pathogens try to evade immune detection by producing antigens
    that closely resemble host markers (antigenic mimicry)
-   Detection of these pathogens will lead to the production of
    antibodies that will recognise and target markers on body cells
-   Examples of autoimmune diseases include diabetes (type I),
    rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis

Immunodeficiency Disorders

Immunodeficiency is a state in which the immune systemâ€™s capacity to
fight infection is compromised or absent entirely

-   These disorders may be inherited (e.g. SCIDs), pathogenic in origin
    (e.g. AIDS) or caused by drug treatments
-   Cytotoxic drugs which cause immunosuppression are commonly used
    during transplant operations to avoid graft rejection

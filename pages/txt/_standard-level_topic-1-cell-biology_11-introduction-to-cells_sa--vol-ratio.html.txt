Understanding:

â€¢ Â Surface area to volume ratio is important in the limitation of
cell size

Â  Â Â 
Cells need to produce chemical energy (via metabolism) to survive and
this requires the exchange of materials with the environment

-   The rate of metabolism of a cell is a function of its mass /
    volumeÂ  (larger cells need more energy to sustain essential
    functions)
-   The rate of material exchange is a function of its surface areaÂ 
    (large membrane surface equates to more material movement)

As a cell grows, volume (units³) increases faster than surface area
(units²), leading to a decreased SA:Vol ratio

-   If metabolic rate exceeds the rate of exchange of vital materials
    and wastes (low SA:Vol ratio), the cell will eventually die
-   Hence growing cells tend to divide and remain small in order to
    maintain a high SA:Vol ratio suitable for survival

Increasing SA:Vol Ratio

Cells and tissues that are specialised for gas or material exchanges
will increase their surface area to optimise material transfer

-   Intestinal tissue of the digestive tract may form a ruffled
    structure (villi) to increase the surface area of the inner lining
-   Alveoli within the lungs have membranous extensions called
    microvilli, which function to increase the total membrane surface

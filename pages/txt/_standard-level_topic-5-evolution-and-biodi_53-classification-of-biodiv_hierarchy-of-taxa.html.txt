Understanding:

â€¢ Â Taxonomists classify species using a hierarchy of taxa

â€¢ Â The principal taxa for classifying eukaryotes are
kingdom,Â phylum, class, order, family, genus and species

Â  Â Â 
Taxonomy is the science involved with classifying groups of organisms on
the basis of shared characteristics

-   Organisms are grouped according to a series of hierarchical taxa â€“
    the more taxa organisms share, the more similar they are
-   TheÂ taxa used are kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and
    species (genus + species = scientific name)

Application:

â€¢ Â Classification of one plant and one animal species from domain to
species level

Â  Â Â 
All plant and animal species belong to the same domain (Eukarya) as they
are composed of eukaryotic cells

-   Beyond this point plants and animals differ in their classification
    as they belong to different kingdoms (Plantae vs Animalia)Â

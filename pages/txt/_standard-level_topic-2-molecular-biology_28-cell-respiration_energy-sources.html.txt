Energy Sources

Cell respiration is typically explained according to the oxidation of a
carbohydrate (glucose), however lipids and proteins can also be used as
energy sources
Carbohydrates are preferable as a ready-made energy source because:Â 

-   They are easier to transport and digest (unlike lipids)Â 
-   They donâ€™t produce nitrogenous wastes (unlike proteins)

Destination

-   Carbohydrates can be broken down into monosaccharides (e.g.
    glucose), which are able to be used in glycolysis
-   Lipids (i.e. triglycerides) can be broken down into glycerol and
    fatty acids, which are able to be used in aerobic respiration
-   Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which are also capable
    of being used in aerobic respiration

Energy Content

-   Lipids produce roughly twice as much energy (~4000 kJ per 100 g) as
    proteins and carbohydrates
-   Both proteins (~1,720 kJ per 100 g)Â and carbohydrates (~1,760 kJ
    per 100 g)Â produce similar levels of energyÂ

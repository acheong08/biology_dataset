Application:

â€¢ Â Non-disjunction can cause Down syndrome and other chromosomal
abnormalities

Â  Â Â 
Non-disjunction refers to the chromosomes failing to separate correctly,
resulting in gametes with one extra, or one missing, chromosome
(aneuploidy)

The failure of chromosomes to separate may occur via:

-   Failure of homologues to separate in Anaphase I (resulting in four
    affected daughter cells)
-   Failure of sister chromatids to separate in Anaphase II (resulting
    in only two daughter cells being affected)Â 

Non-Disjunction

[nondisjunction]

Chromosomal Abnormalities

If a zygote is formed from a gamete that has experienced a
non-disjunction event, the resulting offspring will have extra or
missing chromosomes in every cell of their bodyÂ 
Conditions that arise from non-disjunction events include:

-   Patauâ€™s Syndrome (trisomy 13)
-   Edwards Syndrome (trisomy 18)
-   Down Syndrome (trisomy 21)
-   Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY)
-   Turnerâ€™s Syndrome (monosomy X)

Down Syndrome

Individuals with Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21
(trisomy 21)

-   One of the parental gametes had two copies of chromosome 21 as a
    result of non-disjunction
-   The other parental gamete was normal and had a single copy of
    chromosome 21
-   When the two gametes fused during fertilisation, the resulting
    zygote had three copies of chromosome 21

Application:

â€¢ Â Studies showing age of parents influences chances of
non-disjunction

Â  Â Â 
Studies show that the chances of non-disjunction increase as the age of
the parents increase

-   There is a particularly strong correlation between maternal age and
    the occurrence of non-disjunction events
-   This may be due to developing oocytes being arrested in prophase I
    until ovulation as part of the process of oogenesisÂ 

Other studies also suggest that:

-   The risk of chromosomal abnormalities in offspring increase
    significantly after a maternal age of 30 Â (Table 1 / Figure 1)
-   There is a higher incidence of chromosomal errors in offspring as a
    result of non-disjunction in meiosis I Â (Figure 2)
-   Mean maternal age is increasing, leading to an increase in the
    number of Down syndrome offspring Â (Figure 3)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Free ribosomes synthesise proteins for use primarily within the
cell

â€¢ Â Bound ribosomes synthesise proteins primarily for secretion or for
use in lysosomesÂ 

Â  Â Â 
All proteins produced by eukaryotic cells are initially synthesised by
ribosomes found freely circulating within the cytosol

-   If the protein is targeted for intracellular use within the cytosol,
    the ribosome remains free and unattached
-   If the protein is targeted for secretion, membrane fixation or use
    in lysosomes, the ribosome becomes bound to the ER

Protein destination is determined by the presence or absence of an
initial signal sequence on a nascent polypeptide chain

-   The presence of this signal sequence results in the recruitment of a
    signal recognition particle (SRP), which halts translation
-   The SRP-ribosome complex then docks at a receptor located on the ER
    membrane (formingÂ rough ER)
-   Translation is re-initiated and the polypeptide chain continues to
    grow via a transport channel into the lumen of the ER
    -   The synthesised protein will then be transported via a vesicle
        to the Golgi complex (for secretion) or the lysosome
    -   Proteins targeted for membrane fixation (e.g. integral proteins)
        get embedded into the ER membrane
-   The signal sequence is cleaved and the SRP recycled once the
    polypeptide is completely synthesised within the ER

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Information from the right visual field from both eyes is sent to
the left part of the visual cortex and vice versa

Â  Â Â 
Contralateral processing is when a stimulus is processed on the opposite
side to where it was detected

-   Information from the right half of the visual field is detected by
    the left half of the retina in both eyes and is processed by the
    left hemisphere (and vice versa for the left half of the visual
    field)

Information from each eye may swap at the opticÂ chiasma, so that the
right or left visual field is processed together

-   The optic nerves that swap sides are moving contralaterally, while
    those that stay on the same side remain ipsilateral

Impulses are conducted by the optic nerve to the thalamus, before being
transmitted to the visual cortex (occipital lobe)

-   Thalamic structures (e.g. lateral geniculate nuclei) are involved in
    coordinating eye movements and circadian rhythms

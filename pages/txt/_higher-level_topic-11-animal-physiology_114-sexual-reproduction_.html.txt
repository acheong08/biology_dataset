11.4 Â Sexual Reproduction

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Sexual reproduction involves theÂ 
development and fusion of haploid gametes

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Spermatogenesis and oogenesis both involve mitosis, cell growth, two
    divisions of meiosis and differentiation
-   Processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis result in different
    numbers of gametes with different amounts of cytoplasm
-   Fertilization in animals can be internal or external
-   Fertilization involves mechanisms that prevent polyspermy
-   Implantation of the blastocyst in the endometrium is essential for
    the continuation of pregnancy
-   hCG stimulates the ovary to secrete progesterone during early
    pregnancy
-   The placenta facilitates the exchange of materials between the
    mother andÂ fetus
-   Estrogen and progesterone are secreted by the placenta once it has
    formed
-   Birth is mediated by positive feedback involving estrogen and
    oxytocin

Applications:

-   The average 38-week pregnancy in humans can be positioned on a graph
    showing the correlation between animal size and the development of
    the young at birth for other mammals

Skills:

-   Annotation of diagrams of seminiferous tubule and ovary to show the
    stages of gametogenesis
-   Annotation of diagrams of mature sperm and egg to indicate functions

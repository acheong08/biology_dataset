Understanding:

â€¢ Â Synovial joints allow certain movements but not others

Â  Â Â 
Synovial joints are capsules that surround the articulating surfaces of
two bones (i.e. where the bones connect)

-   Joints function to maintain structural stability by allowing certain
    movements but not others

Synovial joints consist of three main components:

-   Joint capsule â€“ Seals the joint space and provides stability by
    restricting the range of possible movements
-   Cartilage â€“ Lines the bone surface to facilitate smoother
    movement, as well as absorbing shock and distributing load
-   Synovial fluid â€“ Provides oxygen and nutrition to the cartilage,
    as well as lubrication (reduces friction)

There are six main types of synovial joints that allow for different
ranges of movement, which are (in order of mobility):

-   Plane joints (least mobility), hinge joints, pivot joints, condyloid
    joints, saddle joints, ball and socket joints (most mobility)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram of the human elbow

Â  Â Â 
The human elbow joint is an example of a hinge joint that is located
between the humerus and radius / ulna

-   It is capable of angular movement in one direction (i.e. flexion and
    extension only)
-   A small amount of rotation may be possible, but excessive multiaxial
    movement will cause injury

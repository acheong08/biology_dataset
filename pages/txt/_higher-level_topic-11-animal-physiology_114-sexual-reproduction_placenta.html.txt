Understanding:

â€¢ Â The placenta facilitates the exchange of materials between the
mother andÂ fetus

â€¢ Â Estrogen and progesterone are secreted by the placenta once it has
formed

Â  Â Â 
The placenta functions as the life support system for theÂ foetus,
serving two key functions:

-   It facilitates the exchange of materials between the mother
    andÂ foetus
-   It secretes hormones to maintain the pregnancy after the corpus
    luteum has degenerated

Structure of the Placenta

-   The placenta is a disc-shaped structure that nourishes the
    developing foetus
-   It is formed from the development of the trophoblast upon
    implantation and eventually invades the uterine wall
-   Maternal blood pools via open ended arterioles into intervillous
    spaces within the placenta called lacunae
-   Chorionic villi extend into these pools of blood and mediate the
    exchange of materials between the foetus and the mother
-   Exchanged material is transported from the villi to the foetus via
    an umbilical cord, which connects the foetus to the placenta
-   Upon birth, the placenta is expelled from the uterus with the infant
    â€“ it is then separated from the infant by severing the umbilical
    cord (the point of separation becomes the belly button)

Overview of the Structure of the Placenta

Material Exchange

-   The chorionic villi extend into the intervillous space (lacuna) and
    exchange materials between the mother and foetus
-   Chorionic villi are lined by microvilli to increase the available
    surface area for material exchange
-   Foetal capillaries within the chorionic villi lie close to the
    surface to minimise diffusion distance from blood in the lacunae
-   Materials such as oxygen, nutrients, vitamins, antibodies and water
    will diffuse from the lacunae into foetal capillaries
-   Foetal waste (such as carbon dioxide, urea and hormones) will
    diffuse from the lacunae into the maternal blood vessels

Exchange of Materials between Foetal and Maternal Blood

Hormonal Role

-   The placenta takes over the hormonal role of the ovaries (at ~12
    weeks) and begins producing estrogen and progesterone
-   Estrogen stimulates the growth of uterine muscles (myometrium) and
    the development of the mammary glands
-   Progesterone maintains the endometrium, as well as reducing uterine
    contractions and potential maternal immune responses
-   Both estrogen and progesterone levels drop near the time of birth

3.2 Â Chromosomes

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Chromosomes carry genes in a linear sequence
that is shared by members of a species

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   Prokaryotes have one chromosome consisting of a circular DNA
    molecule
-   Some prokaryotes also have plasmids but eukaryotes do not
-   Eukaryote chromosomes are linear DNA molecules associated with
    histone proteins
-   In a eukaryote species there are different chromosomes that carry
    different genes
-   Homologous chromosomes carry the same sequence of genes but not
    necessarily the same alleles of those genes
-   Diploid nuclei have pairs of homologous chromosomes
-   Haploid nucleiÂ have one chromosome of each pair
-   The number of chromosomes is a characteristic feature of members of
    a species
-   A karyogram shows the chromosomes of an organism in homologous pairs
    of decreasing length
-   Sex is determined by sex chromosomes and autosomes are chromosomes
    that do not determine sex

Applications:

-   Cairns' technique for measuring the length of DNA molecules by
    autoradiography
-   Comparison of genome size in T2 phage, Escherichia coli, Drosophila
    melanogaster, Homo sapiens and Paris japonica
-   Comparison of diploid chromosome numbers of Homo sapiens, Pan
    troglodytes, CanisÂ familiaris, Oryza sativa and Parascaris equorum
-   Use of karyograms to deduce sex and diagnose Down syndrome in humans

Skills:

-   Use of databases to identify the locus of a human gene and its
    polypeptide product

Application:

â€¢ Â Red-green colour-blindness as a variant of normal trichromatic
vision

Â  Â Â 
Red-green colour blindness is a genetic disorder whereby an individual
fails to discriminate between red and green hues

-   There are three different types of cone cells, each of which absorbs
    different wavelengths (trichromatic: red, green, blue)
-   The genes responsible for producing red or green photoreceptors are
    located on the X chromosome (sex-linked)
-   If either of these genes are mutated, red and green wavelengths
    cannot be distinguished
-   As these genes are recessive and located on the X chromosome,
    red-green colour-blindness is more common in males
-   Red-green colour-blindness can be diagnosed using the Ishihara
    colour test

Application:

â€¢ Â Use of cochlear implants in deaf patients

Â  Â Â 
Cochlear implants may be used to stimulate the auditory centres of the
brain in patients with non-functioning hair cells

-   Standard hearing aids are ineffective in deaf patients as they
    amplify sounds but do not bypass defective hearing structures

Cochlear implants consist of two parts â€“ an external part (microphone
/ transmitter) and an internal part (receiver / stimulator)

-   The external components detect sounds, filter out extraneous
    frequencies and then transmit the signals to the internal parts
-   The internal components receive the transmissions and
    produceÂ electrical signals via electrodes embedded in the cochlea
-   The electrical signals are then transferred via the auditory nerve
    to be processed by the brain

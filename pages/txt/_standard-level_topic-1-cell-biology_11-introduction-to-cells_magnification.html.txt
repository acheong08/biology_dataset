Skill:

â€¢ Â Calculation ofÂ magnification and the actual size of structures
shown in drawings or micrographs

Â  Â Â 
Calculation of Magnification:

To calculate the linear magnification of a drawing or image, the
following equation should be used:

-   Magnification = Image size (with ruler)Â Ã·Â Actual size (according
    to scale bar)

Calculation of Actual Size:

To calculate the actual size of a magnified specimen, the equation is
simply rearranged:

-   Actual Size = Image size (with ruler)Â Ã·Â Magnification

Skill:

â€¢ Â Use of a light microscope to investigate the structure of cells
and tissues, with drawings of cells

Â  Â Â 
Light microscopes use visible light and a combination of lenses to
magnify images of mounted specimens

-   Living specimens can be viewed in their natural colour, although
    stains may be applied to resolve specific structures

When attempting to draw microscopic structures, the following
conventions should be followed:

-   A title should be included to identify the specimen (e.g. name of
    organism, tissue or cell)
-   A magnification or scale should be included to indicate relative
    size
-   Identifiable structures should be clearly labelled (drawings should
    only reflect what is seen, not idealised versions)

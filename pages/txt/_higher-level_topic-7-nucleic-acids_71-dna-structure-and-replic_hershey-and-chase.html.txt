â€¢ Â Analysis of results of the Hershey and Chase experiment providing
evidence that DNA is the genetic material

Â  Â Â 
In the mid-twentieth century, scientists were still unsure as to whether
DNA or protein was the genetic material of the cell

-   It was known that some viruses consisted solely of DNA and a protein
    coat and could transfer their genetic material into hosts

In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase conducted a series of
experiments to prove that DNA was the genetic material

-   Viruses (T2 bacteriophage) were grown in one of two isotopic mediums
    in order to radioactively label a specific viral component
    -   Viruses grown in radioactive sulfur (³⁵S) had radiolabelled
        proteins (sulfur is present in proteins but not DNA)
    -   Viruses grown in radioactive phosphorus (³²P) had radiolabeled
        DNA (phosphorus is present in DNA but not proteins)

The viruses were then allowed to infect a bacterium (E. coli) and then
the virus and bacteria were separated via centrifugation

-   The larger bacteria formed a solid pellet while the smaller viruses
    remained in the supernatant

The bacterial pellet was found to be radioactive when infected by the
³²Pâ€“viruses (DNA) but not the ³⁵Sâ€“viruses (protein)

-   This demonstrated that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material
    because DNA was transferred to the bacteria

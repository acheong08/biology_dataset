Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some nutrients in excess can be stored in the liver

â€¢ Â Surplus cholesterol is converted into bile salts

The liver plays an important role in regulating the levels of nutrients
in the bloodstream

-   Nutrients absorbed by the small intestine are transported by the
    hepatic portal vein to the liver for metabolism
-   The liver converts these nutrients into forms that can be stored or
    used and mediates their transport to various tissues
-   Nutrients stored within the liver include glycogen, iron, vitamin A
    and vitamin D

Carbohydrate Metabolism

-   Excess glucose in the bloodstream (e.g. after meals) is taken up by
    the liver and stored as glycogenÂ 
-   When blood glucose levels drop, the liver breaks down glycogen into
    glucose and exports it to body tissues
-   When hepatic glycogen reserves become exhausted, the liver
    synthesises glucose from other sources (e.g. fats)
-   These metabolic processes are coordinated by the pancreatic hormones
    â€“ insulin and glucagon

Protein Metabolism

-   The body can not store amino acids, meaning they must be broken down
    when in excess
-   Amino acid breakdown releases an amine group (NH₂), which cannot be
    used by the body and is potentially toxic
-   The liver is responsible for the removal of the amine group
    (deamination) and its conversion into a harmless product
-   The amine group is converted into urea by the liver, which is
    excreted within urine by the kidneys
-   The liver can also synthesise non-essential amino acids from surplus
    stock (viaÂ transamination)

Fat Metabolism

-   The liver is the major site for converting excess carbohydrates and
    proteins into fatty acids and triglycerides
-   It is alsoÂ responsible for the synthesis of large quantities of
    phospholipids and cholesterolÂ 
-   These compounds are then stored by the liver or exported to cells by
    different types of lipoproteins
-   Low density lipoprotein (LDL) transports cholesterol to cells, for
    use in the cell membrane and in steroid synthesis
-   High density lipoprotein (HDL) transports excess cholesterol from
    cells back to the liver (for storage or conversion)
-   LDL is consideredÂ â€˜badâ€™Â as it raises blood cholesterol levels,
    while HDL lowers cholesterol levels and is therefore â€˜goodâ€™
-   Surplus cholesterol is converted by the liver into bile salts, which
    can be eliminated from the body via the bowels

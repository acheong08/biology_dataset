Microarrays

Microarrays can be used to determine gene expression patterns in a
particular cell or tissue

A DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA sequences (oligos)
attached to a solid surface

-   These sequences represent fractions of a large library of genes that
    are present in a cell
-   If a gene is active within a cell, then the cDNA (produced from the
    mRNA transcript) will bind to its complementary oligo
-   If the cDNA has been fluorescently labeled, then the complementary
    oligo can be identifiedÂ (along with the gene it represents)
-   If cDNA from healthy and diseased cells are labeled with different
    fluorophores, comparisons of gene expression can be made
-   Genes that areÂ onlyÂ active in a diseased or normal state will be
    of particular interest to scientists

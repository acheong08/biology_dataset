â€¢ Â Design of an experiment to assess one factor affecting the rooting
of stem cuttings

Â  Â Â 
A stem cutting is a separated portion of plant stem that can regrow into
a new independent clone via vegetative propagation

-   All stems possessÂ nodes, from which a leaf, branch or aerial root
    may grow â€“ the region between nodes are called internodes
-   Stem cuttings are typically placed in soil with the lower nodes
    covered and the upper nodes exposed
-   Stem cutting is a common method employed to rapidly propagate plant
    species (including sugar cane, grapes and roses)

There are a variety of factors that will influence successful rooting of
a stem cutting, including:

-   Cutting position (whether cutting occurs above or below a node, as
    well as the relative proximity of the cut to the node)
-   Length of cutting (including how many nodes remain on the cutting)
-   Growth medium (whether left in soil, water, potting mix, compost or
    open air)
-   The use and concentration of growth hormones (e.g. IAA, IBA and NAA
    promote the formation of adventitious roots)
-   Temperature conditions (most cuttings grow optimally at temperatures
    common to spring and summer)
-   Availability of water (either in the form of ground water or
    humidity)
-   Other environmental conditions (including pH of the soil and light
    exposure)

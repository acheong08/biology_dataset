Understanding:

â€¢ Â Transcription occurs in a 5â€™ to 3â€™ direction

Â  Â Â 
Transcription is the process by which a DNA sequence (gene) is copied
into a complementary RNA sequence by RNA polymerase

-   Free nucleotides exist in the cell as nucleoside triphosphates
    (NTPs), which line up opposite their complementary base partner
-   RNA polymerase covalently binds the NTPs together in a reaction that
    involves the release of the two additional phosphates
-   The 5â€™-phosphate is linked to the 3â€™-end of the growing mRNA
    strand, hence transcription occurs in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction

Overview of Transcription

The process of transcription can be divided into three main steps:
initiation, elongation and termination

-   In initiation, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and causes the
    unwinding and separating of the DNA strands
-   Elongation occurs as the RNA polymerase moves along the coding
    sequence, synthesising RNA in a 5â€™Â â†’ 3â€™Â direction
-   When RNA polymerase reaches the terminator, both the enzyme and
    nascent RNA strand detach and the DNA rewinds

Many RNA polymerase enzymes can transcribe a DNA sequence sequentially,
producing a large number of transcriptsÂ 

-   In eukaryotes, post-transcriptional modification of the RNA sequence
    is necessary to form mature mRNA

Nitrogenous Bases

Nucleic acids are composed of a combination of 5 nitrogenous bases:

-   Guanine and adenine are double-ringed purine molecules
-   Cytosine, thymine and uracil are single-ringed pyrimidine molecules

Thymine and uracil are chemically similar molecules â€“ thymine is
present in DNA, while uracil is used in RNA

Complementary Base Pairing

The nitrogenous bases may form hydrogen bonds according to complementary
base pairing:

-   Adenine always forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine / uracil
-   Guanine always forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine

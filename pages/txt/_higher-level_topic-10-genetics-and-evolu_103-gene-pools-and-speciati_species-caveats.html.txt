Species Caveats

A species is a population, or group of populations, whose members have
the potential to interbreed to produce fertile, viable offspring

-   Members of a species are unable to produce fertile, viable offspring
    with members of a different species
-   Hybrids are infertile offspring produced from cross-breeding between
    two different species (e.g. mules, ligers, etc.)

There are a number of caveats to the traditional definition of a
species, including:

-   Certain organisms do not reproduce sexually (e.g. bacteria) but can
    transfer genetic material via plasmid exchange
-   Some past organisms are known only through fossils, with no living
    representatives, so breeding capacity is unestablished
-   Geographically isolated populations may never come into physical
    contact, meaning breeding capacity is unestablished
-   It may be physically impossible for certain members of the same
    species to interbreed (e.g. certain dog breeds)
-   Some species spread around an area to form interlinked populations,
    whereby the populationÂ â€˜endsâ€™Â cannot interbreed (ring species)

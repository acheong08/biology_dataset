Understanding:

â€¢ Â Components of red blood cells are recycled by the liver

Â  Â Â 
In humans, red blood cells possess minimal organelles and no nucleus in
order to carry moreÂ haemoglobin

-   Consequently, red blood cells have a short lifespan (~120 days) and
    must be constantly replaced

The liver is responsible for the break down of red blood cells and
recycling of its components

-   These components are used to make either new red blood cells or
    other important compounds (e.g. bile)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The breakdown of erythrocytes starts with phagocytosis of red
blood cells by Kupffer cells

â€¢ Â Iron is carried to the bone marrow to produce haemoglobin in new
red blood cells

Â  Â Â 
Kupffer cells are specialised phagocytes within the liver which engulf
red blood cells and break them down

-   Kupffer cells break down haemoglobin into globin and iron-containing
    heme groups
-   Globin is digested by peptidases to produce amino acids (which are
    either recycled or metabolised by the liver)
-   Heme groups are broken down into iron and bilirubin (bile pigment)

The released iron must be complexed within a protein in order to avoid
oxidation to a ferric state

-   Iron can be stored by the liver within a protein shell of ferritin
-   Iron can be transported to the bone marrow (where new haemoglobin is
    produced) within the protein transferrin

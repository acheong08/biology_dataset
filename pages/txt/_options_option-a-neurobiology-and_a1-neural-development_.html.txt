A1 Â Neural Development

[big ninja]

Essential Idea:
Modification of neurons starts in the earliest stages of
embryogenesis and continues to the final years of life

Â  Â  Â 
Understandings:

-   The neural tube of embryonic chordates is formed by infolding of
    ectoderm followed by elongation of the tube
-   Neurons are initially produced by differentiation in the neural tube
-   Immature neurons migrate to a final location
-   An axon grows from each immature neuron in response to chemical
    stimuli
-   Some axons extend beyond the neural tube to reach other parts of the
    body
-   A developing neuron forms multiple synapses
-   Synapses that are not used do not persist
-   Neural pruning involves the loss of unusedÂ neurons
-   The plasticity of the nervous system allows it to change with
    experience

Applications:

-   Incomplete closure of the embryonic neural tube can cause spina
    bifida
-   Events such as strokes may promote reorganisation of brain function

Skills:

-   Annotation of a diagram of embryonic tissues in Xenopus, used as an
    animal model, during neurulation

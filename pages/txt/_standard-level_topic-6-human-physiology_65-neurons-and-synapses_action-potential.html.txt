Understanding:

â€¢ Â An action potential consists of depolarization and repolarization
of theÂ neuron

Â  Â Â 
Action potentials are the rapid changes in charge across the membrane
that occur when a neuron is firing

-   Action potentials occur in three main stages: depolarization,
    repolarization and a refractory period

Depolarisation

Depolarisation refers to a sudden change in membrane potential â€“
usually from a (relatively) negative to positiveÂ internal charge

-   In response to a signal initiated at a dendrite, sodium channels
    open within the membrane of the axon
-   As Na⁺ ions are more concentrated outside of theÂ neuron, the
    opening of sodium channels causes a passive influx of sodium
-   The influx of sodium causes the membrane potential to become more
    positive (depolarisation)

Repolarisation

Repolarisation refers to the restoration of a membrane potential
following depolarisation (i.e. restoring a negative internal charge)

-   Following an influx of sodium, potassium channels open within the
    membrane of the axon
-   As K⁺ ions are more concentrated inside the neuron, opening
    potassium channels causes a passive efflux of potassium
-   The efflux of potassium causes the membrane potential to return to a
    more negative internal differential (repolarisation)

Refractory Period

The refractory period refers to the period of time following a nerve
impulse before the neuron is able to fire again

-   In a normal resting state, sodium ions are predominantly outside the
    neuron and potassium ions mainly inside (resting potential)
-   Following depolarisation (sodium influx) and repolarisation
    (potassium efflux), this ionic distribution is largely reversed
-   Before a neuron can fire again, the resting potential must be
    restored via the antiport action of the sodium-potassium pumpÂ

Endocrine System

The endocrine system is a system of ductless glands that release
chemicals (hormones) into the blood to regulate body functions

-   A hormone is a chemical messenger that is transported via the
    bloodstream to act on distant target cells
-   Hormones are specific and will only activate cells or tissues that
    possess the appropriate target receptor
-   The endocrine system is slower to initiate, but has a more prolonged
    response when compared to the nervous system

Endocrine Signalling

Endocrine Glands

Endocrine glands secrete their product (hormones) directly into the
bloodstream, rather than through a duct (e.g. exocrine gland)

-   Major endocrine glands include the pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid
    gland, pineal gland and the gonads (ovaries and testes)
-   The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine glands and
    function to link the nervous and endocrine systems
-   Some organs may also secrete hormones despite not being endocrine
    glands (e.g. adipose tissue secretes leptin)

Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the section of the brain that links the nervous and
endocrine systems in order to maintain homeostasis

-   It receives information from nerves throughout the body and other
    parts of the brain and initiates endocrine responses
-   It secretes certain neurochemicals (called releasing factors) into a
    portal system which stimulate or inhibit the pituitary gland
-   It also secretes certain hormones directly into the bloodstream via
    neurosecretory cells that extend into the pituitary gland

The pituitary gland lies adjacent to the hypothalamus and is in direct
contact due to a portal blood system

-   The pituitary gland is often referred to as theÂ â€˜master glandâ€™,
    as it controls the secretion of a number of other endocrine glands
-   The pituitary gland receives instructions from the hypothalamus and
    consists of two lobes (anterior and posterior lobe)
    -   The anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) releases hormones in
        response to stimulation by hypothalamic releasing factors
    -   The posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) releases hormones produced
        by the hypothalamus itself (via neurosecretory cells)

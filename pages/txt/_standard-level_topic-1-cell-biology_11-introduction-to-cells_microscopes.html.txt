Microscopes

Microscopes are scientific instruments that are used to visualise
objects that are too small to see with the naked eye

There are two main types of microscope: optical (light) microscopes and
electron microscopes

Light Microscopes

-   Use lenses to bend light and magnify images by a factor of roughly
    100-fold
-   Can be used to view living specimens in natural colour
-   Chemical dyes and fluorescent labelling may be applied to resolve
    specific structures

Electron Microscopes

-   Use electromagnets to focus electrons resulting in significantly
    greater magnifications and resolutions
-   Can be used to view dead specimens in monochrome (although false
    colour rendering may be applied)
    -   Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) pass electrons through
        specimen to generate a cross-section
    -   Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) scatter electrons over a
        surface to differentiate depth and map in 3D

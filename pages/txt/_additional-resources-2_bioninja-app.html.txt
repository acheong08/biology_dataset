BioNinja App

[bioninja app]

The BioNinja App for iOS devices (iPads and iPhones) is now complete!

It can be found on the iTunes Store:Â Click here

-   If you like it, please give it a positive review!
-   If you donâ€™t like it, shut up! (seriously, itâ€™s free - so
    donâ€™t be a troll)

Please Note:Â Be sure toÂ refreshÂ the app the first time you load it
(to update to latest version)

-   External assets (e.g. songs and animations) will not work until the
    app has been refreshed

More Information:

-   I had to really rush the process in order to get the app released
    before the May 2018 exams
-   Unless there is something seriously wrong, I donâ€™t plan on fixing
    any of the quirks (too hard!)
-   If there are any issues, please just send me an email rather than
    posting a bad review
-   Please be aware that the songs and animations may not work on really
    old devices
-   Also, the sound wonâ€™t work if the phone is set to silent / vibrate
    (you need toÂ unmuteÂ it)

Attention: Android Users

I am trying to get an Android version completed as well, but Iâ€™m not
exactly a tech expert and am having some issues

-   If anyone is proficient at coding and wants to give it a go (for
    free - Iâ€™m not paying for a free app!) - contact me!

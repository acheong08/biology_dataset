â€¢ Â Causes and consequences of hypertension and thrombosis

Â  Â Â 
Hypertension

-   Hypertension is defined as an abnormally high blood pressure â€“
    either systolic, diastolic or both (e.g. > 140/90 mmHg)
-   Common causes of hypertension include a sedentary lifestyle, salt or
    fat-rich diets and excessive alcohol or tobacco use
-   High blood pressure can also be secondary to other conditions (e.g.
    kidney disease) or caused by some medications
-   Hypertension itself does not cause symptoms but in the long-term
    leads to consequences caused by narrowing blood vessels

Thrombosis

-   Thrombosis is the formation of a clot within a blood vessel that
    forms part of the circulatory system
-   Thrombosis occurs in arteries when the vessels are damaged as a
    result of the deposition of cholesterol (atherosclerosis)
-   Atheromas (fat deposits) develop in the arteries and significantly
    reduce the diameter of the vessel (leading to hypertension)
-   The high blood pressure damages the arterial wall, forming lesions
    known as atherosclerotic plaques
-   If a plaque ruptures, blood clotting is triggered, forming a
    thrombus that restricts blood flow
-   If the thrombus becomes dislodged it becomes an embolus and can
    cause blockage at another site
-   Thrombosis in the coronary arteries leads to heart attacks, while
    thrombosis in the brain causes strokes

Causes and Consequences of Coronary Thrombosis

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of epidemiological data relating to the incidence of
coronary heart disease

Â  Â Â 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) describes the condition caused by the build
up of plaque within the coronary arteries

-   It is essentially the consequence of atherosclerosis in the blood
    vessels that supply and sustain heart tissue

The incidence of coronary heart disease will vary in different
populations according to the occurrence of certain risk factors

-   E.g. The incidence of CHD under the age of 65 is substantially
    higher in indigenous Australians (versus non indigenous)Â

There are several risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD),
including:

-   AgeÂ â€“ Blood vessels become less flexible with advancing age
-   GeneticsÂ â€“ Having hypertension predispose individuals to
    developing CHDÂ 
-   ObesityÂ â€“ Being overweight places an additional strain on the
    heart
-   DiseasesÂ â€“ Certain diseases increase the risk of CHD (e.g.
    diabetes)
-   DietÂ â€“ Diets rich in saturated fats, salts and alcohol increases
    the risk
-   ExerciseÂ â€“ Sedentary lifestyles increase the risk of developing
    CHD
-   SexÂ â€“ Males are at a greater risk due to lower oestrogen levels
-   SmokingÂ â€“ Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, raising blood
    pressure

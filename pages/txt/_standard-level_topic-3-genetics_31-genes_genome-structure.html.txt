Genome Structure

The human genome comprises of roughly 3.2 billion base pairs across 46
chromosomes

-   However, only a small fraction of this sequence codes for functional
    genes (roughly 1.5% of theÂ genome)
-   The remainder is made up of repeating elements,
    pseudogenes,Â microsatellites and transposons

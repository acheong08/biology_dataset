Understanding:

â€¢ Â Fusion of gametes results in diploid zygotes with two alleles of
each gene that may be the same alleleÂ 

Â  Â or different alleles

Â  Â Â 
Gametes are haploid, meaning they only possess one allele for each gene

When male and female gametes fuse during fertilisation, the resulting
zygote will containÂ two alleles for each gene

-   Exception: Males have only one allele for each gene located on a sex
    chromosome, as these chromosomes arenâ€™t paired (XY)Â 

For any given gene, the combination of alleles can be categorised as
follows:

-   If the maternal and paternal alleles are the same, the offspring is
    said to be homozygous for that gene
-   If the maternal and paternal alleles are different, the offspring is
    said to be heterozygous for that gene
-   Males only have one allele for each gene located on a sex chromosome
    and are said to be hemizygous for that gene

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Reduced NADP and ATP are produced in the light dependent reactions

Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
The production of ATP by the light dependent reactions is called
photophosphorylation, as it uses light as an energy source

-   Photophosphorylation may be either a cyclic process or a non-cyclic
    process

Cyclic Photophosphorylation

-   Cyclic photophosphorylation involves the use of only one photosystem
    (PS I) and does not involve the reduction of NADP⁺
-   When light is absorbed by Photosystem I, the excited electron may
    enter into an electron transport chain to produce ATP
-   Following this, the de-energised electron returns to the
    photosystem, restoring its electron supply (hence: cyclic)
-   As the electron returns to the photosystem, NADP⁺ is not reduced and
    water is not needed to replenish the electron supply

Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation

-   Non-cyclic photophosphorylation involves two photosystems (PS I and
    PS II) and does involve the reduction of NADP⁺
-   When light is absorbed by Photosystem II, the excited electrons
    enter into an electron transport chain to produce ATP
-   Concurrently, photoactivation of Photosystem I results in the
    release of electrons which reduce NADP⁺ (forms NADPH)
-   The photolysis of water releases electrons which replace those lost
    by Photosystem II (PS I electrons replaced by PS II)

Cyclic vs Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation

-   Cyclic photophosphorylation can be used to produce a steady supply
    of ATP in the presence of sunlight
-   However, ATP is a highly reactive molecule and hence cannot be
    readily stored within the cell
-   Non-cyclic photophosphorylation produces NADPH in addition to ATP
    (this requires the presence of water)
-   Both NADPH and ATP are required to produce organic molecules via the
    light independent reactions
-   Hence, only non-cyclic photophosphorylation allows for the synthesis
    of organic molecules and long term energy storage

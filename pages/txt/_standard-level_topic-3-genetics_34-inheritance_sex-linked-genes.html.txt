Understanding:

â€¢ Â Some genetic diseases are sex-linked

Â  Â Â 
Sex linkage refers to when a gene controlling a characteristic is
located on a sex chromosome (X or Y)

-   The Y chromosome is much shorter than the X chromosome and contains
    only a few genes (50 million bp; 78 genes)
-   The X chromosome is longer and contains many genes not present on
    the Y chromosomes (153 million bp ; ~ 2,000 genes)
-   Hence, sex-linked conditions are usually X-linked - as very few
    genes exist on the shorter Y chromosome

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The pattern of inheritance is different with sex-linked genes due
to their location on sex chromosomes

Â  Â Â 
Sex-linked inheritance patterns differ from autosomal patterns due to
the fact that the chromosomes arenâ€™t paired in males (XY)

-   This leads to the expression of sex-linked traits being
    predominantly associated with a particularly gender

As human females have two X chromosomes (and therefore two alleles),
they can be either homozygous or heterozygous

-   Hence, X-linked dominant traits are more common in females (as
    either allele may be dominant and cause disease)

Human males have only one X chromosome (and therefore only one allele)
and are hemizygous for X-linked traits

-   X-linked recessive traits are more common in males, as the condition
    cannot be masked by a second allele

The following trends always hold true for X-linked conditions:

-   Only females can be carriers (a heterozygote for a recessive disease
    condition), males cannot be heterozygous carriers
-   Males will always inherit an X-linked trait from their mother (they
    inherit a Y chromosome from their father)
-   Females cannot inherit an X-linked recessive condition from an
    unaffected father (must receive his dominant allele)

Application:

â€¢ Â Red-green colour blindness and haemophilia as examples of
sex-linked inheritance

Â  Â Â 
Red-green colour blindness andÂ haemophilia are both examples of
X-linked recessive conditions

-   Consequently, they are both far more common in males than in females
    (males cannot mask the trait as a carrier)

When assigning alleles for a sex-linked trait, the convention is to
write the allele as a superscript to the sex chromosome (X)

-   Haemophilia:Â  X^(H) = unaffected (normal blood clotting) ; X^(h) =
    affected (haemophilia)
-   Colour blindness: Â X^(A) = unaffected (normal vision) ; X^(a) =
    affected (colour blindness)

Haemophilia

Haemophilia is a genetic disorder whereby the bodyâ€™s ability to
control blood clotting (and hence stop bleeding) is impaired

-   The formation of a blood clot is controlled by a cascade of
    coagulation factors whose genes are located on the X chromosome
-   When one of these factors becomes defective, fibrin formation is
    prevented - meaning bleeding continues for a long time
-   Different forms of haemophilia can occur, based on which specific
    coagulation factor is mutated (e.g. haemophilia A = factor VIII)

Red-Green Colour Blindness

Red-green colour blindness is a genetic disorder whereby an individual
fails to discriminate between red and green hues

-   This condition is caused by a mutation to the red or green retinal
    photoreceptors, which are located on the X chromosome
-   Red-green colour blindness can be diagnosed using the Ishihara
    colour test

Application:

â€¢ Â Rosalind Franklinâ€™s and Maurice Wilkinsâ€™ investigation of DNA
structure by X-ray diffraction

Â  Â Â 
Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins used a method of X-ray diffraction
to investigate the structure of DNA

-   DNA was purified and then fibres were stretched in a thin glass tube
    (to make most of the strands parallel)
-   The DNA was targeted by a X-ray beam, which was diffracted when it
    contacted an atom
-   The scattering pattern of the X-ray was recorded on a film and used
    to elucidate details of molecular structure

Summary of the Process of X-Ray Crystallography

[x-ray crystallography]

From the scattering pattern produced by a DNA molecule, certain
inferences could be made about its structure

-   Composition: Â DNA is a double stranded molecule
-   Orientation: Â Nitrogenous bases are closely packed together on the
    inside and phosphates form an outer backbone
-   Shape: Â The DNA molecule twists at regular intervals (every 34
    Angstrom) to form a helix (two strands = double helix)

Franklinâ€™s data was shared by Wilkins with James Watson (without
Franklinâ€™sÂ permission) who, with the help of Francis Crick, used the
information to create a molecular model of the basic structure of DNA

-   In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins (but not Franklin) were awarded
    the Nobel prize for their contributions to DNA structure
    identification

Understanding:

â€¢ Â DNA structure suggested a mechanism for DNA replication

Â  Â Â 
Franklinâ€™s x-ray diffraction experiments demonstrated that the DNA
helix is both tightly packed and regular in structure

-   Phosphates (and sugars) form an outer backbone and nitrogenous bases
    are packaged within the interior

Chargaff had also demonstrated thatÂ DNA is composed of an equal number
of purines (A + G) and pyrimidines (C + T)Â 

-   This indicates that these nitrogenous bases are paired (purine +
    pyrimidine) within the double helix
-   In order for this pairing between purines and pyrimidines to occur,
    the two strands must run in antiparallel directions

When Watson & Crick were developing their DNA model, they discovered
that an Aâ€“T bond was the same length as a Gâ€“C bond

-   Adenine and thymine paired via two hydrogen bonds, whereas guanine
    and cytosine paired via three hydrogen bonds
-   If the bases were always paired this way, then this would describe
    the regular structure of the DNA helix (shown by Franklin)

Consequently, DNA structure suggests two mechanisms for DNA replication:

-   Replication occurs via complementary base pairing (adenine pairs
    with thymine, guanine pairs with cytosine)
-   Replication is bi-directional (proceeds in opposite directions on
    the two strands) due to the antiparallel nature of the strands

Biogeochemical Cycles

A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which a chemical substance moves
through the biotic and abiotic spheres of the Earth

-   While the carbon cycle is the most well known pathway, other
    biogeochemical cycles are equally important to life on Earth
-   These other biogeochemical processes include the nitrogen cycle,
    phosphorus cycle and sulphur cycle

Nitrogen Cycle

-   The majority of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere is composed on nitrogen gas
    (N₂ = ~79%) however it is chemically inert in this form
-   Atmospheric nitrogen must be chemically processed by nitrogen-fixing
    bacteria in order to be used by plants
-   Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil as nitrite ions, nitrate ions
    or ammonium, while animals consume these products from plants
-   When organisms die, nitrogen is in an organic form (proteins) and
    must be converted back into inorganic form (ammonification)
-   Nitrogen in the soil is converted back into inert nitrogen gas by
    denitrifying bacteria

Phosphorus Cycle

-   Phosphorus is a primary component of DNA and energy-storing
    molecules (ATP), and is present in membranes (phospholipids)
-   Phosphorus-based compounds are usually solid and hence phosphorus is
    not found as a gas in the atmosphere
-   Phosphorus (as phosphates) is incorporated and fixed to soil
    particles but may be released by the weathering of rocks
-   Phosphates may enter the waterways via erosion and leaching

[phosphorus cycle]

Sulphur Cycle

-   Sulphur is an essential component of living organisms, being a
    constituent part of many proteins and enzyme cofactors
-   Sulphur in the air and soil may be oxidised to form sulphates
    (SO₄^(2â€“))
-   Sulphates are reduced by plants and bacteria and hence sulphur
    becomes incorporated into organic molecules
-   Sulphur within the soil can also be mineralised into inorganic forms
    and incorporated with metals (e.g. ironÂ sulphide)
-   Burning of fossil fuels releases sulphur as sulphur dioxide (SO₂),
    which is an enabling component of acid rain

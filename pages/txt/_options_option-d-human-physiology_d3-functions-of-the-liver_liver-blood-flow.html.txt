Understanding:

â€¢ Â The liver intercepts blood from the gut to regulate nutrient
levels

Â  Â Â 
The liver is a lobed organ located below the diaphragm that functions to
regulate the chemical composition of blood

-   It receives oxygenated blood via the hepatic artery, which is used
    to sustain liver cells (hepatocytes)
-   It also receives nutrient rich blood from the gut via the portal
    vein
-   Deoxygenated blood is transported from the liver via the hepatic
    vein

The liver functions to process the nutrients absorbed from the gut and
hence regulates the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes

-   It is responsible for the storage and controlled release of key
    nutrients (e.g. glycogen, cholesterol, triglycerides)
-   It is responsible for the detoxification of potentially harmful
    ingested substances (e.g. amino acids, medications, alcohol)
-   It produces plasma proteins that function to maintain sustainable
    osmotic conditions within the bloodstream
-   It is responsible for the breakdown of red blood cells and the
    production of bile salts

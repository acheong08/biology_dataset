Understanding:

â€¢ Â Auxin efflux pumps can set up concentration gradients of auxin in
plant tissue

Â  Â Â 
Auxins are a group of hormones produced by the tip of a shoot or root
(i.e. apical meristems) that regulate plant growth

-   Auxin efflux pumps can set up concentration gradients within tissues
    â€“Â changing the distribution of auxin within the plant
-   These pumps can control the direction of plant growth by determining
    which regions of plant tissue have high auxin levels
-   Auxin efflux pumps can change position within the membrane (due to
    fluidity) and be activated by various factorsÂ 

Auxin has different mechanism of action in the roots of plants versus
the shoots of plants:

-   In the shoots, auxin stimulates cell elongation and thus high
    concentrations of auxin promote growth (cells become larger)
-   In the roots, auxin inhibits cell elongation and thus high
    concentrations of auxin limit growth (cells become relatively
    smaller)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Auxin influences cell growth rates by changing the pattern of gene
expression

Â  Â Â 
Auxin is a plant hormone and influences cell growth rates by changing
the pattern of gene expression with a plantâ€™s cells

-   Auxinâ€™s mechanism of action is different in shoots and roots as
    different gene pathways are activated in each tissue

InÂ shoots, auxin increases the flexibility of the cell wall to promote
plant growth via cell elongation

-   Auxin activates a proton pump in the plasma membrane which causes
    the secretion of H⁺ ions into the cell wall
-   The resultant decrease in pH causes cellulose fibres within the cell
    wall to loosen (by breaking the bonds between them)
-   Additionally, auxin upregulates expression ofÂ expansins, which
    similarly increases the elasticity of the cell wall
-   With the cell wall now more flexible, an influx of water (to be
    stored in the vacuole) causes the cell to increase in size

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Crossing over is the exchange of DNA material between non-sister
homologous chromatids

â€¢ Â Crossing over produces new combinations of alleles on the
chromosomes of the haploid cells

Â  Â Â 
When chiasmata form between bivalents in prophase I, DNA can be
exchanged between non-sister homologous chromatids

This exchange of genetic material is called crossing over and produces
new allele combinations on the chromosomes

These chromosomes that consist of genetic material from both homologues
are called recombinant chromosomes

Crossing over results in new combinations of alleles in haploid cells
and thus increases the genetic diversity of potential offspring

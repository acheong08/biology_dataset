â€¢ Â Evaluation of data on the environmental impact of
glyphosate-tolerant soybeans

Â  Â Â 
Glyphosate-resistant soybeans can tolerate exposure to glyphosate â€“
which is used in agriculture to eliminate weeds (herbicide)

-   Consequently, these transgenic crops have been widely adopted in a
    number of countries around the world

There are several potential environmental benefits and risks associated
with the use of glyphosate-tolerant soybeans

-   These include the impact of tillage, effects on biodiversity and the
    potential for unintended transfer of glyphosate resistance

Impact of Tillage

-   Spraying crops with glyphosate reduces the need for tillage, which
    removes topsoil and increases soil erosion
-   Reducing the amount of tillage will also reduce the associated use
    of fossil fuels, limiting the impact of pollution

Effects on Biodiversity

-   Glyphosate has very low levels of toxicity in animal species and so
    is unlikely to impact population numbers in an ecosystem
-   It is also rapidly degraded by soil microbes and so is unlikely to
    accumulate to dangerous levels within the environment
-   However, the effect of sublethal exposure glysophate has not been
    well studied in most plant and animal models
-   The removal of native weed species by glysophate treatment could
    also adversely effect food chains â€“ reducing biodiversity

Cross Contamination

-   Glyphosate tolerance can potentially be transferred to native
    species â€“ producing weeds that are resistant to the herbicide
-   This impact can be reduced by targeting the resistance gene to
    chlorophyll â€“ preventing its spread in pollen granules
-   Several species of glyphosate-resistant weeds have already been
    identified in the wild

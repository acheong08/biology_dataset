â€¢ Â Construct a diagram of the carbon cycle

The carbon cycle is a biogeochemical cycle whereby carbon is exchanged
between the different spheres of the Earth

-   The four spheres are the atmosphere (air), lithosphere (ground),
    hydrosphere (water / oceans) and biosphere (living things)

Carbon is exchanged between a variety of forms, including:

-   Atmospheric gases â€“ mainly carbon dioxide (CO₂), but also methane
    (CH₄)
-   Oceanic carbonates â€“ including bicarbonates dissolved in the water
    and calcium carbonate in corals and shells
-   As organic materials â€“ including the carbohydrates, lipids and
    proteins found in all living things
-   As non-living remains â€“ such as detritus and fossil fuels

Different processes facilitate the cycling of carbon between the
different forms (e.g. feeding, combustion, etc.)

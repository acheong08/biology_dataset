â€¢ Â The promoter as an example of non-coding DNA with a function

Â  Â Â 
A gene is a sequence of DNA which is transcribed into RNA and contains
three main parts:

Promoter

-   The non-coding sequence responsible for the initiation of
    transcription
-   The core promoter is typically located immediately upstream of the
    geneâ€™s coding sequence
-   The promoter functions as a binding site for RNA polymerase (the
    enzyme responsible for transcription)
-   The binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter is mediated and
    controlled by an array of transcription factors in eukaryotes
-   These transcription factors bind to either proximal control elements
    (near the promoter) or distal control elements (at a distance)

Coding Sequence

-   After RNA polymerase has bound to the promoter, it causes the DNA
    strands to unwind and separate
-   The region of DNA that is transcribed by RNA polymerase is called
    the coding sequence

Terminator

-   RNA polymerase will continue to transcribe the DNA until it reaches
    a terminator sequence
-   The mechanism for transcriptional termination differs between
    prokaryotes and eukaryotes

Antisense vs Sense

A gene (DNA) consists of two polynucleotide strands, but only one is
transcribed into RNA

-   TheÂ antisense strand is the strand that is transcribed into RNA
    -   Its sequence is complementary to the RNA sequence and will be
        the "DNA versionâ€?Â of the tRNA anticodon sequence
    -   The antisense strand is also referred to as the template strand
-   The sense strand is the strand that is not transcribed into RNA
    -   Its sequence will be theÂ â€œDNA versionâ€?Â of the RNA sequence
        (i.e. identical except for T instead of U)
    -   The sense strand is also referred to as the coding strand
        (because it is a DNA copy of the RNA sequence)

Either of the 2 polynucleotide strands may contain a gene, and hence the
determination of sense and antisense is gene specific

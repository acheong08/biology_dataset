Pathogens

A pathogen is a disease causing agent that disrupts the normal
physiology of the infected organism

-   Pathogens can be cellular (e.g. parasites, protozoa, bacteria) or
    acellular (viruses and prions)

Types of Pathogens

[pathogens]

Viruses

-   Viruses are metabolically inert and incapable of reproducing
    independently of a host cell (hence are non-living)
-   They typically consist of an inner core of nucleic acid surrounded
    by a protein coat (capsid)
-   Simpler viruses may lack a capsid (viroids), whilst more complex
    viruses may possess an external lipid envelope
-   Viruses can be either DNA-based (adenoviruses) or RNA-based
    (retroviruses)

Prions

-   A prion is an infectious protein that has folded abnormally into a
    structure capable of causing disease
-   Prions can cause normally folded proteins to refold into the
    abnormal form and hence propagate within a host body
-   Prion proteins aggregate together to form amyloid fibres that cause
    holes to form in the brain (spongiform encephalopathy)
-   Infectious prion proteins have a higher beta-sheet content, making
    them more resistant to denaturation and difficult to treat

Bacteria

-   Bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic cells that can reproduce
    quickly and compete with host cells for space and nutrition
-   Most bacteria are relatively harmless and some may even form
    mutualistic relationships with hosts (e.g. normal gut flora)
-   Bacteria may cause disease by producing toxic compounds (exotoxins)
    or releasing the substances when destroyed (endotoxins)
-   As the toxins retain their destructive capacity beyond bacterial
    death, they are often the cause of food poisoning

Fungi

-   Disease-causing fungi usually attack the body surfaces, including
    the skin and mucous membranes
-   They can be categorised according to whether they are unicellular
    (yeasts) or multicellular (moulds) â€“ most fungi are moulds
-   Moulds consist of branching filaments called hyphae, which may form
    a mass of invading threads called mycelium
-   Examples of fungal infections include thrush (yeast infection) and
    athleteâ€™s foot (mould infection)

Parasites

-   A parasite is an organism that grows and feeds on an organism to the
    detriment of the hostâ€™s survival
-   Parasites can be classed as either ectoparasites (living on the
    surface of the host) or endoparasites (living within the host)
-   Endoparasites can include microparasites (e.g. single-cell protozoa)
    or macroparasites (multicellular helmithes)

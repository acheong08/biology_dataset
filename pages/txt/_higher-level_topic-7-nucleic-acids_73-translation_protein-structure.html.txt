Understanding:

â€¢ Â The sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide is the
primary structure

Â  Â Â 
Primary (1Âº) Structure

-   The first level of structural organisation in a protein is the order
    / sequence of amino acids which comprise the polypeptide chain
-   The primary structure is formed by covalent peptide bonds between
    the amine and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids
-   Primary structure controls all subsequent levels of protein
    organisation because it determines the nature of the interactions
    between R groups of different amino acids

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The secondary structure is the formation ofÂ Î±-helices
andÂ Î²-pleated sheets stabilised by hydrogen bonding

Â  Â Â 
Secondary (2Âº) Structure

-   The secondary structure is the way a polypeptide folds in a
    repeating arrangement to formÂ Î±-helices andÂ Î²-pleated sheets
-   This folding is a result of hydrogen bonding between the amine and
    carboxyl groups of non-adjacent amino acids
-   Sequences that do not form either an alpha helix or beta-pleated
    sheet will exist as a random coil
-   Secondary structure provides the polypeptide chain with a level of
    mechanical stability (due to the presence of hydrogen bonds)
-   In pictures, alpha helices are represented as spirals (purple ;
    left) and beta-pleated sheets as arrows (blue ; right)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The tertiary structure is the further folding of the polypeptide
stabilised by interactions between R groups

Â  Â Â 
Tertiary (3Âº) Structure

-   The tertiary structure is the way the polypeptide chain coils and
    turns to form a complex molecular shape (i.e. theÂ 3D shape)
-   It is caused by interactions between R groups; including H-bonds,
    disulfide bridges, ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions
-   Relative amino acid positions are important (e.g. non-polar amino
    acids usually avoid exposure to aqueous solutions)
-   Tertiary structure may be important for the function of the protein
    (e.g. specificity of active site in enzymes)

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The quaternary structure exists in proteins with more than one
polypeptide chain

Â  Â Â 
Quaternary (4Âº) Structure

-   Multiple polypeptides or prosthetic groups may interact to form a
    single, larger, biologically active protein (quaternary structure)
-   A prosthetic group is an inorganic compound involved in protein
    structure or function (e.g. the heme group in haemoglobin)
-   A protein containing a prosthetic group is called a conjugated
    protein
-   Quaternary structures may be held together by a variety of bonds
    (similar to tertiary structure)

â€¢ Â Recognition of the chambers and valves of the heart and the blood
vessels connected to it in dissected hearts

Â  Â Â or in diagrams of heart structure

Â  Â Â 
A heart is labelled as it would appear in a chest, so the left side of
an image represents the right side of the heart (and vice versa)

-   Hint: Â The left ventricle pumps blood around the entire body and so
    has a noticeably thicker myocardium than the right ventricle

Heart Structure

The structure of the human heart includes the following key components:
Chambers

-   Two atria (singular = atrium) â€“ smaller chambers near top of heart
    that collect blood from body and lungs
-   Two ventricles â€“ larger chambers near bottom of heart that pump
    blood to body and lungs

Heart Valves

-   Atrioventricular valves (between atria and ventricles) â€“ bicuspid
    valve on left side ; tricuspid valve on right side
-   Semilunar valves (between ventricles and arteries) â€“ aortic valve
    on left side ; pulmonary valve on right side

Blood Vessels

-   Vena cava (inferior and superior) feeds into the right atrium and
    returns deoxygenated blood from the body
-   Pulmonary artery connects to the right ventricle and sends
    deoxygenated blood to the lungs
-   Pulmonary vein feeds into the left atrium and returns oxygenated
    blood from the lungs
-   Aorta extends from the left ventricle and sends oxygenated blood
    around the body

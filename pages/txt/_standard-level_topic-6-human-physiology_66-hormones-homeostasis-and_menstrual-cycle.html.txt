Understanding:

â€¢ Â The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive
feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and

Â  Â Â pituitary hormones

Â  Â Â 
The menstrual cycle describes recurring changes that occur within the
female reproductive system to make pregnancy possible

-   Each menstrual cycle lasts roughly one month (~28 days) and begins
    at puberty (menarche) before ending with menopause

There are two key groups of hormones which control and coordinate the
menstrual cycle:

-   Pituitary hormones (FSH and LH) are released from the anterior
    pituitary gland and act on the ovaries to develop follicles
-   Ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone) are released from the
    ovaries and act on the uterus to prepare for pregnancy

Key Events in the Menstrual Cycle

There are four key events that comprise a typical menstrual cycle:
follicular phase, ovulation, luteal phase and menstruation

-   These events are distinguished by changes to hormonal levels,
    follicular development and the status of the endometrium

1. Â Follicular Phase

-   Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is secreted from the anterior
    pituitary and stimulates growth of ovarian follicles
-   The dominant follicle produces estrogen, which inhibits FSH
    secretion (negative feedback) to prevent other follicles growing
-   Estrogen acts on the uterus to stimulate the thickening of the
    endometrial layer

2.Â Â Ovulation

-   Midway through the cycle (~ day 12), estrogen stimulates the
    anterior pituitary to secrete hormones (positive feedback)
-   This positive feedback results in a large surge of luteinizing
    hormone (LH) and a lesser surge of FSH
-   LH causes the dominant follicle to rupture and release an egg
    (secondary oocyte) â€“ this is called ovulation

3.Â Â Luteal Phase

-   The ruptured follicle develops into a slowly degenerating corpus
    luteum
-   The corpus luteum secretes high levels of progesterone, as well as
    lower levels ofÂ oestrogen
-   Estrogen and progesterone act on the uterus to thicken the
    endometrial lining (in preparation for pregnancy)
-   Estrogen and progesterone also inhibit secretion of FSH and LH,
    preventing any follicles from developing

4.Â Â Menstruation

-   If fertilisation occurs, the developing embryo will implant in the
    endometrium and release hormones to sustain the corpusÂ luteum
-   If fertilisation doesnâ€™t occur, the corpus luteum eventually
    degenerates (forming a corpus albicans after ~ 2 weeks)
-   When the corpus luteum degenerates, estrogen and progesteron levels
    drop and the endometrium can no longer be maintained
-   The endometrial layer is sloughed away and eliminated from the body
    as menstrual blood (i.e. a womanâ€™s period)
-   As estrogen and progesterone levels are too now low to inhibit the
    anterior pituitary, the cycle can now begin again

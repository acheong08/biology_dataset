Skill:

â€¢ Â Labelling a diagram of the structure of the human eye

Â  Â Â 
The human eye is the sensory organ responsible for vision (sight
perception)

-   It consists of two fluid-filled cavities separated by a lens
    (anterior = aqueous humour, posterior = vitreous humour)
-   The lens is attached to ciliary muscles, which can contract or relax
    to change the focus of the lens
-   The amount of light that enters the eye via the pupil is controlled
    by the constriction and dilation of the iris
-   The exposed portion of the eye is coated by a transparent layer
    called the cornea, which isÂ lubricated by conjunctiva
-   The internal surface of the eye is composed of three layers â€“ the
    sclera (outer), choroid (middle) and retina (inner)
-   The region of the retina responsible for sharpest vision (i.e. focal
    point) is the foveaÂ centralis (or fovea for short)
-   Nerve signals from the retina are sent via an optic nerve to the
    brain (no retina in this region creates a visual blind spot)

Skill:

â€¢ Â Annotation of a diagram of the retina to show the cell types and
the direction in which light moves

Â  Â Â 
The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that forms the
innermost coat of the internal surface of the eye

-   Two types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) convert light stimuli
    into electrical nerve impulses
-   These nerve impulses are transmitted via bipolar cells to ganglion
    cells, whose fibres from the optic nerve tract
-   The photoreceptors line the rear of the retina (adjacent to the
    choroid), meaning light passes through the other cell layers

â€¢ Â Labelling a diagram of the structure of the human ear

Â Â Â 
The human ear is the sensory organ responsible forÂ hearingÂ (sound
perception)

-   The external part of the ear is called the pinna, whereas the
    internal part of the ear is divided into three sections
-   The outer ear contains the auditory canal, which channel sound waves
    to the tympanic membrane (or eardrum)
-   The middle ear contains three small bones called the ossicles, which
    transfer vibrations to the oval window
-   The inner ear consists of the cochleaÂ and semicircular canals, as
    well as a round window which dissipates vibrations
-   The cochlear converts sound stimuli into electrical nerve impulses,
    which are transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain

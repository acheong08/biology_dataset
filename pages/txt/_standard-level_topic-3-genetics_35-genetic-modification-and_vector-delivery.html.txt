Vector Delivery

In molecular biology, a vector is a vehicle that is used to deliver
genetic material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer

There are several methods for transferring genetic material, but all
mechanisms can be classed as either viral or non-viral

Non-Viral Delivery

A commonly used vector is a plasmid â€“ a circular DNA molecule capable
of self-replication and autonomous protein expression

Plasmids can be introduced to target cells by a variety of means,
including:

-   Electroporation â€“ An electric current is applied to make temporary
    holes in the cell membrane
-   Heat shocking â€“ Thermal energy is used to briefly destabilise the
    cell membrane to allow for vector entry
-   Particle bombardment â€“ DNA-coated particles are shot into the
    cells by a gene gun
-   Microinjection â€“ A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector
    directly into the cell
-   Lipofection â€“ The vector is transferred within a liposome (a
    vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)

Viral Delivery

The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and
utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell

Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can
have both beneficial and detrimental consequences

-   The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be
    driven by endogenous expression patterns
-   A disadvantage of this practice is that there is a risk the random
    insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes

Viruses can have either a DNA genome (adenovirus) or an RNA genome
(retrovirus)

-   Retroviruses use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert
    the RNA sequence into a DNA copy prior to integration

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recombinant DNA can be introduced by direct physical or chemical
methods or indirectly by vectors

Â  Â Â 
Gene delivery is the process of introducing foreign DNA into host cells
for the purpose of genetic modification

-   This delivery may occur directly via physical or chemical methods or
    indirectly via the use of vectors

Physical Delivery

-   Electroporation â€“ An electric charge is applied to cells, which
    permeabilises the membrane so that DNA can enter the cell
-   Microinjection â€“ A fine needle is used to directly inject the
    recombinant DNA into a single host cell
-   Biolistics â€“ Recombinant DNA is coated onto gold particles and
    fired into tissues by a biolistic device (â€˜gene gunâ€™)

Chemical Delivery

-   Calcium chloride â€“ Cells are treated in a calcium chloride
    solution prior to a heat shock (which permeabilises the membrane)Â 
-   Liposomes â€“ Recombinant DNA is stored within a lipid bilayer
    vesicle (liposome), which fuses with the cell via endocytosis

Vector Delivery

-   Agrobacterium tumefaciens â€“ A rod-shaped bacterium that can insert
    a recombinant plasmid into a host cell
-   Tobacco mosaic virus â€“ A retrovirus that can insert genetic
    material into host cells (primarily tobacco plants)

Methods of Gene Delivery

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recombinant DNA can be introduced into whole plants, leaf discs or
protoplasts

Â  Â Â 
Recombinant DNA can be introduced into whole plants, leaf discs or
protoplasts (plant cells with the cell wall removed)

-   Introducing DNA into whole plants can allow for the targeted
    recombination of particular plant tissues
-   Recombinant leaf discs can be regenerated under laboratory
    conditions to form new transgenic plants
-   Protoplasts may take up DNA more easily (due to the absence of a
    cell wall) and can be regenerated into whole plants

When regenerating whole plants, groups of plant cells form a growing
mass (callus) from which plant structures develop

-   Gene delivery systems may be more or less effective depending on the
    target (whole plant, leaf disc or protoplast)

Plant Transgenesis Techniques

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Recombinant DNA must be inserted into the plant cell and taken up
by its chromosome or chloroplast DNAÂ 

Â  Â Â 
When recombinant DNA is inserted into a plant cell, it is either taken
up into a chromosome or into chloroplast DNA

-   Alternatively, the recombinant DNA may remain as an independent
    construct within the cell (i.e. in an autonomous plasmid)

Integrating the target gene into chloroplast DNA offers certain
advantages when developing genetically modified crops

-   Genes found inÂ chloroplast DNA will not be present in pollen
    produced by transgenic plants (no chloroplasts in pollen grains)
-   This means the target gene cannot be accidentally released into wild
    plants via cross-pollination

Functions of Mitosis

Mitosis functions as part of the process by which cells are cloned to
make genetically identical daughter cells

-   There are four key reasons why a cell may be required to divide
    mitotically:

Tissue repair / replacementÂ 

-   Damaged or aged cells replaced with identical healthy ones

Organismal growth

-   Multicellular organisms derive new cells via mitotis

Asexual reproduction

-   Vegetative propagation in plants occurs via mitotic division

Development (of embryos)

-   Zygotes undergo mitosis and differentiate to become embryos

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Variation can be discrete or continuous

â€¢ Â The phenotypes of polygenic characteristics tend to show
continuous variation

Â  Â Â 
Variation in phenotypes for a particular characteristic can be either
discrete (discontinuous) or continuous

-   Monogenic traits (characteristics controlled by a single gene loci)
    tend to exhibit discrete variation, with individuals expressing one
    of a number of distinct phenotypes
-   Polygenic traits (characteristics controlled by more than two gene
    loci) tend to exhibit continuous variation, with an individualâ€™s
    phenotype existing somewhere along a continuous spectrum of
    potential phenotypes

In the case of polygenic inheritance:

-   Increasing the number of loci responsible for a particular trait
    increases the number of possible phenotypesÂ 
-   This results in a phenotypic distribution that follows a Gaussian
    (bell-shaped) normal distribution curve

Maize Grain Colour

An example of a polygenic trait is grain colour in maize (wheat), which
is controlled by three gene loci

-   Grain colour can range from white to dark red, depending on the
    amount of pigment that is expressed

Each gene has two alleles, which either code for red pigment or white
pigment

-   The most frequent combinations have an equal number of the two
    allele types
-   Conversely, combinations of one extreme or the other are relatively
    rare
-   The overall pattern of inheritance shows continuous variation

Application:

â€¢ Â Polygenic traits such as human height may also be influenced by
environmental factors

Â  Â Â 
Phenotypic characteristics are not solely determined by genotype, but
are also influenced by environmental factors

-   The added effect of environmental pressures functions to increase
    the variation seen for a particular trait

One example of a polygenic trait that is influenced by environmental
factors is human height

-   Human height is controlled by multiple genes (polygenic), resulting
    in a bell-shaped spectrum of potential phenotypes
-   Environmental factors such as diet and health (disease) can further
    influence an individual humanâ€™s height

Another example of a polygenic trait that is influenced by environmental
factors is human skin colour

-   Skin colour is controlled by multiple melanin producing genes, but
    is also affected by factors such as sun exposureÂ

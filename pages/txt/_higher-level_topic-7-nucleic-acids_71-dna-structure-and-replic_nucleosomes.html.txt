Understanding:

â€¢ Â Nucleosomes help to supercoil the DNA

Â  Â Â 
In eukaryotic organisms, the DNA is packaged with histone proteins to
create a compacted structure called a nucleosome

-   Nucleosomes help to supercoil the DNA, resulting in a greatly
    compacted structure that allows for more efficient storage
-   Supercoiling helps to protect the DNA from damage and also allows
    chromosomes to be mobile during mitosis and meiosis

Organisation of Eukaryotic DNA

-   The DNA is complexed with eight histone proteins (an octamer) to
    form a complex called aÂ nucleosome
-   Nucleosomes are linked by an additional histone protein (H1 histone)
    to form a string ofÂ chromatosomes
-   These then coil to form aÂ solenoid structureÂ (~6 chromatosomes per
    turn) which is condensed to form aÂ 30 nm fibre
-   These fibres then form loops, which are compressed and folded around
    a protein scaffold to formÂ chromatin
-   Chromatin will then supercoil during cell division to
    formÂ chromosomesÂ that are visible (when stained) under microscope

association between protein and DNAÂ 

Â  Â  within the nucleosome

Â  Â Â 
A nucleosome consists of a molecule of DNA wrapped around a core of
eight histone proteins (an octamer)

-   The negatively charged DNA associates with positively charged amino
    acids on the surface of the histone proteins
-   The histone proteins have N-terminal tails which extrude outwards
    from the nucleosome
-   During chromosomal condensation, tails from adjacent histone
    octamers link up and draw the nucleosomes closer together

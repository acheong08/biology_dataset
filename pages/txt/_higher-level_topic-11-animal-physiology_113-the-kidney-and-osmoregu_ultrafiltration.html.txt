Understanding:

â€¢ Â The ultrastructure of the glomerulus and Bowmanâ€™s capsule
facilitate ultrafiltration

Â  Â Â 
Ultrafiltration is the first of three processes by which metabolic
wastes are separated from the blood and urine is formed

-   It is the non-specific filtration of the blood under high pressure
    and occurs in the Bowmanâ€™s capsule of the nephron

Structure of the Bowmanâ€™s Capsule

-   As the blood moves into the kidney via afferent arterioles it enters
    a knot-like capillary tuft called a glomerulus
-   This glomerulus is encapsulated by the Bowmanâ€™s capsule, which is
    comprised of an inner surface of cells called podocytes
-   Podocytes have cellular extensions called pedicels that wrap around
    the blood vessels of the glomerulus
-   Between the podocytes and the glomerulus is a glycoprotein matrix
    called the basement membrane that filters the blood

Basement Membrane

Blood is filtered by a mesh called the basement membrane, which lies
between the glomerulus and Bowmanâ€™s capsule

-   Glomerular blood vessels are fenestrated (have pores) which means
    blood can freely exit the glomerulus
-   The podocytes of the Bowmanâ€™s capsule have gaps between their
    pedicels, allowing for fluid to move freely into the nephron
-   Consequently, the basement membrane functions as the sole filtration
    barrier within the nephron

The basement membrane is size-selective and restricts the passage of
blood cells and large proteins

-   Hence when the blood is filtered, the filtrate formed does not
    contain any blood cells, platelets or plasma proteins

Hydrostatic Pressure

Ultrafiltration involves blood being forced at high pressure against the
basement membrane, optimising filtration

-   This high hydrostatic pressure is created in the glomerulus by
    having a wide afferent arteriole and a narrow efferent arteriole
-   This means it is easy for blood to enter the glomerulus, but
    difficult for it to exit â€“ increasing pressure within the
    glomerulus
-   Additionally, the glomerulus forms extensive narrow branches, which
    increases the surface area available for filtration
-   The net pressure gradient within the glomerulus forces blood to move
    into the capsule space (forming filtrate)

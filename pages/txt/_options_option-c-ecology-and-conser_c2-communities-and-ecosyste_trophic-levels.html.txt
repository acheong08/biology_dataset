Understanding:

â€¢ Â Most species occupy different trophic levels in multiple food
chains

Â  Â Â 
The position an organism occupies within a feeding sequence is known as
a trophic level

-   Producers always occupy the first trophic level in a feeding
    sequence
-   Primary consumers feed on producers and hence occupy the second
    trophic level
-   Further consumers (e.g. secondary, tertiary, etc.) may occupy
    subsequent trophic levels

The trophic levels in a community are:

Food Chains

A food chain shows the linear feeding relationships between species in a
community

-   Arrows represent the transfer of energy and matter as one organism
    is eaten by another (arrows point in direction of energy flow)
-   The first organism in a food chain is always a producer, followed by
    consumers (primary, secondary, etc.)
-   Most species feeding requirements will consist of multiple food
    chains, with organisms occupying different trophic levels

Understanding:

â€¢ Â A food web shows all the possible food chains in a community

Â  Â Â 
A food web is a diagram that shows how food chains are linked together
into more complex interrrelated feeding relationshipsÂ 
A food web is more representative of actual feeding pathways within an
ecosystem because:

-   Organisms can have more than one food source
-   Organisms can have more than one predator

This means that, unlike a food chain, organisms in a food web can occupy
more than one trophic level

-   Hint: Â When constructing food webs, position organisms at their
    highest trophic level (keeps all arrows pointing in same direction)

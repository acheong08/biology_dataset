Immunity Analogy

Imagine that the human body is like a country and the cells are the
individual people that live in the country

-   Groups of cells may form organs, just like people may form societal
    groups like sporting clubs or occupations

Pathogens are foreign bodies that cause disease, similar to the way in
which criminals cause mayhem and damage

-   Pathogens can either cause damage endogenously (i.e. attack from
    abroad) or exogenously (i.e. attack from within)

The immune system is the bodyâ€™s defence force and is comprised of
three distinct levels of defenceÂ 

-   The first line of defence are surface barriers which function like
    physical borders (walls, moats, oceans) to keep criminals out
-   The second line of defence is the innate immune system, which is
    akin to the nationâ€™s standard police force
-   The third line of defence is the adaptive immune system, which is
    akin to a nationâ€™s special forces (army, super heroes, etc.)

Both the innate and adaptive immunity fight off infection concurrently,
however there are key differences between the two:

-   The innate immune system is quick to respond but is non-specific
    (just like police are first on the scene but lack special training)
-   The adaptive immune system is slower to respond but is specific
    (special forces take longer to mobilise but are better trained)
-   The innate immune system present antigens (information about
    specific pathogens) to the adaptive immune system
-   Based on the antigens (information) presented, appropriate
    antibodies (weapons) are made to combat the threat

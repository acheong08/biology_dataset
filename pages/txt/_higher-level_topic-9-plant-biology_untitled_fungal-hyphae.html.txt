Fungal Hyphae

Hyphae are the tubular projections of multicellular fungi that form a
filamentous network (mycelium)

-   Fungal hyphae release digestive enzymes in order toÂ absorb
    nutrients from food sources

Certain species of fungi may form a symbiotic relationship with plants
whereby both species benefit (mutualism)

-   The hyphae penetrate into the plantâ€™s root tissue in response to
    chemical exudates produced by both plant and fungus
-   Within the cortical cells of the root, the hyphae form arbuscular
    projections which absorb nutrients from the plant cells
-   In return, the fungus transfers minerals absorbed from the soil into
    the plant, so both species benefit from the interaction

Understanding:

â€¢ Â The replication of DNA is semi-conservative and depends on
complementary base pairing

Â  Â Â 
DNA replication is a semi-conservative process, because when a new
double-stranded DNA molecule is formed:

-   One strand will be from the original template molecule
-   One strand will be newly synthesised

Semi-Conservative DNA Molecule

[semi-conservative DNA]

This occurs because each nitrogenous base can only pair with its
complementary partner

-   Adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T)
-   Cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G)

Consequently, when DNA is replicated by the combined action of helicase
and DNA polymerase:

-   Each new strand formed will be identical to the original strand
    separated from the template
-   The two semi-conservative molecules formed will have an identical
    base sequence to the original molecule

Skill:

â€¢ Â Analysis of Meselson and Stahlâ€™s results to obtain support for
the theory of semi-conservative replication of DNA

Â  Â Â 
The theory that DNA replication was semi-conservative was confirmed by
the Meselson-Stahl experiment in 1958

Prior to this experiment, three hypotheses had been proposed for the
method of replication of DNA:

-   Conservative Model â€“ An entirely new molecule is synthesised from
    a DNA template (which remains unaltered)
-   Semi-Conservative Model â€“ Each new molecule consists of one newly
    synthesised strand and one template strand
-   Dispersive Model â€“ New molecules are made of segments of new and
    old DNA

Three Proposed Models of DNA Replication

[Models of replication]

Meselson and Stahl were able to experimentally test the validity of
these three models using radioactive isotopes of nitrogen

-   Nitrogen is a key component of DNA and can exist as a heavier ¹⁵N or
    a lighter ¹⁴NÂ 

DNA molecules were prepared using the heavier ¹⁵N and then induced to
replicate in the presence of the lighter ¹⁴N

-   DNA samples were then separated via centrifugation to determine the
    composition of DNA in the replicated molecules

The results after two divisions supported the semi-conservative model of
DNA replication

-   After one division, DNA molecules were found to contain a mix of ¹⁵N
    and ¹⁴N, disproving the conservative model
-   After two divisions, some molecules of DNA were found to consist
    solely of ¹⁴N, disproving the dispersive model

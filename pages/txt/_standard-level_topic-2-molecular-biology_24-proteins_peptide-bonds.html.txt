Understanding:

â€¢ Â Amino acids are linked together by condensation to form
polypeptides

Â  Â Â 
Amino acids can be covalently joined together in a condensation reaction
to form a dipeptide and water

The covalent bond between the amino acids is called a peptide bond and,
for this reason, long chains of covalently bonded amino acids are called
polypeptides

Polypeptide chains can be broken down via hydrolysis reactions, which
requires water to reverse the process

Skill:

â€¢ Â Drawing molecular diagrams to show the formation of a peptide bond

Â  Â Â 
Peptide bonds are formed between the amine and carboxylic acid groups of
adjacent amino acids

-   The amine group loses a hydrogen atom (H) and the carboxylic acid
    loses a hydroxyl (OH) â€“ this forms water (H₂O)Â

Understanding:

â€¢ Â Species are groups of organisms that can potentially interbreed to
produce fertile offspring

â€¢ Â Members of a species may be reproductively isolated in separate
populations

A species is a group of organisms that can potentially interbreed to
produce fertile, viable offspring

-   Members of a single species are unable to produce fertile, viable
    offspring with members from a different species
-   When two different species do produce offspring by cross-breeding,
    these hybrids areÂ reproductively sterile (e.g. liger, mule)

A population is a group of organisms of the same species that are living
in the same area at the same timeÂ 

-   Organisms that live in different regions (i.e. different
    populations) are reproductively isolated and unlikely to interbreed,
    however are classified as the same species if interbreeding is
    functionally possible

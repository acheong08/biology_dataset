â€¢ Â Interpretation of electron micrographs to identify organelles
andÂ deduce the function of specialised cells

Â  Â Â 
A micrograph is a photo or digital image taken through a microscope to
show a magnified image of a specimen

While organelles have identifying structures, specific shapes may vary
depending on the location of cross-sections

Attempts can be made to deduce cell function based on the relative
abundance of various organelles:

-   Mitochondria â€“ Cells with many mitochondria typically undertake
    energy-consuming processes (e.g. neurons, muscle cells)
-   ER â€“ Cells with extensive ER networks undertake secretory
    activities (e.g. plasma cells, exocrine gland cells)
-   Lysosomes â€“ Cells rich in lysosomes tend to undertake digestive
    processes (e.g. phagocytes)
-   Chloroplasts â€“ Cells with chloroplasts undergo photosynthesis
    (e.g. plant leaf tissue but not root tissue)
